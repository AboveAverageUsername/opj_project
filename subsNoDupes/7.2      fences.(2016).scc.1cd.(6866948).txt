00:00:57,019 --> 00:01:01,508
"CERCAS"

3
00:01:06,135 --> 00:01:08,181
Troy, you must stop lying.

4
00:01:08,182 --> 00:01:11,187
Not lying, the black had a watermelon of this size and said:

5
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:13,008
"What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"

6
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:14,390
I almost fall.

7
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:17,896
"What watermelon, Mr. Rand?" And it was right there.

8
00:01:17,897 --> 00:01:19,953
- What Mr. Rand say? - Nothing.

9
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,643
The black is too dumb to know that wearing a watermelon,

10
00:01:22,644 --> 00:01:24,403
did not make much sense to him.

11
00:01:24,404 --> 00:01:27,199
He tried to hide that huge watermelon under his coat.

12
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,819
Afraid that the white man saw him take home.

13
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:33,147
I'm like you, I have no time for that kind of people.

14
00:01:33,148 --> 00:01:34,448
But why he looked angry

15
00:01:34,449 --> 00:01:36,808
to see the face of union man talking to Mr. Rand?

16
00:01:36,809 --> 00:01:38,109
He came to me saying:

17
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,991
"Troy Maxson will get us fired."

18
00:01:39,992 --> 00:01:41,956
I told him to stay away from me with those things.

19
00:01:41,957 --> 00:01:44,803
It was calling "troublemakers".

20
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:47,672
- What Mr. Rand say? - He said nothing.

21
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:50,204
He told me to go to the commissioner's office on Friday. High!

22
00:01:50,205 --> 00:01:52,081
I was called there to see them.

23
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:55,393
Well, while you have your claim can not fire.

24
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:58,127
- It was what he told me one of them. - I do not care to get me fired.

25
00:01:58,128 --> 00:02:00,335
Will they fire me because I asked a question?

26
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:03,564
It was all I did. I went with Mr. Rand and asked.

27
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:07,355
I asked why, why whites and blacks lead load?

28
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:09,036
I said, "What is the problem Did not I tell?"

29
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:11,511
Do you think that only the whites know how to drive a truck?

30
00:02:11,512 --> 00:02:13,801
For this you need a role. Anyone can do it.

31
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:16,243
How is it that all white lead and black bear?

32
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,472
He said: "Talk about it with the union."

33
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,543
Well, it's what I'll do. Now they will come to me with that pile of lies.

34
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:27,484
Brownie told that if they come to ask something to tell the truth.

35
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:30,461
It's just something they invented you because you made the complaint.

36
00:02:30,462 --> 00:02:33,321
Brownie does not understand much, do not worry about anything.

37
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:35,390
All I want is to change the job description,

38
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:37,078
that give everyone a chance to drive the truck.

39
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:41,162
Brownie does not see that, do not understand things.

40
00:03:02,547 --> 00:03:05,051
How do you think you get to be with this girl

41
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,555
Taylor is on all the time, that such Alberta?

42
00:03:07,556 --> 00:03:09,503
- Who? - Brownie.

43
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:13,476
Like you and me. Gets the same as us, which is nothing.

44
00:03:13,477 --> 00:03:15,034
If not?

45
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:17,308
I think you do better than me.

46
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:18,922
And I will not tell you what I do.

47
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:21,216
Black, look here, I know you.

48
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:23,076
If you had come somewhere with that girl,

49
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,412
20 minutes later you'd be looking for someone to tell.

50
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,851
And the first thing you say when you wanted to show off, is me.

51
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:30,466
I did not say that.

52
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:33,239
I see you have cast the eye.

53
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,616
I do it all. I do not miss anything.

54
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:38,350
Anyone tell you that Troy Maxson does not look at women.

55
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,906
You've been doing more than that, you invite one or two drinks.

56
00:03:40,907 --> 00:03:43,253
Of course, I invited her to a drink. What about it? I also paid one.

57
00:03:43,254 --> 00:03:46,337
What does he invite a drink? I'm just being polite.

58
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:49,505
Pay him a drink is fine, that's what's being polite.

59
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:50,922
But when you want to invite two or three,

60
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:53,022
to that it is what you call keeping an eye.

61
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:56,413
Look, since you know me, did you see me chasing women?

62
00:03:56,414 --> 00:04:00,451
Of course! Since you know, you forget that you knew that.

63
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:02,250
No, I mean since I married Rose.

64
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:04,736
Not since you married Rose.

65
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:06,650
That's true. I agree.

66
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:08,312
Okay then. Case closed.

67
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,341
I saw you walking down the house of Alberta.

68
00:04:11,342 --> 00:04:14,337
You were supposed to Taylor's, and you were walking there.

69
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,448
Why do you watch where I'm going? I'm not watching.

70
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:18,667
I saw you I saw walking around more than once.

71
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:22,010
You can see me going anywhere, it means nothing that you saw me.

72
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,707
By the way where she come from? It came out of nowhere one day.

73
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:28,077
Tallahassee. Only see it you realize that it is in Florida.

74
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:30,355
They have very healthy women over there.

75
00:04:30,356 --> 00:04:32,073
They grow from the same soil.

76
00:04:32,074 --> 00:04:34,066
There are some Indian in it.

77
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,232
Most blacks in Florida have some Indian.

78
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:40,430
I do not know what the Indian side, but it sure is very healthy.

79
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:43,393
The woman wears a great stockings.

80
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:47,832
She has great legs and hips as wide as the Mississippi River.

81
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,786
The legs are useless, what you do is remove the medium.

82
00:04:50,787 --> 00:04:53,478
But the hips cushion the ride.

83
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:55,521
Troy, you're crazy.

84
00:04:55,522 --> 00:04:58,265
It is true. It's like riding with a pair of Goodyears.

85
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,612
What are you two talking about?

86
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:05,658
Why do you care about what we talked about, woman?

87
00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:07,082
It is a talk of men.

88
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,029
Who says I care? 驴Bono, you'll stay for dinner?

89
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,693
No, thank you, Rose. But Lucille said she cooked a pork leg.

90
00:05:13,694 --> 00:05:16,117
驴Pork leg? Damn, I go home with you.

91
00:05:16,118 --> 00:05:18,064
It could even sleep over if you give me pork leg.

92
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:20,086
Do you have anything that exceeds a leg of pork, Rose?

93
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:22,626
I'm doing chicken, some chicken and collard greens.

94
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:25,331
Well, back to the house and let me finish what I was talking to Bono.

95
00:05:25,332 --> 00:05:27,829
This is a talk of men. I'll talk to you later.

96
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,955
You know what kind of conversation is.

97
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:33,173
- Come in and ... I emp贸lvatelo. - Troy, just that.

98
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,693
Woman, come here.

99
00:05:36,995 --> 00:05:38,588
M铆rala, Bono.

100
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:41,506
When I met this woman for the first time,

101
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,754
I left that place and said:

102
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:47,089
"Amarren my pony, saddled my mare

103
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,770
there is a woman out there for me somewhere. "

104
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:53,274
I looked here and there, I saw Rose and clung to her.

105
00:05:53,275 --> 00:05:55,844
I grabbed her and said:

106
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:57,406
I'll tell you the truth.

107
00:05:57,407 --> 00:05:58,773
I grabbed her and said:

108
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:01,084
"Honey, do not want to marry.

109
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:03,375
I just want to be your man. "

110
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:06,039
Rose said ... tell me what you told me, Rose.

111
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,911
I told him if was the kind of things not marry,

112
00:06:07,912 --> 00:06:10,364
to leave for those who did marry me find.

113
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:12,912
What he told me was: "Black, you're in my way,

114
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:16,034
tapas me sight. Salt means for you to find me a husband. "

115
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:17,653
I thought for two or three days.

116
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:20,059
They were not two or three days. Came back the same night.

117
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,728
Back and say:

118
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:24,760
"All right, honey, but I'm going to buy a rooster and

119
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:27,543
I'll put it in the yard so that when you see a stranger,

120
00:06:27,544 --> 00:06:29,039
bata their wings and get to sing. "

121
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,411
Look good, Bono. I could see the front door himself,

122
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:33,512
what worried me was the back door.

123
00:06:33,513 --> 00:06:36,813
Troy, you should not talk like that. All you say is a lie.

124
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:39,493
The only thing is that when we got married, forget the rooster ...

125
00:06:39,494 --> 00:06:41,130
We had patio.

126
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:44,780
I know how it is. I and Lucille lived in Logan Street.

127
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:47,204
We had two rooms, with the toilet in the back.

128
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:49,028
I did not care who was outside,

129
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:53,253
but when he passed that damn wind during the winter, then yes.

130
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:57,465
Today I wonder why I stayed there for six long years.

131
00:06:57,466 --> 00:07:00,199
You see, I did not know I could not do anything to improve it.

132
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,104
I thought only white people had toilets inside the house.

133
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:05,910
Many people do not know they can improve what they do now.

134
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:08,940
It's something you have to learn. Many still buy with Bella.

135
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:10,915
There is nothing wrong with buying there. They have fresh food.

136
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:14,040
I did not speak of fresh food, I talk about how much they charge for it.

137
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,159
Charges 10 cents more than A & P.

138
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,317
A & P has never done anything for me. I spend where I was treated well.

139
00:07:19,318 --> 00:07:23,332
I get there and ask for a loaf of bread, I say payment on Friday and give it to me.

140
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,330
What's the point when I have money

141
00:07:25,331 --> 00:07:28,703
and spend it elsewhere ignoring the person who made me well?

142
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:30,963
- That's not in the Bible. - Do not talk about what is in the Bible.

143
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:32,798
What sense is there when it comes to buying you more?

144
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:36,490
You buy anywhere, I'll do it where I can help.

145
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:38,236
I do not think it's right that she copper you more. It's what I say.

146
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:40,973
I have to go, if not going to scold me Lucille.

147
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:44,133
Where are you going, black? Not just this bottle, see have to termin谩rnosla.

148
00:07:44,134 --> 00:07:47,359
I would, if I ever loose.

149
00:07:47,973 --> 00:07:50,147
All I say A & P is

150
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:52,598
Cory glad I got work there.

151
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:54,631
It helps to deal with the costs of school uniform and all.

152
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:57,158
Gabe moved from here and things are tightening.

153
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,859
It has that job, so you can begin to take care of himself.

154
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,063
Cory was recruited by a college football team.

155
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:05,712
I told that boy about football.

156
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:09,225
Whites never let that grow in football.

157
00:08:09,226 --> 00:08:11,497
I said the first time he came to me with that.

158
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:13,932
Now you come and tell me became more involved.

159
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:16,301
It should be recruited on how to fix cars

160
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:17,813
or something where I can make money.

161
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:20,141
He is not talking about making a living playing football.

162
00:08:20,142 --> 00:08:21,989
It's just something that kids do in school.

163
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,877
They will send a recruiter to talk to you.

164
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,449
He will explain that life will not win on that.

165
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,119
It is an honor to be recruited.

166
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,754
He will not get anywhere. Bono you can tell.

167
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:33,690
If you are going to be like you in sports, it will be fine.

168
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:36,544
There are only two men who played baseball as well as you.

169
00:08:36,545 --> 00:08:38,623
Babe Ruth y Josh Gibson.

170
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:40,884
They are the only two who have hit more home runs than you.

171
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:43,141
And what it is what gave me? I have no where to urinate,

172
00:08:43,142 --> 00:08:44,657
or a window from where to throw the water.

173
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,376
When you played times have changed, Troy.

174
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:48,587
That was before the war. Times have changed a lot.

175
00:08:48,588 --> 00:08:51,455
- How the hell changed? - There are a lot of color playing now.

176
00:08:51,456 --> 00:08:53,968
- Baseball and football. - You're right about that, Rose.

177
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:57,443
Times have changed, Troy. You came too early.

178
00:08:57,444 --> 00:09:00,878
There has never been a time called "too early".

179
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,824
This man, for example ...

180
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,532
What was the one who had playing right field in Yankees?

181
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:09,228
You know who I mean, Bono. He played in right field for the Yankees.

182
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:11,421
- Selkirk? - Selkirk yeah, that one.!

183
00:09:11,422 --> 00:09:13,821
You batted .269 average, understand?

184
00:09:13,822 --> 00:09:16,012
.269! What sense does that make?

185
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,794
I was hitting .432 with 37 home runs,

186
00:09:18,795 --> 00:09:21,731
that .269 and playing right field for the Yankees.

187
00:09:21,732 --> 00:09:24,134
I saw Josh Gibson's daughter yesterday.

188
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:26,705
He walked around with ragged shoes on the feet.

189
00:09:26,706 --> 00:09:30,227
I bet the daughter of Selkirk does not walk with shoes as well.

190
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:32,298
Many players have color now,

191
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:35,052
Jackie Robinson was the first. We all had to wait for him.

192
00:09:35,053 --> 00:09:38,383
I have seen hundreds of blacks better than Jackie Robinson play.

193
00:09:38,384 --> 00:09:41,147
Hell, I know some teams where Jackie and entered.

194
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:44,345
What are you talking about Jackie Robinson. He was nobody.

195
00:09:44,346 --> 00:09:47,218
What I say is that if you can play, they should let you play.

196
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,242
No matter what color you are. I do not give me that I arrived very early.

197
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:52,494
If you can play, they should let you play.

198
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:56,559
You'll both die of drink. You do not need to drink as well.

199
00:09:58,252 --> 00:10:00,279
The death is nothing. I have seen her.

200
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,458
I fought with her. You can not tell me anything of death.

201
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,906
Death is nothing more than a fastball on the outside corner,

202
00:10:05,907 --> 00:10:07,955
and you know what I do that.

203
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:09,768
Hold on here, Bono. I'm lying?

204
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:12,852
When it comes a fastball, to the waist,

205
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:14,477
at the corner outside the plate where

206
00:10:14,478 --> 00:10:16,196
you can hold the bat hard and ...

207
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:20,551
And God! You can kiss goodbye. I'm lying?

208
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:23,175
No, you're right. I've seen him do it.

209
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:26,823
If I'm lying, they are lying 137 meters.

210
00:10:26,824 --> 00:10:28,452
That is all that is death to me:

211
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:30,990
A fastball on the outside corner.

212
00:10:30,991 --> 00:10:33,268
I do not know why you want to keep talking about death.

213
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:35,367
There is nothing wrong with talking about death, that's part of life.

214
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:39,772
We all die, you die, I also like Bono. We will all die.

215
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,175
But you do not have to talk about it. I do not like.

216
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:45,126
It was you who mentioned it, Bono and I were talking baseball.

217
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:48,416
You told me to die so much drink. Not so, Bono?

218
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:50,923
You know I do not drink this but one night a week.

219
00:10:50,924 --> 00:10:53,633
And it's Friday night. I will spend my drink without limit.

220
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:55,301
Then I will not touch, I shall leave aside.

221
00:10:55,302 --> 00:10:57,676
So do not worry if I'm going to die of so much drinking,

222
00:10:57,677 --> 00:10:59,277
because death does not worry me.

223
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:01,506
And I saw and I struggled with it.

224
00:11:01,855 --> 00:11:03,201
Hear this, Bono.

225
00:11:03,202 --> 00:11:06,749
One day I saw that death came marching straight toward me.

226
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,212
As soldiers on parade. The army death

227
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:14,500
He was marching straight toward me. It was mid-July 1941.

228
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:17,138
It was very cold, and winter.

229
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:20,836
Death itself reached out and touched my shoulder.

230
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:22,851
He touched me as I touch you now.

231
00:11:22,852 --> 00:11:25,593
I froze and death was standing there smiling at me.

232
00:11:25,594 --> 00:11:29,138
- Troy, why not stop talking. - I said, "What do you want, Mrs. Death?

233
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:32,458
Am I you looking for? Is he commanded his army to arrest me? "

234
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,843
I looked straight into his eyes. She was not any fear.

235
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:37,752
He was ready for action, just as I am now.

236
00:11:37,753 --> 00:11:39,690
The Bible says that we are attentive.

237
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:42,378
So I never get drunk. I need to be alert.

238
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:45,482
Troy was hospitalized at Mercy Hospital, you remember that had pneumonia?

239
00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:47,309
Lying there with a fever talking nonsense.

240
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,335
Death was standing there looking at me with that sickle in his hand.

241
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:56,422
Finally he tells me: "Do you want to continue life more than one year?"

242
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:57,733
I said, well said ...

243
00:11:57,734 --> 00:12:02,500
"Do you want to continue one more year of life?"

244
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:06,272
I said, "! Continue in hell Let's settle this now."

245
00:12:06,273 --> 00:12:08,527
It seems that recanted when I said that.

246
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:09,947
Then all I was cold.

247
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:12,102
I went down, I grabbed that sickle,

248
00:12:12,103 --> 00:12:15,509
I threw it as far as I could and the two began to fight.

249
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,134
We fight for ... up one, they van 6 ...

250
00:12:18,135 --> 00:12:19,700
Three days and three nights!

251
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:21,487
I do not know where I got the strength,

252
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:23,360
every time it seemed I was going to win,

253
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:26,110
He looked deep in my soul

254
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,606
and was forces to combat it.

255
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:30,521
Whenever Troy tells that story finds different ways of doing it.

256
00:12:30,522 --> 00:12:32,289
several different things that invents appear.

257
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,270
I'm not inventing anything, woman. I'm just saying the facts of what happened.

258
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:39,600
I struggled with death for 3 days and 3 nights and I'm here to tell the tale.

259
00:12:41,985 --> 00:12:44,419
Well ... at the end of the third night

260
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,626
We weaken us so much we could hardly move.

261
00:12:47,627 --> 00:12:49,422
Dying rose, he threw his robe ...

262
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:51,299
It was white, with a hood.

263
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,798
He threw the robe and went out to get his sickle and said:

264
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,143
"I will be back." Walking and ...

265
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:58,483
"I will be back."

266
00:12:58,484 --> 00:13:01,448
I said, "Yeah. Well, you have to find me."

267
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:05,591
He was no fool, did not want to die. We can not play with it.

268
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:09,058
I know one day I catch you, I know I'll join his army,

269
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,058
his companions.

270
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:13,193
But while you have strength and see arrive,

271
00:13:13,194 --> 00:13:15,486
while continuing alert,

272
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:17,278
You will have to fight me to get me.

273
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,793
It will not be easy.

274
00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:22,159
Well, look over here. Since you have to be alert,

275
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,048
let me stay with the bottle.

276
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:27,362
I should not have told you that part. I should remove it.

277
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:28,971
Troy goes around talking about it and half the time

278
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:31,431
and he does not know what he's talking about.

279
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:33,816
- Bono knows me well. - So is.

280
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:36,623
I know you have a bit of Uncle Remus in the blood.

281
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:39,016
You have more stories than the devil has sinners.

282
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:41,616
To him I've seen. I have spoken with the devil.

283
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:47,338
Hello, old.

284
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,063
Why do you leave me with that "Hello, old man?"

285
00:13:49,064 --> 00:13:50,551
How you doing, Rose?

286
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:53,768
Sir Bono, how are you?

287
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:55,473
Hello, Lyons. How have you been?

288
00:13:55,474 --> 00:13:58,161
Should do well, no I saw it here last week.

289
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:01,349
Troy, leave your son alone. Whenever you start coming to see you with that.

290
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,516
I'm not bothering. Take baby. We understand each other.

291
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:07,758
I know why you come to me and he knows I know.

292
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,562
Come on, Dad. Just passing to say hello and see how you were.

293
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:11,865
Yesterday you did not pass.

294
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:14,111
Will you stay to eat, Lyons? I have the chicken in the oven.

295
00:14:14,112 --> 00:14:17,538
No, Rose, thank you. It was in the neighborhood and thought I'd spend a minute.

296
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:20,527
You were in the neighborhood yes, black. There they told the truth.

297
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:22,360
You were in the neighborhood because it is the day of my pay.

298
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,110
Well, since you mentioned it, why not give me $ 10.

299
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:26,647
Fuck!

300
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:28,472
I die, I'm going to hell

301
00:14:28,473 --> 00:14:31,311
and play blackjack with the devil before you ten dollars.

302
00:14:31,312 --> 00:14:34,093
That's what I want to know, that devil you saw.

303
00:14:34,094 --> 00:14:36,389
Dad saw the devil? Yes you are exaggerated, Dad.

304
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,577
- I saw him and talked with him as well. - You have not seen anyone.

305
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,871
I told you that man has nothing to do with the devil.

306
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:43,134
Everything you do not understand, want to call the devil.

307
00:14:43,135 --> 00:14:46,359
Look over here, Bono. I went to Hertzberger for some furniture.

308
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,313
"Three beds for $ 298." It is what was said on the radio.

309
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:52,835
"Three beds for $ 298." They did even a little music.

310
00:14:52,836 --> 00:14:55,939
I get there and the man tells me he could not give me credit.

311
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,287
I work all day and I can not take credit.

312
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:01,206
What was he doing? I have an empty house with old furniture.

313
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:04,446
Cory does not have bed, sleeping on top of a pile of rags on the floor.

314
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,752
I work all day and I can not open credit.

315
00:15:06,753 --> 00:15:10,090
I returned, ask Rose, dudgeon. Trying to think what to do.

316
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:12,544
Someone knocks on the door. He had lived only three days here.

317
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:13,894
Who knows you live here?

318
00:15:13,895 --> 00:15:16,059
I open the door and the devil standing there, imposing.

319
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,281
A white guy, good clothes. Standing with a clipboard in hand.

320
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:22,835
I did not have to say anything, the first thing he said was:

321
00:15:22,836 --> 00:15:25,975
"I know you need some furniture and could not get credit."

322
00:15:25,976 --> 00:15:27,282
I nearly fell there.

323
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:29,740
He said: "I give all the credit you want,

324
00:15:29,741 --> 00:15:31,740
but you have to pay the interest. "

325
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:34,534
I said, "Give me three beds, charge me whatever you want."

326
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:38,122
The next day came a truck and two men unloaded three beds.

327
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:40,478
The driver of the truck gave me a book.

328
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:43,914
It said, "Send $ 10 the first of each month to the address book

329
00:15:43,915 --> 00:15:45,222
And everything will be fine."

330
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:49,348
"If missing a payment, and the devil would be hell to pay."

331
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:52,270
That was 15 years ago, to this very day

332
00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:54,866
the first of every month, I send my $ 10.

333
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:56,434
Specifically, ask Rose.

334
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:59,091
- Troy is lying. - I've never seen this man.

335
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,128
Tell me then who could have been but the devil.

336
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:04,283
And I did not sell my soul or anything.

337
00:16:04,284 --> 00:16:07,149
I would not do anything like that with the devil, but I have my furniture.

338
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,737
And send my $ 10 on time.

339
00:16:09,738 --> 00:16:12,789
How long you say you've been sending the $ 10 a month?

340
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,787
- For 15 years. - And still not finished paying?

341
00:16:15,788 --> 00:16:17,736
How much you charged the man?

342
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:20,877
And I finished paying, I paid about 10 times.

343
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:23,126
- But I have afraid to stop. - He is lying.

344
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:24,863
We bought the furniture to Mr. Glickman.

345
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:26,567
he is not paying anyone $ 10.

346
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,038
And woman, Bono knows I'm not that dumb.

347
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:31,700
I was about to say I know where there is a bridge for sale.

348
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:34,545
I tell you one thing, I do not care if it was the devil.

349
00:16:34,546 --> 00:16:37,035
I do not care if he gives credit. Someone has to give.

350
00:16:37,036 --> 00:16:40,343
You should matter. Andas saying that bargained with the devil,

351
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:43,598
God is the one who must answer. He is the one who will judge you.

352
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:46,631
Yes. Well, look Dad, give me the $ 10. I will return you.

353
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,470
Bonnie got a job at the hospital.

354
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:50,410
What'd I tell you, Bono? The only time I see this black

355
00:16:50,411 --> 00:16:52,847
It is when he wants something. It's the only time I see it.

356
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:55,008
Come on, Dad. Mr. Bono will not have to hear all that.

357
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:57,270
Give me $ 10. I told you that Bonnie is working.

358
00:16:57,271 --> 00:16:59,697
What does that mean for me? I do not care if she works.

359
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:01,913
Ask her the $ 10 if you are working.

360
00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:03,341
I you go out with that "Bonnie is working".

361
00:17:03,342 --> 00:17:04,794
Why you do not work?

362
00:17:04,795 --> 00:17:07,037
Dad, you know I can not find a decent job.

363
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:09,284
Where do I find one? You know I can not get one.

364
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:11,601
I said I know some people there.

365
00:17:11,602 --> 00:17:14,254
I can get something in the trash if you want to work. I already told you

366
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:16,515
the last time you came here asking.

367
00:17:16,516 --> 00:17:19,356
No, Dad, thank you. That's not for me, I do not want to load the garbage from anyone.

368
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:21,081
I do not want anyone pull the recorder clock.

369
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,390
What is the problem? Are you too good to load the garbage outside?

370
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:25,354
Where do you think are the $ 10 of which you speak?

371
00:17:25,355 --> 00:17:27,078
I am supposed to charge the trash of others

372
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,046
and give my money because you're too lazy to work?

373
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:31,921
You're too lazy to work and you wonder why you do not have mine.

374
00:17:31,922 --> 00:17:33,912
What hospital works Bonnie? In the Mercy?

375
00:17:33,913 --> 00:17:35,612
It is in the Passavant working in the laundry.

376
00:17:35,613 --> 00:17:37,368
I will not give anything. If I give you $ 10,

377
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:38,840
I eat beans the rest of the week.

378
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:40,685
You will not get $ 10 here.

379
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:42,899
You do not have to eat beans. I do not know why you say that.

380
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,948
I do not spare the money!

381
00:17:46,492 --> 00:17:50,382
Gabe moved, I paid the rent to Mrs. Pearl,

382
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:51,906
and things have been tight.

383
00:17:51,907 --> 00:17:53,590
I can not afford to give money forever.

384
00:17:53,591 --> 00:17:56,375
I did not ask you to give me anything, just like the I borrowed.

385
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,489
- I know you have $ 10. - Yes I have them.

386
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,860
You know why? Because I do not waste my money on the streets.

387
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:05,947
You want to live the easy life, being a musician and riding clubs.

388
00:18:05,948 --> 00:18:07,472
Then you learn to take care of yourself.

389
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:10,051
Ever you see anyone asking me anything.

390
00:18:10,386 --> 00:18:13,358
- Need I spent many years. - We're different, Dad.

391
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,823
I learned from my mistakes and how to make things right.

392
00:18:16,824 --> 00:18:19,783
You try to get something for free. Life owes you nothing.

393
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:22,637
You owe it to yourself. Ask Bono, will tell you I'm right.

394
00:18:22,638 --> 00:18:25,076
You have your way of dealing with the world, I have mine.

395
00:18:25,077 --> 00:18:26,978
The only thing that matters is the music.

396
00:18:26,979 --> 00:18:29,319
Yes, I see it. Not interested in how you are eating,

397
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,316
where is your next money. Yes, you tell the truth.

398
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:34,712
I know I have to eat, but I have to live.

399
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,978
I need something to help me get out of bed in the morning.

400
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:39,964
That makes me feel part of the world. Not bother anyone.

401
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:41,894
I'll just stick with my music because

402
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:43,694
it is the only way of life I found in this life.

403
00:18:43,695 --> 00:18:46,084
Otherwise, no one would know what you could do.

404
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:49,158
I'm not here to criticize you or the way you live.

405
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:51,536
I just came to ask you for $ 10.

406
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:53,504
I do not want to hear all this about how to live.

407
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:56,238
Boy, your mother spent a lot of work to raise you.

408
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:59,238
You can not change me, Dad. Now I have 34 years.

409
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:03,011
If you want change, you should be there when growing up.

410
00:19:03,012 --> 00:19:04,687
I just came to see you.

411
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:07,821
I asked $ 10, and want to talk about how I was raised.

412
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,044
You have no idea how I was raised.

413
00:19:17,094 --> 00:19:20,010
Give him $ 10 the boy, Troy.

414
00:19:23,939 --> 00:19:25,729
What the fuck are you looking at me?

415
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,891
I do not have, you know what I do with my money.

416
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:31,205
Give you the $ 10 if you want to give them.

417
00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:33,883
I will, as soon as the des me.

418
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:38,713
Are here.

419
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:41,957
76 dollars and 22 cents.

420
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,978
Did you see that, Bono? I will not see a penny of it.

421
00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:48,259
To be lying. Take, Lyons.

422
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,693
Thank you, Rose.

423
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:56,164
I have to go, see you later.

424
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:58,585
Wait a minute. You say "thank you, Rose,"

425
00:19:58,586 --> 00:20:00,433
but not put to see where she got the money.

426
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:02,457
- Did you see how is the thing, Bono? - I know I got you, dad.

427
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,886
- Thank you, I will return. - Now you're lying again.

428
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:07,375
When you pay me the $ 10, you will be owing me $ 30 more.

429
00:20:07,376 --> 00:20:09,483
- See you, Mr. Bono. - Take care of yourself, Lyons.

430
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:12,541
Thanks Dad. See you soon.

431
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,552
I do not know why it will not

432
00:20:15,553 --> 00:20:18,141
and is looking for a decent job and take care of the wife he has.

433
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:20,922
It will be fine, Troy. The boy is still young.

434
00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:24,573
- The boy is 34 years old. - Do not start with that.

435
00:20:24,574 --> 00:20:27,452
I have to go, I'm leaving. Lucille is waiting for me.

436
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:29,164
Did you see this woman, Bono?

437
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,915
I love this woman.

438
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:35,097
I love her so much it hurts me.

439
00:20:35,098 --> 00:20:39,485
I love her so much that I ended up loving her wishes.

440
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:42,240
So I need to get back to basics.

441
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,012
Do not come by the house early to say it's time to work.

442
00:20:45,013 --> 00:20:47,038
- I'll still be giving hard. - Troy, for that.

443
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,396
I ignore him, Rose. They are words of drunk.

444
00:20:50,397 --> 00:20:52,716
Continuing, Troy. I'll see you Monday.

445
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:54,534
Do not pass by my house, black!

446
00:20:56,909 --> 00:20:59,126
Already I told you what I'll be doing!

447
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:03,779
Come back on Tuesday!

448
00:21:29,428 --> 00:21:32,946
Jesus, I know a fenced

449
00:21:32,947 --> 00:21:37,603
around me every day.

450
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:44,340
Good Morning.

451
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,865
Ready for breakfast? I can prepar谩rtelo

452
00:21:46,866 --> 00:21:49,083
as soon finish laying these clothes.

453
00:21:49,084 --> 00:21:51,192
already I started making coffee, okay.

454
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:54,414
I just want a bit of that this morning.

455
00:21:55,928 --> 00:21:58,316
He left 651 yesterday.

456
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,615
It is the second time this month, Mrs. Pearl one dollar earned.

457
00:22:01,616 --> 00:22:04,097
It seems that those who least need always lucky.

458
00:22:04,098 --> 00:22:06,862
- The poor never win. - The numbers are nothing.

459
00:22:06,863 --> 00:22:08,993
I do not know why fooled by that, you and Lyons.

460
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,472
It's something to do.

461
00:22:10,473 --> 00:22:12,753
What you're doing is throwing money away.

462
00:22:12,754 --> 00:22:16,308
You know I do not play the fool. Only 5 cts game here or there.

463
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:17,754
His 5 cts that tiraste.

464
00:22:17,755 --> 00:22:20,384
Sometimes I win.

465
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:23,435
It is balanced, always good when I win. Then do not complain.

466
00:22:23,436 --> 00:22:25,412
I'm not complaining, but I say that's nonsense.

467
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:28,273
Try to guess which of the 600 numbers will come out.

468
00:22:28,274 --> 00:22:30,804
If I had all the money from these black ...

469
00:22:33,674 --> 00:22:37,418
The money from those blacks who pull in lottery for a week,

470
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:40,560
in just one week it would be rich.

471
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:42,185
Well, think and call it nonsense

472
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:45,435
it will not prevent bet on the numbers, that's for sure.

473
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:48,982
Also, good things come to gamble.

474
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:51,999
Look Pope bought the restaurant with numbers.

475
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,376
I hate blacks as well.

476
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,286
The man had not two pennies to live.

477
00:22:57,287 --> 00:23:01,508
He walked with worn shoes asking for money for cigarettes.

478
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:04,306
Okay, looking luck.

479
00:23:04,307 --> 00:23:06,563
- Aci茅rtale numbers. - Troy, and I know the old story.

480
00:23:06,564 --> 00:23:09,172
Ten common sense at least. And I'll tell you, do not throw money.

481
00:23:09,173 --> 00:23:12,813
I have seen black gamble and spend up to two thousand dollars in 4 days.

482
00:23:12,814 --> 00:23:17,327
The man bought the restaurant down, fixed it pretty well,

483
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:19,271
and then not let anyone enter.

484
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,750
If a black went there, nobody attended.

485
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:24,890
I saw a white go in there and make a stew.

486
00:23:24,891 --> 00:23:27,557
Pope pulled all the meat to put it to him.

487
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:29,627
The man no longer had for a meat dish.

488
00:23:29,628 --> 00:23:33,704
A black came up behind him and not give him more than potatoes and carrots.

489
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:36,510
Are you talking with that win the lottery? You picked a bad example.

490
00:23:36,511 --> 00:23:40,483
It is nothing more than a fool worse than it was before.

491
00:23:42,051 --> 00:23:43,915
Troy...

492
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,980
You will have to stop worrying about what happened yesterday at work.

493
00:23:48,952 --> 00:23:50,642
I am not worried.

494
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,464
I just told off Friday to the office of the Commissioner,

495
00:23:54,465 --> 00:23:57,070
Everyone worried that I might be fired,

496
00:23:57,071 --> 00:23:59,224
I do not care about that.

497
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:01,476
You do not have to worry about that.

498
00:24:02,406 --> 00:24:04,292
Where is Cory? It's in the house?

499
00:24:07,556 --> 00:24:09,883
- Cory! - He left.

500
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:12,084
He left? He left,

501
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:15,046
because he knows I want to work on this closely.

502
00:24:15,047 --> 00:24:17,430
I know how he is. That boy is afraid to work.

503
00:24:17,431 --> 00:24:19,965
- He has not worked in your life. - He had football practice.

504
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:23,207
The coach wanted to coach a little more before the season.

505
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,077
I know your workout,

506
00:24:25,078 --> 00:24:27,381
out of here before finishing her chores.

507
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:30,370
驴Troy, what's your problem today? Nothing's okay.

508
00:24:30,371 --> 00:24:32,922
Go back to bed and get up the other side.

509
00:24:32,923 --> 00:24:35,298
Why something must be wrong with me? I said I had something wrong.

510
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:36,880
You got something to say everything.

511
00:24:36,881 --> 00:24:39,150
Numbers first, then the way that restaurant is directed.

512
00:24:39,151 --> 00:24:42,095
Now it is with Cory. What's next?

513
00:24:42,096 --> 00:24:44,222
Look up and see if the weather's okay.

514
00:24:44,223 --> 00:24:47,327
Or is it going to be how you put the fence with the clothes hanging in the yard?

515
00:24:47,328 --> 00:24:48,994
You guessed that.

516
00:24:48,995 --> 00:24:51,242
I know it like the palm of my hand.

517
00:24:51,243 --> 00:24:53,295
Comes to give a little more coffee.

518
00:24:53,296 --> 00:24:56,451
See if that straightens you, because you're not good this morning.

519
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,793
Good...

520
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,138
Prunes!

521
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:20,716
Three for 25 cents!

522
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:23,234
Come and buy now!

523
00:25:23,235 --> 00:25:25,298
Because I am here today

524
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:28,494
and tomorrow I'll be gone!

525
00:25:28,495 --> 00:25:32,798
I ask how to sell them, 10 cts each.

526
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,614
Or three 25 cts!

527
00:25:34,615 --> 00:25:36,445
- Come and buy now! - Hears!

528
00:25:40,727 --> 00:25:44,521
Because I am here today and I'll be gone tomorrow.

529
00:25:44,522 --> 00:25:46,029
There's Troy.

530
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,470
Hi, Troy.

531
00:25:48,796 --> 00:25:50,367
Hola, Gabe.

532
00:25:54,139 --> 00:25:57,481
- Hi, Rose. - Hi, Gabe. What have you got there?

533
00:25:57,482 --> 00:26:00,583
You know what I have, Rose? I fruits and vegetables.

534
00:26:00,584 --> 00:26:02,160
Where are the plums of which you speak?

535
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:04,474
Today I have plums, Rose.

536
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:07,428
I was just singing. I'll bring some tomorrow.

537
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:09,987
I made a large order of plums,

538
00:26:09,988 --> 00:26:14,265
I'll bring enough plums morning to San Pedro and everyone.

539
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:16,754
Troy is upset with me.

540
00:26:17,478 --> 00:26:20,009
I'm not, Gabe. Because it would be?

541
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,335
I have not done anything.

542
00:26:21,336 --> 00:26:25,751
I moved to the house of Mrs. Pearl to not be in your way.

543
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:27,336
I dont want to offend.

544
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:29,951
Who says you offend me? I never said anything like that.

545
00:26:31,343 --> 00:26:33,004
You are not mad with me?

546
00:26:33,005 --> 00:26:36,612
I'm not, Gabe. If I were, I told you.

547
00:26:37,675 --> 00:26:39,309
Come on, get out of the street.

548
00:26:39,782 --> 00:26:41,214
Come on.

549
00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:46,560
I rented two rooms in the basement.

550
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:49,716
I have my own door too. You want to see my key?

551
00:26:51,918 --> 00:26:55,683
This is my own key and no one has a key equal.

552
00:26:55,684 --> 00:26:57,680
It is my key to my two quarters.

553
00:26:57,681 --> 00:26:59,951
That's good, Gabe. You have your own key, that's good.

554
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,993
Are you hungry, Gabe? He was preparing to Troy breakfast.

555
00:27:02,994 --> 00:27:05,812
I accept a biscuit. Have a?

556
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:09,444
Did you know that when I was in heaven,

557
00:27:09,445 --> 00:27:12,585
every morning we would sit San Pedro and me in the door

558
00:27:12,586 --> 00:27:15,272
and we ate some big rolls?

559
00:27:15,273 --> 00:27:17,886
Yes, good time.

560
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:20,357
We sat and ate bagels. Then

561
00:27:20,358 --> 00:27:24,225
San Pedro went to bed and told me to wake him

562
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,519
when it was time to open the doors for trial.

563
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,464
Well, you'll see a lot of rolls.

564
00:27:30,826 --> 00:27:34,303
Troy, San Pedro has your name in the book.

565
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:37,321
I saw him, said: "Troy Maxson."

566
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:41,995
I said, "I know." It has the same name as me.

567
00:27:42,502 --> 00:27:44,750
That's my brother!

568
00:27:46,104 --> 00:27:48,440
How many times going to tell me that, Gabe?

569
00:27:48,441 --> 00:27:51,767
My name was not in the book. They have to have my name.

570
00:27:51,768 --> 00:27:53,909
Already I died and gone to Heaven.

571
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:56,857
But they do have your name.

572
00:27:56,858 --> 00:28:00,394
One morning, San Pedro was looking in his book

573
00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:03,137
making notes for trial,

574
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:07,829
And let me see thy name. It was under the letter "M".

575
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:12,031
It was the name of Rose. It did not look like yours,

576
00:28:12,032 --> 00:28:13,859
but I know it's there.

577
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,265
It had a huge book!

578
00:28:17,004 --> 00:28:20,016
They were the names of all who were born.

579
00:28:20,017 --> 00:28:21,524
That's what he told me, but

580
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:25,420
I saw your name, I saw with my own eyes.

581
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:27,912
Come in, Rose will prepare something to eat.

582
00:28:27,913 --> 00:28:32,860
I'm not hungry. And I had breakfast with Aunt Jemima.

583
00:28:33,248 --> 00:28:37,360
He came and gave me many pancakes!

584
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:40,116
- Come in, Rose will prepare something. - Remember how you eat them?

585
00:28:40,117 --> 00:28:42,222
- I remember. Come on. - I have to go!

586
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:46,762
- Gabe! Gabe, come on! - I have to sell my plums!

587
00:28:46,763 --> 00:28:51,193
I sold some tomatoes, I got $ 0.50. You want to see?

588
00:28:51,194 --> 00:28:53,754
I'll save to buy a new trumpet

589
00:28:53,755 --> 00:28:57,270
to San Pedro can hear me when it's time to open the doors.

590
00:28:58,483 --> 00:29:00,037
Did you hear that?

591
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:03,803
Did you hear that?

592
00:29:03,804 --> 00:29:05,322
Are the hounds of hell.

593
00:29:05,323 --> 00:29:07,131
I have to chase them away from here.

594
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:10,400
Come on, get out of here! Outside!

595
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:12,801
Outside! Outside!

596
00:29:14,082 --> 00:29:16,534
You all members hypocrites,

597
00:29:16,535 --> 00:29:19,017
They are wasting their time.

598
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:21,979
My God calls workers

599
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,002
and you better obey.

600
00:29:24,003 --> 00:29:27,666
Prepare for the Judgment!

601
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:31,232
Prepare for the Judgment!

602
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:34,521
Better prepare yourself for Trial!

603
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:37,865
My God calls the workers.

604
00:29:39,842 --> 00:29:43,288
Prepare for the Judgment!

605
00:29:43,821 --> 00:29:47,568
Prepare for the Judgment!

606
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:50,397
Prepare for the Judgment!

607
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,021
My God calls the workers.

608
00:29:54,022 --> 00:29:57,094
Prepare for the Judgment!

609
00:29:57,827 --> 00:30:01,051
Prepare for the Judgment!

610
00:30:08,871 --> 00:30:10,396
Where is Gabe?

611
00:30:11,107 --> 00:30:12,884
He went somewhere.

612
00:30:15,508 --> 00:30:16,833
He is not eating well.

613
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:18,708
Mrs. Pearl says you can not make something to eat.

614
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:20,277
What do you want me to do, Rose?

615
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:22,930
I have done everything I could for him. I can not make it better.

616
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:26,245
Half of his head exploded. What did you expect?

617
00:30:26,573 --> 00:30:28,809
It should do something to help.

618
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,628
It does not bother anyone.

619
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,429
It was thus only by the metal plate

620
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,614
you have in your head. Has no sense...

621
00:30:35,194 --> 00:30:38,420
It makes no sense to send him to hospital.

622
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:41,496
At least eat well. They can help you take care of itself.

623
00:30:41,497 --> 00:30:44,710
Nobody wants to be caught, Rose. What do you want to lock him up?

624
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:46,638
Man goes out there

625
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:50,577
fighting their war against the Japanese,

626
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:52,675
his head exploded him.

627
00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:56,281
He was given a measly 3,000 and had to make do with that.

628
00:30:56,282 --> 00:30:59,574
- Are you going to come back with that? - It has a metal plate in his head.

629
00:30:59,575 --> 00:31:03,706
It was the only way we had a roof, the metal plate.

630
00:31:03,707 --> 00:31:06,061
It makes no sense to blame yourself for something.

631
00:31:06,062 --> 00:31:08,036
Gabe was not in a position to manage that money.

632
00:31:08,037 --> 00:31:11,186
You did what was best for him. No one can say otherwise.

633
00:31:11,187 --> 00:31:12,822
Look how long it took care of him.

634
00:31:12,823 --> 00:31:15,560
Until wanted to have his own home and move in with Mrs. Pearl.

635
00:31:15,561 --> 00:31:17,845
That's not what I say, woman. Alone...

636
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:22,156
I'm telling you the facts.

637
00:31:22,157 --> 00:31:24,355
If my brother had not had that plate in his head

638
00:31:24,356 --> 00:31:28,836
something which would not urinate or throw a window where.

639
00:31:38,562 --> 00:31:40,280
Where are you going?

640
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:42,126
You're gone from here every Saturday for weeks.

641
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:44,127
I thought you were working on the fence.

642
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:48,365
I'll Taylor's ...

643
00:32:37,318 --> 00:32:38,619
Mom?

644
00:32:39,244 --> 00:32:42,319
Cory, your father almost had something

645
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,962
when you left in the morning without doing your chores.

646
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,367
You're good?

647
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:48,950
He said he was supposed to have you help with the fence.

648
00:32:49,591 --> 00:32:51,300
I said I was going to go to training.

649
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:55,004
He said that in the last 4 or 5 on Saturday and then never does anything.

650
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:56,205
Is going to Taylor's.

651
00:32:57,645 --> 00:33:00,621
- Did you tell the recruiter? - Yes, I said.

652
00:33:00,622 --> 00:33:02,925
- What did he say? - He did not say much.

653
00:33:02,926 --> 00:33:05,641
Go do your homework before you return.

654
00:33:05,642 --> 00:33:08,060
Go clean the stairs,

655
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:11,236
before he gets back, screaming and demanding.

656
00:33:11,237 --> 00:33:12,853
Come on, boy! Go!

657
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:38,859
TROY! You'd like to kill you scare!

658
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,203
How was the game?

659
00:33:40,204 --> 00:33:42,179
Lucille had me on the phone and I could not know how it turned out.

660
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,796
What I care about the game? Come here, woman.

661
00:33:43,797 --> 00:33:46,870
I thought you went to Tayilor's to listen to the game. For, Troy!

662
00:33:46,871 --> 00:33:48,585
You were supposed to fix the fence.

663
00:33:48,586 --> 00:33:51,447
I'll do when I finish with what ...

664
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,522
- With what I have in hand. - Stop, Troy!

665
00:33:54,523 --> 00:33:58,599
- I will not get in your game! - I do and I'll give you a lesson!

666
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,794
TROY, leave me alone!

667
00:34:02,697 --> 00:34:04,980
Where is Cory? That guy and brought her back home?

668
00:34:04,981 --> 00:34:06,393
It is at home doing their homework.

669
00:34:06,394 --> 00:34:07,873
Cory, come here!

670
00:34:08,871 --> 00:34:11,299
- Where are you going? - I'll be right back.

671
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,096
- When? - I'm just going down the street.

672
00:34:14,097 --> 00:34:15,488
Where?

673
00:34:16,357 --> 00:34:17,760
With whom?

674
00:34:20,885 --> 00:34:22,900
TROY, enters the house!

675
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:53,284
- Did you just arrive from the morning? - Yes, I had to train football.

676
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:54,618
- If that? - Yes sir.

677
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:56,648
I got two seconds after you, you can not be.

678
00:34:56,649 --> 00:34:58,368
The trash is full,

679
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:00,974
you have not done your homework, and you come here saying, "Yes."

680
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:02,295
I was preparing to do, Dad.

681
00:35:02,296 --> 00:35:05,951
Your first duty is to help with the fence on Saturday, then another.

682
00:35:05,952 --> 00:35:08,454
Now take that saw and cut the boards.

683
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:13,784
Hey Dad.

684
00:35:13,785 --> 00:35:15,543
Why not buy a TV?

685
00:35:15,544 --> 00:35:17,911
Why do I want a TV? Why do I want one?

686
00:35:17,912 --> 00:35:21,333
Everyone has one. Earl, Barbra, Jesse ...

687
00:35:21,334 --> 00:35:23,584
I did not ask who had one. Did I say what I want?

688
00:35:23,585 --> 00:35:26,989
To se her. They spend a lot on TV. Baseball and all that.

689
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,665
- Yes? - We can see the World Series.

690
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:30,324
How much does a TV?

691
00:35:30,325 --> 00:35:32,869
I do not know, they have one for sale for about $ 200.

692
00:35:33,275 --> 00:35:35,416
- 200 dollars? - Not much, Dad.

693
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:37,176
No, they are only $ 200.

694
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,153
Do you see that roof over your head at night?

695
00:35:41,154 --> 00:35:42,923
Let me tell you something about that roof.

696
00:35:42,924 --> 00:35:47,361
10 years after the last settlement of that ceiling ago.

697
00:35:47,362 --> 00:35:50,740
When winter arrives and snow covers the roof,

698
00:35:50,741 --> 00:35:53,825
it will filter when melted. It will be a little, not much notice.

699
00:35:53,826 --> 00:35:56,502
The next thing you will see is that seep through the house,

700
00:35:56,503 --> 00:36:00,333
the wood will rot by water and will need a new roof.

701
00:36:00,334 --> 00:36:02,706
How much you think it costs to waterproof the roof?

702
00:36:02,707 --> 00:36:07,250
- I dont know. - $ 264 in cash. You see?

703
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:10,474
While you think of a TV, I have to think about the roof.

704
00:36:10,475 --> 00:36:12,326
Or any other problem here.

705
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:15,337
If you had $ 200 what would you do?

706
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:17,257
Do I fix the roof or buy the TV?

707
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,738
Buy the TV.

708
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:21,757
Then when the roof starts to leak, if necessary the arrangement.

709
00:36:21,758 --> 00:36:24,391
Where will you get the money? And you spent it on TV.

710
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:27,876
You'll sit and watch the water all over your new TV.

711
00:36:27,877 --> 00:36:29,508
Dad, you have money. I know you have it.

712
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:31,252
- Where did I have? - In the bank.

713
00:36:31,253 --> 00:36:35,723
Want to see my bank account? Want to see the $ 73.22 that I have there?

714
00:36:35,724 --> 00:36:39,122
You do not have to pay once, you can give something and bring it home.

715
00:36:39,123 --> 00:36:41,966
No, I do not owe anyone anything if I can help.

716
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:45,477
If I miss a payment they come and take him from the house. Then what do you have?

717
00:36:46,827 --> 00:36:49,859
You see? Now when you have the $ 200 free,

718
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,700
then I buy a TV.

719
00:36:51,701 --> 00:36:54,930
Right now, when you have $ 264, I will do to fix the roof.

720
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:55,730
Dad!

721
00:36:55,731 --> 00:36:58,821
Go find your $ 200 and buy a TV if you want.

722
00:36:58,822 --> 00:37:00,469
I have better things to do with my money.

723
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,905
I can not get $ 200. I've never seen $ 200.

724
00:37:02,906 --> 00:37:04,501
I tell you one thing:

725
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:07,650
Get $ 100 and I will complete the other $ 100.

726
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:09,256
Okay, I I'll show you.

727
00:37:09,257 --> 00:37:12,107
You're going to show how you're going to cut the boards.

728
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:14,301
Here you have.

729
00:37:14,302 --> 00:37:16,150
That is worth $ 200.

730
00:37:18,108 --> 00:37:20,391
The Pirates won today.

731
00:37:20,392 --> 00:37:22,877
- There are already five in a row. - I do not think the Pirates,

732
00:37:22,878 --> 00:37:25,455
all are white on that computer. They have that guy ...

733
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:27,267
That Puerto Rican boy, Clement.

734
00:37:27,268 --> 00:37:31,202
Not even play. It could be someone if given a chance.

735
00:37:31,203 --> 00:37:33,279
You get to play one day and sit on the bench to the other.

736
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,668
It has many possibilities to play.

737
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:38,371
I say always play, if regularly to keep fit. That.

738
00:37:38,372 --> 00:37:40,332
They also have targets that do not always play.

739
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:41,941
You can not get them all at the same time.

740
00:37:41,942 --> 00:37:45,951
If you have a white bench, you can bet it's not good.

741
00:37:45,952 --> 00:37:48,558
The black has to be doubly good before entering the team.

742
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:51,380
That's why you do not want moorings to sports.

743
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:53,377
The man is on the team, and what brings them?

744
00:37:53,378 --> 00:37:55,766
They have the black on the computer and do not use it.

745
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:57,191
It's like not having it.

746
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,838
All teams are equal.

747
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:00,845
The Braves have to Hank Aaron and Wes Covington.

748
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:02,801
Hank Aaron took two home runs today, that makes 43 in total.

749
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:05,443
Aaron is nobody. He did what he had to do.

750
00:38:05,444 --> 00:38:08,383
This is how you're supposed to play. It is nothing extraordinary.

751
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:11,872
It is a matter of time, give it when it is. It could give 43 home runs now.

752
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,181
You are not a major league pitch, could not.

753
00:38:13,182 --> 00:38:15,139
We had a best throw in the Negro Leagues.

754
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:18,152
I made seven homers against Satchel Paige. You can not do better.

755
00:38:18,153 --> 00:38:19,767
Sandy Koufax is a leader in strikeouts.

756
00:38:19,768 --> 00:38:21,539
I'm not thinking about Sandy Koufax.

757
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,199
Warren Spahn have already Lew Burdette.

758
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,885
I got tired of this talk.

759
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:30,495
Keep cutting boards.

760
00:38:33,064 --> 00:38:36,593
Your mother told me you recruited a college football team.

761
00:38:36,594 --> 00:38:37,894
驴No?

762
00:38:37,987 --> 00:38:41,436
Yes, the coach Zellman says the recruiter will talk to you.

763
00:38:41,437 --> 00:38:43,406
To permit firm documents.

764
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:46,955
I thought you were going to work in A & P. Are not you going to work after studying?

765
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:48,383
Mr. Stawicki said I will ensure my

766
00:38:48,384 --> 00:38:50,474
since until the season is over.

767
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:53,117
If you start next week I can work weekends.

768
00:38:53,118 --> 00:38:56,135
I thought we had an agreement with all that soccer.

769
00:38:56,136 --> 00:38:59,725
You kept your duties and would work in that position of A & P.

770
00:38:59,726 --> 00:39:02,112
You have not been here all day Saturday,

771
00:39:02,113 --> 00:39:05,196
you have not done any of your homework and now you tell me that will not work.

772
00:39:05,197 --> 00:39:07,313
- I will work on weekends. - Surely yes!

773
00:39:07,314 --> 00:39:10,688
No need to come here to talk to anyone signing anything.

774
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:12,651
Dad, you can not do that. Come from North Carolina.

775
00:39:12,652 --> 00:39:14,782
I do not care where it comes from.

776
00:39:14,783 --> 00:39:16,330
Look, boy.

777
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:20,825
The whites will not let you get anywhere with the ball.

778
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:22,885
Learn from books so you can

779
00:39:22,886 --> 00:39:24,748
work and move up in A & P,

780
00:39:24,749 --> 00:39:27,256
and learn to fix cars, build houses or something.

781
00:39:27,257 --> 00:39:30,252
Find yourself a job, so you have something that nobody can take away from you.

782
00:39:30,637 --> 00:39:32,621
Learn to make good use of your hands

783
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:35,145
in addition to collecting the garbage of others.

784
00:39:35,146 --> 00:39:37,821
I got good grades, Dad. So the recruiter wants to talk to you.

785
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:39,423
You have to have good grades to be recruited.

786
00:39:39,424 --> 00:39:41,326
So I can go to college and have a chance.

787
00:39:41,327 --> 00:39:44,729
First, you have to go there and get your job back.

788
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,738
Mr. Stawicki already hired someone because I said I would play.

789
00:39:48,966 --> 00:39:51,075
You are more idiot than I thought.

790
00:39:51,076 --> 00:39:55,033
You'll let someone take your job so you can play football.

791
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:58,224
Where will you get the money to get out your girlfriend?

792
00:39:58,225 --> 00:40:01,214
What kind of idiocy is that of letting someone takes your job?

793
00:40:01,215 --> 00:40:03,016
- I will work on weekends. - Do not.

794
00:40:03,017 --> 00:40:04,484
Get your ass out of here and find another job.

795
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,851
Come on, Dad. I have to train I can not work and play football.

796
00:40:07,852 --> 00:40:09,339
The team needs me. That's what it says Zellman.

797
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,650
I do not care what he says, I am the boss, you know?

798
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:15,119
I'm the boss here. What I say is what counts.

799
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,511
- Dad ... - I asked you if you understood.

800
00:40:17,512 --> 00:40:19,180
- If that?

801
00:40:20,258 --> 00:40:21,749
Yes sir.

802
00:40:22,733 --> 00:40:24,136
Very good.

803
00:40:24,137 --> 00:40:26,807
You're going to A & P to return you your job.

804
00:40:26,808 --> 00:40:29,449
If you can not do both, then renounces the football team.

805
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,843
You have to accept the straight lines with curves.

806
00:40:31,844 --> 00:40:33,246
Yes sir.

807
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,933
I can ask you a question?

808
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:45,810
What are you going to ask? Mr. Stawicki is who will do that.

809
00:40:46,756 --> 00:40:48,575
Why you never like you you about me?

810
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:50,567
驴Please me?

811
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:53,675
Who says you have to please me?

812
00:40:54,772 --> 00:40:57,255
What is the law that says I have to please you?

813
00:40:57,256 --> 00:41:00,642
You stand on my face and make me such a silly question.

814
00:41:00,643 --> 00:41:03,539
What's that fella someone? Come here when you speak.

815
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,993
Straighten up, dammit.

816
00:41:08,127 --> 00:41:09,959
I asked you a question.

817
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,590
What law says you have to please me?

818
00:41:12,591 --> 00:41:14,322
- Any. - Very good.

819
00:41:14,323 --> 00:41:15,964
You do not eat every day?

820
00:41:16,321 --> 00:41:18,729
He responds when you speak. You do not eat every day?

821
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,000
- Yeah. - Black, while in my home,

822
00:41:21,001 --> 00:41:23,257
- You tell me sir, when you talk to me. - Yes sir.

823
00:41:23,258 --> 00:41:24,558
- Do you eat every day? - Yes sir.

824
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:25,859
- You have a roof. - Yes sir.

825
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,160
- Clothes to wear. - Yes sir.

826
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:28,735
- Why do you think that is? - For you.

827
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,004
Of course I know it is for me.

828
00:41:31,005 --> 00:41:32,995
But why do you think that is?

829
00:41:34,413 --> 00:41:36,003
Why do you like me?

830
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:37,920
If I like you?

831
00:41:38,267 --> 00:41:40,176
I leave here every morning,

832
00:41:40,177 --> 00:41:43,670
I break the back holding white every day.

833
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:45,385
Because I like you?

834
00:41:45,386 --> 00:41:47,468
You're the dumbest I've ever seen.

835
00:41:47,469 --> 00:41:50,488
It's my job, it's my responsibility.

836
00:41:50,489 --> 00:41:53,534
It is assumed that a man must care for his family.

837
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:56,489
You live in my house, I filled my belly with food,

838
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:59,661
sleep in my bed because you're my son.

839
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,162
Not because I agrades it is my duty to take care of you.

840
00:42:03,163 --> 00:42:05,474
I have a responsibility to you.

841
00:42:05,475 --> 00:42:09,389
Let this clear here now before proceeding further.

842
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,036
You do not have to like me.

843
00:42:11,037 --> 00:42:14,057
Mr. Rand does not pay me because I like me.

844
00:42:14,058 --> 00:42:16,282
He pays me because I must.

845
00:42:17,258 --> 00:42:19,390
I have given all I had to give you.

846
00:42:19,391 --> 00:42:21,148
I gave you life!

847
00:42:21,566 --> 00:42:23,456
Your mother and I did,

848
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:26,202
and I would like your black ass was not part of the business.

849
00:42:26,637 --> 00:42:30,477
You do not go for your life worrying about whether someone likes you or not.

850
00:42:30,478 --> 00:42:33,466
Better make sure you respect.

851
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,126
- Understand what I say? - Yes sir.

852
00:42:35,127 --> 00:42:38,799
Then out of my sight and go running to the A & P.

853
00:43:01,931 --> 00:43:04,524
Why not let the guy play football, Troy?

854
00:43:04,525 --> 00:43:06,470
Just try to be like you in sports.

855
00:43:06,471 --> 00:43:08,179
I do not want to be like me.

856
00:43:08,608 --> 00:43:11,596
I want to stay away as much as possible of my life.

857
00:43:11,597 --> 00:43:13,884
You were the only decent thing happened to me, Rose.

858
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,688
I want that for him.

859
00:43:15,689 --> 00:43:18,476
But I do not want any more of my life.

860
00:43:20,073 --> 00:43:24,343
I decided 17 years ago that my son would not get involved in sports.

861
00:43:24,344 --> 00:43:26,105
Not after what they did to me.

862
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:28,616
驴Troy, why not admit you were too old for the majors?

863
00:43:28,617 --> 00:43:29,976
At least once, why not admit it?

864
00:43:29,977 --> 00:43:31,889
What do you mean it was very old?

865
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,700
Was that was not the right color.

866
00:43:33,701 --> 00:43:38,398
I am 53 years and I can do better than .269 of Selkirk right now.

867
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:40,872
How could you play baseball when you were about 40?

868
00:43:40,873 --> 00:43:42,611
Sometimes what you say makes no sense.

869
00:43:42,612 --> 00:43:44,620
Yes I have, woman. I have enough

870
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:46,957
to not let my child be hurt in sports.

871
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,705
You give too dear,

872
00:43:48,706 --> 00:43:51,234
anda so worried if people like him.

873
00:43:51,235 --> 00:43:53,745
Everything that makes the guy, does it for you.

874
00:43:54,276 --> 00:43:57,193
He wants you to say. "Good job, son" That's it.

875
00:43:57,194 --> 00:43:58,861
I do not have time for that, Rose.

876
00:43:58,862 --> 00:44:00,468
It is alive, healthy.

877
00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:03,088
You have to make a living. I did mine.

878
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:06,634
No one will give you hand when out in the world.

879
00:44:06,635 --> 00:44:08,265
Times have changed, Troy.

880
00:44:09,005 --> 00:44:10,683
People change.

881
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:13,784
The world changes and you can not even see it.

882
00:44:19,786 --> 00:44:22,017
Woman, I do the best I can.

883
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:26,962
I come here every Friday. I bring a sack of potatoes and a bucket of lard.

884
00:44:26,963 --> 00:44:29,395
Everyone gets in the door spreading his hands.

885
00:44:30,504 --> 00:44:34,611
I give you all of my bag, I give my sweat and my blood.

886
00:44:34,612 --> 00:44:36,724
I have no tears. The I shed all.

887
00:44:36,725 --> 00:44:39,971
We climbed to fourth night, I am given me by your side

888
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:42,304
and I try to get some sleep.

889
00:44:43,379 --> 00:44:47,320
I get up early on Monday, I find my lunch at the table, I leave

890
00:44:47,321 --> 00:44:50,027
and I seek strength to reach the following Friday.

891
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:53,592
It's all I have, Rose.

892
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:59,201
All that I have to give.

893
00:45:02,861 --> 00:45:05,149
I can not give anything more!

894
00:45:31,453 --> 00:45:33,168
Mr. Maxson.

895
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:37,721
The Commissioner will see you now.

896
00:45:44,589 --> 00:45:46,249
隆Rose!

897
00:45:49,202 --> 00:45:51,093
Hey, Rose!

898
00:45:51,094 --> 00:45:55,080
I Wish I could have seen his face when Mr. Rand told you.

899
00:45:55,081 --> 00:45:58,081
I could not get it out of his mouth, as if he ate her tongue.

900
00:45:58,082 --> 00:46:01,851
When I called the Office of the Commissioner thought he would fire me.

901
00:46:01,852 --> 00:46:04,935
- As everyone. - I did not think you fired.

902
00:46:04,936 --> 00:46:06,918
I thought you would get a warning.

903
00:46:06,919 --> 00:46:08,422
Hey, Rose!

904
00:46:08,423 --> 00:46:10,652
Yes, Mr. Rand likes to bite his tongue.

905
00:46:10,653 --> 00:46:14,158
I saw you running to Taylor's to tell Alberta.

906
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:16,063
Hey, Rose! I told everyone.

907
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,642
Hey, Rose!

908
00:46:17,643 --> 00:46:19,565
I went there to collect my money.

909
00:46:21,477 --> 00:46:25,089
Stop yelling, I know you arrived. What you said there?

910
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,041
You have to come when I call you, woman.

911
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:29,506
Ask Bono. 驴Lucille does not come when you call?

912
00:46:29,507 --> 00:46:32,525
Shut up, I'm not your dog. Do not tell me when I call comes.

913
00:46:32,526 --> 00:46:35,710
Did you hear that, Bono? Had an old dog put arrogant. Was saying:

914
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:37,800
"Come here, Blue!" It was put there and you stare.

915
00:46:37,801 --> 00:46:40,025
He ended by throwing a stick and chased him to bring it.

916
00:46:40,026 --> 00:46:42,114
I'm going to ignore you or your dog.

917
00:46:42,115 --> 00:46:43,571
I remember you used to sing that old song.

918
00:46:43,572 --> 00:46:45,744
Hear! Hear!

919
00:46:45,745 --> 00:46:47,531
He had a dog named Blue.

920
00:46:47,532 --> 00:46:49,348
Nobody wants to hear you sing that old song.

921
00:46:49,944 --> 00:46:51,793
Blue was very loyal.

922
00:46:51,794 --> 00:46:54,137
Cory remember running around here singing that song.

923
00:46:54,138 --> 00:46:55,899
I remember her.

924
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,463
Blue was a good dog.

925
00:46:58,464 --> 00:47:00,903
Blue cornered a possum in a hollow log.

926
00:47:00,904 --> 00:47:03,464
It was a song my father. My father invented.

927
00:47:03,465 --> 00:47:06,169
I do not care who invented it. I do not want to hear you sing.

928
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:08,583
Come here, woman!

929
00:47:08,584 --> 00:47:10,987
Do not give me that. I know you did not fire.

930
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,581
What you said in the Commissioner's Office?

931
00:47:13,582 --> 00:47:16,888
Look, Rose, Mr. Rand called me into his office

932
00:47:16,889 --> 00:47:19,201
after I came back to talk to those people there.

933
00:47:19,202 --> 00:47:21,571
He called me and told me ...

934
00:47:23,115 --> 00:47:25,095
I would chauffeur.

935
00:47:25,096 --> 00:47:26,855
TROY, you're kidding!

936
00:47:26,856 --> 00:47:28,746
Of course not. Ask Bono.

937
00:47:28,747 --> 00:47:30,914
That's great, Troy. Now you do not have to bother anyone else.

938
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:32,603
Damn it...

939
00:47:32,604 --> 00:47:35,908
I did not think I'd see you today. I thought you were a prisoner.

940
00:47:35,909 --> 00:47:38,293
It was on the front page of the Courier the assault on Seefus,

941
00:47:38,294 --> 00:47:40,752
where you you spend with all those lowlifes.

942
00:47:40,753 --> 00:47:42,753
Hey, Dad, that had nothing to to do with me.

943
00:47:42,754 --> 00:47:46,206
I'm not going there to play, I'll be with the band.

944
00:47:46,207 --> 00:47:48,256
I have nothing to do with the gambling.

945
00:47:48,257 --> 00:47:51,441
- They have good music there. - There are rascals there is not.

946
00:47:51,442 --> 00:47:53,794
How you been, Mr. Bond? Hi, Rose.

947
00:47:53,795 --> 00:47:56,543
I saw where you're going to play in Crawford Grill tonight.

948
00:47:56,544 --> 00:47:58,897
Why did not you bring Bonnie as I told you? You should have brought.

949
00:47:58,898 --> 00:48:00,433
He has not been here in a while.

950
00:48:00,434 --> 00:48:02,616
I was just in the neighborhood, I thought I'd stop.

951
00:48:02,617 --> 00:48:05,352
- Here it comes. - Your father was promoted.

952
00:48:05,353 --> 00:48:07,915
It will be the first driver of color.

953
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:10,921
You just have to sit there and read the newspaper as whites.

954
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:13,786
Dad, if you knew how to read you'd be right.

955
00:48:13,787 --> 00:48:17,601
No no. You mean if I knew how to handle would be good.

956
00:48:17,602 --> 00:48:21,017
He has been fighting all driving and even licensed.

957
00:48:21,018 --> 00:48:23,024
Did Mr. Rand knows that you have no license?

958
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,111
Driving is easy, all you do is take the truck

959
00:48:25,112 --> 00:48:27,096
where you want to go. Driving is simple.

960
00:48:27,097 --> 00:48:29,847
You know you have no license? That is what I mean.

961
00:48:29,848 --> 00:48:33,306
I did not ask if it was easy, I asked if Rand knows that you have no license.

962
00:48:33,307 --> 00:48:34,759
He did not have to know about my business.

963
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,159
For when I know, I'll have two or three licenses.

964
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,265
- So, Dad ... - I knew you'd come up with something.

965
00:48:39,266 --> 00:48:42,314
He knew how everything was. The black wants some money.

966
00:48:42,315 --> 00:48:44,515
It's Friday night, is my pay day.

967
00:48:44,516 --> 00:48:48,064
All these criminals are on the street, those who are not imprisoned

968
00:48:48,065 --> 00:48:50,961
Lyons and is desperate to go to join them.

969
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:54,239
You see, Dad. If you gave someone a chance to talk sometimes,

970
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,310
you would see that I was going to return the $ 10 as I promised.

971
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:01,440
Here, I told you I would give when you pay to Bonnie.

972
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:03,756
No, stay with that $ 10 and put them in the bank.

973
00:49:03,757 --> 00:49:07,180
The next time you want to come and ask me for something, you go there and take it.

974
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:11,758
Here are your $ 10, dad. I said it was just rendered.

975
00:49:11,759 --> 00:49:14,676
No, keep them for the next time you want to ask me.

976
00:49:14,677 --> 00:49:17,956
- Dad, take the $ 10. - Troy, let the guy pay you.

977
00:49:21,974 --> 00:49:23,574
Here it is, Rose.

978
00:49:23,575 --> 00:49:26,547
If you do not take it, I'll have to listen for the next 6 months.

979
00:49:26,548 --> 00:49:28,285
You can give me yours too, Troy.

980
00:49:28,286 --> 00:49:29,969
You see, Bono? Did you see how he treats me?

981
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,899
Yes, Lucille treat me the same.

982
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:35,608
It is better to prepare for trial.

983
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:40,420
It is better to ...

984
00:49:40,778 --> 00:49:43,357
Look, the son of Troy!

985
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:45,153
- How you doing, Uncle Gabe? - Lyons!

986
00:49:47,635 --> 00:49:49,762
King of the jungle!

987
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:53,483
Rose, Rose hears. I brought a flower.

988
00:49:53,484 --> 00:49:56,242
I cut myself. It's the same pink as you.

989
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,248
It's very nice of you, Gabe!

990
00:49:58,249 --> 00:49:59,686
What have you been doing, Uncle Gabe?

991
00:49:59,687 --> 00:50:01,909
I've been chasing hounds of hell

992
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:05,105
waiting for the time to tell St. Peter to open the doors.

993
00:50:05,106 --> 00:50:06,743
You've been chasing hounds of hell, right?

994
00:50:06,744 --> 00:50:10,028
Well, you do the right thing. Someone has to chase.

995
00:50:10,029 --> 00:50:11,527
Yes I know.

996
00:50:11,528 --> 00:50:14,623
The devil is strong, not easy prey.

997
00:50:14,624 --> 00:50:17,360
The hounds of hell will bite the heels of all,

998
00:50:17,361 --> 00:50:20,013
but I have my trumpet waiting for Judgment Day.

999
00:50:20,014 --> 00:50:21,713
Waiting for the battle of Armageddon, right?

1000
00:50:21,714 --> 00:50:23,657
It will not be much battle

1001
00:50:23,658 --> 00:50:26,322
when God mushy that sword of judgment.

1002
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:30,413
But it will be difficult for people trying to enter heaven

1003
00:50:30,414 --> 00:50:32,165
if those doors do not open.

1004
00:50:32,166 --> 00:50:33,611
Did you hear that, Dad?

1005
00:50:33,612 --> 00:50:37,076
- Uncle Gabe, you're right. - Lyons ...

1006
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:40,927
King of the jungle!

1007
00:50:40,928 --> 00:50:43,245
Are you going to stay and eat, Gabe? Would you like you put a plate?

1008
00:50:43,246 --> 00:50:46,225
I just eat a sandwich, Rose. I do not want a plate.

1009
00:50:46,226 --> 00:50:48,476
I want to eat with my hands. I want a sandwich.

1010
00:50:48,477 --> 00:50:51,037
What about you, Lyons? You stay? I'm cooking ribs.

1011
00:50:51,038 --> 00:50:53,636
No, I will not eat until we finish playing.

1012
00:50:54,732 --> 00:50:57,022
You owe me a visit for you to see me play, Dad.

1013
00:50:57,023 --> 00:50:59,777
I do not like that Chinese music with all that noise.

1014
00:50:59,778 --> 00:51:02,376
Come in and wash, Gabe. I'll make you a sandwich.

1015
00:51:02,787 --> 00:51:04,657
Troy is angry with me.

1016
00:51:05,751 --> 00:51:07,126
Why are you angry with Gabe?

1017
00:51:07,127 --> 00:51:09,971
Troy thinks is upset because she moved in with Mrs. Pearl.

1018
00:51:09,972 --> 00:51:12,322
I'm not angry with him, you can live anywhere.

1019
00:51:12,323 --> 00:51:14,608
Why did you move there? To Mrs. Pearl does not like anyone.

1020
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:16,347
She does not mind anything, it is pretty good.

1021
00:51:16,348 --> 00:51:17,788
Just will not let all that singing.

1022
00:51:17,789 --> 00:51:20,453
not worried about the rent you pay him, that's what he is not worried.

1023
00:51:20,454 --> 00:51:22,054
Troy, I will not discuss that with you again.

1024
00:51:22,055 --> 00:51:25,121
It was because he wants to have his own house, come and go as you like.

1025
00:51:25,122 --> 00:51:26,654
You can do it here.

1026
00:51:26,655 --> 00:51:28,809
It is not prevented it. He does not put rules.

1027
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:30,645
It is not the same, you know.

1028
00:51:30,646 --> 00:51:32,086
It is the last time I hear that.

1029
00:51:32,087 --> 00:51:34,307
I do not want to hear any more of Gabe and Mrs. Pearl.

1030
00:51:34,308 --> 00:51:36,987
- And next week ... - I'm ready for my sandwich, Rose.

1031
00:51:36,988 --> 00:51:39,176
And the next week when the recruiter coming from school,

1032
00:51:39,177 --> 00:51:42,015
I want to sign that paper and let Cory play soccer.

1033
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,879
It is the last time I want to hear that.

1034
00:51:48,299 --> 00:51:50,297
驴Cory was recruited? What school did you go?

1035
00:51:50,298 --> 00:51:51,903
I'm not thinking about Cory.

1036
00:51:51,904 --> 00:51:54,163
That boy walks around smelling like urine.

1037
00:51:54,164 --> 00:51:57,284
Believes will forbid, no matter what I say.

1038
00:51:58,085 --> 00:51:59,465
Look at this, Bono.

1039
00:51:59,466 --> 00:52:02,027
I left the Office of the Commissioner and went to A & P.

1040
00:52:02,028 --> 00:52:04,306
That boy is not working there. She lied to me.

1041
00:52:04,307 --> 00:52:06,066
He said he got his job back,

1042
00:52:06,067 --> 00:52:07,944
working weekends,

1043
00:52:07,945 --> 00:52:09,430
It is working after leaving school.

1044
00:52:09,431 --> 00:52:11,771
Mr. Stawicki says he has not worked there.

1045
00:52:11,772 --> 00:52:13,095
Cory is growing.

1046
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:15,226
It is only anxious to follow in your footsteps.

1047
00:52:15,227 --> 00:52:16,550
I do not care what you do.

1048
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:18,677
When it reaches the point of wanting to disobey,

1049
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:20,272
it's time to change things.

1050
00:52:20,273 --> 00:52:21,934
Ask Bono.

1051
00:52:21,935 --> 00:52:25,084
I bet you never disobeyed his father without paying the consequences.

1052
00:52:25,754 --> 00:52:27,493
I never had the chance.

1053
00:52:27,912 --> 00:52:31,490
My father moved, but never met him.

1054
00:52:31,491 --> 00:52:34,168
I never knew what he was thinking or where he was going.

1055
00:52:34,169 --> 00:52:36,028
Just it went ...

1056
00:52:36,029 --> 00:52:38,379
Looking for new lands.

1057
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:41,063
So they used to call him old.

1058
00:52:41,064 --> 00:52:42,686
If someone was

1059
00:52:42,687 --> 00:52:44,668
from place to place, from woman to woman,

1060
00:52:44,669 --> 00:52:47,056
we said that "seeking new lands".

1061
00:52:47,057 --> 00:52:49,260
I'll never know if he ever found them.

1062
00:52:49,718 --> 00:52:52,292
When I saw him once, I did not want children.

1063
00:52:52,566 --> 00:52:54,886
I did not know if it would be enough in one place

1064
00:52:54,887 --> 00:52:56,615
to have my children and I be his father.

1065
00:52:56,616 --> 00:52:58,686
I thought I would also "search".

1066
00:52:58,687 --> 00:53:01,436
After all, I've been with Lucille

1067
00:53:01,437 --> 00:53:03,763
almost the same time as your father with Rose.

1068
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,848
And they go 16 years.

1069
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,984
Sometimes I would not have known my father.

1070
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:09,764
I did not want to hear from children.

1071
00:53:09,765 --> 00:53:12,138
A son to him was nothing.

1072
00:53:12,139 --> 00:53:15,222
All I wanted was you learned to walk

1073
00:53:15,223 --> 00:53:17,205
so he could get to work.

1074
00:53:17,206 --> 00:53:19,037
At lunchtime, he ate first.

1075
00:53:19,038 --> 00:53:20,791
If there were leftovers was it touched.

1076
00:53:20,792 --> 00:53:24,248
He sat, ate two chickens and you got the wing.

1077
00:53:24,249 --> 00:53:27,285
Stop that, Dad. Everyone feeds her children.

1078
00:53:27,286 --> 00:53:32,099
No matter how hard it is, everyone does. Sure had something to eat.

1079
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,728
Everything my mind my father

1080
00:53:33,729 --> 00:53:35,728
Fardas cotton was take Mr. Lubin.

1081
00:53:35,729 --> 00:53:37,624
It was the only thing that interested him.

1082
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:40,177
Sometimes I used to wonder because he was still alive.

1083
00:53:40,178 --> 00:53:42,788
I wondered why the devil came and took him.

1084
00:53:42,789 --> 00:53:44,793
"Bring the cotton Fardas Mr. Lubin.

1085
00:53:44,794 --> 00:53:46,196
Find out if you owe money. "

1086
00:53:46,197 --> 00:53:48,500
He must have been when she saw no way out.

1087
00:53:48,501 --> 00:53:49,801
It is what I have done.

1088
00:53:49,802 --> 00:53:52,627
How are you going to go with 11 children? Where you going to go?

1089
00:53:52,628 --> 00:53:54,697
I did not know anything other than work on a farm.

1090
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:57,551
No, he was imprisoned and I think he knew.

1091
00:53:57,552 --> 00:53:59,080
But this I say on my part.

1092
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,461
He felt responsible for us.

1093
00:54:01,462 --> 00:54:03,408
We may try the way he should have,

1094
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:05,248
but without that responsibility,

1095
00:54:05,249 --> 00:54:07,168
he could have gone and have left us ...

1096
00:54:07,169 --> 00:54:08,892
To make your own life.

1097
00:54:08,893 --> 00:54:10,300
Many did.

1098
00:54:10,301 --> 00:54:12,206
At the time of which you speak,

1099
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:17,205
out through the front door, they chose one way or another and leave.

1100
00:54:17,206 --> 00:54:18,812
There, that's what I mean.

1101
00:54:18,813 --> 00:54:21,729
They kept walking until they found something else.

1102
00:54:22,308 --> 00:54:25,433
You never heard anyone "walking empty"?

1103
00:54:25,794 --> 00:54:28,620
This is how you call when you leave that way.

1104
00:54:28,621 --> 00:54:32,175
My father did not have that kind of "Stepped vacuum."

1105
00:54:32,176 --> 00:54:34,313
He stayed with his family,

1106
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:38,459
but it was as cruel as it could be.

1107
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:42,112
My mother could not stand it. I could not stand that evil.

1108
00:54:42,113 --> 00:54:44,745
He ran off when I was about 8 years.

1109
00:54:44,746 --> 00:54:47,066
He escaped one night ...

1110
00:54:47,067 --> 00:54:50,344
I said I would for me. I never saw her again.

1111
00:54:50,345 --> 00:54:54,655
All his wives left him. It was not good for either.

1112
00:54:55,172 --> 00:54:58,994
When it was my time to leave, I was 14.

1113
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:01,715
He was eyeing the daughter of Joe Canewell.

1114
00:55:02,601 --> 00:55:05,242
We had an old mule named Greyboy.

1115
00:55:05,243 --> 00:55:08,269
My father sent me to plow the field ...

1116
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:10,619
And I went to fool around with the daughter of Joe Canewell.

1117
00:55:10,921 --> 00:55:14,512
We found a good place and we got good loving.

1118
00:55:14,513 --> 00:55:17,818
She was 13 years old and were grown as.

1119
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:21,190
There we were, by the stream, enjoying without thinking of anything else.

1120
00:55:21,603 --> 00:55:24,079
We did not see Greyboy had come loose.

1121
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,196
He returned to the house and my father was looking for me.

1122
00:55:27,197 --> 00:55:30,406
We were there when my father came to enjoy.

1123
00:55:31,132 --> 00:55:32,781
We were surprised.

1124
00:55:33,367 --> 00:55:36,011
He took the leather straps to the mule,

1125
00:55:36,012 --> 00:55:39,258
and he began to beat me as if there were no tomorrow.

1126
00:55:39,259 --> 00:55:42,565
I jumped, upset and embarrassed.

1127
00:55:42,566 --> 00:55:44,133
I was afraid of my father.

1128
00:55:44,748 --> 00:55:48,855
When he started hitting me, so naturally I left there running.

1129
00:55:48,856 --> 00:55:51,303
I think I was upset because I did not do my job.

1130
00:55:51,304 --> 00:55:54,294
But I see that I was away

1131
00:55:54,295 --> 00:55:56,436
to stay with the girl himself.

1132
00:55:57,309 --> 00:55:59,715
When I understood what it was all about,

1133
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:04,932
I lost all fear for my father and that's when I became a man.

1134
00:56:04,933 --> 00:56:06,923
At 14 years.

1135
00:56:07,424 --> 00:56:09,431
That was my moment to scare him off to him.

1136
00:56:10,202 --> 00:56:13,598
I took the same belt he had used with me,

1137
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,931
and I began to hit him.

1138
00:56:16,703 --> 00:56:18,831
The girl jumped and ran.

1139
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,162
When my father looked me in the eyes,

1140
00:56:22,163 --> 00:56:24,277
I knew why the devil came to never look.

1141
00:56:24,278 --> 00:56:26,394
Because he was the devil himself.

1142
00:56:27,737 --> 00:56:29,940
I do not know what happened then.

1143
00:56:30,231 --> 00:56:32,177
When I wake up...

1144
00:56:32,178 --> 00:56:37,156
He was lying in the gutter and Blue, his old dog licking my face.

1145
00:56:37,157 --> 00:56:39,951
My eyes were closed so swollen they were.

1146
00:56:40,475 --> 00:56:42,606
I thought I was blind, he saw nothing.

1147
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,236
I was just lying there ...

1148
00:56:44,237 --> 00:56:46,317
I cried.

1149
00:56:51,479 --> 00:56:53,946
I did not know what he would do.

1150
00:56:54,467 --> 00:56:56,591
But I knew ...

1151
00:56:56,592 --> 00:56:59,325
... It was time to leave my father's house.

1152
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:02,562
Suddenly the world grew.

1153
00:57:05,726 --> 00:57:07,955
It was a long time so he could

1154
00:57:07,956 --> 00:57:09,712
understand how it was and manage.

1155
00:57:11,066 --> 00:57:14,281
Part of that process was when

1156
00:57:14,282 --> 00:57:16,474
I had to find a place where I feel in my blood

1157
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,605
and saw that the only thing between us

1158
00:57:18,606 --> 00:57:20,159
They were within a few years.

1159
00:57:23,346 --> 00:57:25,370
What you got there, Uncle Gabe?

1160
00:57:25,699 --> 00:57:29,133
A ham sandwich. Rose made me one of ham.

1161
00:57:31,799 --> 00:57:34,496
I lost touch with everyone except with Gabriel.

1162
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:40,265
But...

1163
00:57:43,756 --> 00:57:45,416
I hope he's dead.

1164
00:57:49,577 --> 00:57:51,785
I hope you have found peace.

1165
00:57:52,558 --> 00:57:54,553
It is a heavy story, Dad.

1166
00:57:55,803 --> 00:57:58,529
I did not know you had left home at age 14.

1167
00:57:59,762 --> 00:58:02,064
At 14 he is too young to be independent.

1168
00:58:02,065 --> 00:58:03,778
I do not know what I would have done.

1169
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:07,858
I got out of that stream and walked to Mobile.

1170
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,535
He was tired of the farm. I thought it would be better in the city.

1171
00:58:10,536 --> 00:58:13,178
So I walked 322 km to Mobile.

1172
00:58:13,179 --> 00:58:15,974
Wait a moment. You not walked 322 km, Dad.

1173
00:58:16,837 --> 00:58:19,259
Nobody walks 322 km!

1174
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,011
What are you talking about?

1175
00:58:21,012 --> 00:58:24,108
It was the only way to move at that time.

1176
00:58:24,109 --> 00:58:26,507
I'd fuck it if you would not take a ride with someone.

1177
00:58:27,446 --> 00:58:30,630
Who you going to take? There were no cars like today.

1178
00:58:30,631 --> 00:58:32,191
We talk about 1918.

1179
00:58:32,192 --> 00:58:33,902
What are you talking about?

1180
00:58:33,903 --> 00:58:36,136
I am telling Lyons how easy it was for him.

1181
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,903
He knew nothing of what I'm talking about.

1182
00:58:37,904 --> 00:58:40,456
Lyons, Bonnie spoke. He said that were supposed to go through it.

1183
00:58:40,457 --> 00:58:41,831
Yes, okay, Rose.

1184
00:58:42,154 --> 00:58:44,659
I walked all the way to Mobile

1185
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,975
and I got together with others who were going in the same direction.

1186
00:58:47,976 --> 00:58:49,826
I got here and found

1187
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:53,036
that not only could not find work, he had nowhere to live.

1188
00:58:53,037 --> 00:58:56,119
I thought it was free.

1189
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,733
The color lived on the banks of the river,

1190
00:58:58,734 --> 00:59:01,078
anywhere that could give them shelter.

1191
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,742
Getting off the Brady Street Bridge.

1192
00:59:03,743 --> 00:59:07,805
They lived in huts made of sticks and tar paper.

1193
00:59:08,124 --> 00:59:12,099
I pulled in there and went from bad to worse. I started stealing.

1194
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:14,411
First it was food. Then I thought:

1195
00:59:14,412 --> 00:59:17,677
"If I steal money, I can buy food and shoes too."

1196
00:59:17,678 --> 00:59:20,426
One thing led to another, I met your mother.

1197
00:59:20,427 --> 00:59:22,727
He was young, eager to become a man.

1198
00:59:23,124 --> 00:59:25,816
I met your mother and I had. Why did I do that?

1199
00:59:25,817 --> 00:59:28,160
Now he had to worry about feed you and her.

1200
00:59:28,161 --> 00:59:29,838
He had to steal three more times.

1201
00:59:30,635 --> 00:59:32,953
One day I went looking for someone to steal ...

1202
00:59:33,724 --> 00:59:35,805
That's what it was, a thief.

1203
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:37,368
I am telling the truth.

1204
00:59:37,369 --> 00:59:39,940
I'm ashamed since that day, but it's true.

1205
00:59:40,596 --> 00:59:43,825
I went to rob someone, I took out my knife and he pulled a gun.

1206
00:59:43,826 --> 00:59:45,446
He shot me in the chest. It felt like

1207
00:59:45,447 --> 00:59:48,045
if someone will beat me a hot iron.

1208
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:51,415
When he shot me, I pounce on it with my knife and ...

1209
00:59:52,936 --> 00:59:54,701
They say I killed him.

1210
00:59:55,028 --> 00:59:58,835
I was locked in the prison for 15 years, there I met Bono.

1211
00:59:58,836 --> 01:00:00,914
It's where I learned to play baseball.

1212
01:00:00,915 --> 01:00:02,529
After I left, your mother

1213
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:04,925
He had gone with you to make a living without me.

1214
01:00:04,926 --> 01:00:07,157
15 years was a long time for her to wait for me.

1215
01:00:07,158 --> 01:00:09,651
But those 15 years cured me of stealing.

1216
01:00:09,652 --> 01:00:10,982
Rose can tell you.

1217
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:12,621
When I met her she asked me

1218
01:00:12,622 --> 01:00:14,983
if he had left all that nonsense.

1219
01:00:14,984 --> 01:00:18,490
I said, "Honey, you and baseball are all that matters to me."

1220
01:00:18,491 --> 01:00:20,205
Did you hear me, Bono? And he meant it.

1221
01:00:20,206 --> 01:00:21,901
She said, "What comes first?"

1222
01:00:21,902 --> 01:00:24,889
I said, "No doubt that's baseball.

1223
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:28,337
But if you stay with me, both live with him. "

1224
01:00:28,338 --> 01:00:29,664
Is not it true, Rose?

1225
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:35,036
- It is true. - Shut up, you did not say anything like that.

1226
01:00:35,037 --> 01:00:37,872
What you said to me was, "Honey, you know you'll always be the # 1 for me."

1227
01:00:37,873 --> 01:00:39,273
That's what you said.

1228
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:41,876
That's why I love this woman!

1229
01:00:41,877 --> 01:00:44,938
Rose keeps you at bay. If you step out of line, she straightens you.

1230
01:00:44,939 --> 01:00:47,723
Lyons, better go for Bonnie. Is waiting for you.

1231
01:00:47,724 --> 01:00:49,410
Hey Dad...

1232
01:00:49,411 --> 01:00:52,038
Why do not you go to the Grill to hear me play?

1233
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:55,396
I will not go there. I'm too old to attend these clubs.

1234
01:00:55,397 --> 01:00:58,425
You have to be very good to play at the Grill.

1235
01:00:58,426 --> 01:01:00,025
Come on, Dad.

1236
01:01:00,026 --> 01:01:02,890
- I have to get up early. - You not stay up late.

1237
01:01:04,378 --> 01:01:08,304
No, I'll eat dinner and go to bed.

1238
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:12,994
Well I have to go. See you later.

1239
01:01:15,923 --> 01:01:18,522
Do not come to my house on my pay.

1240
01:01:18,523 --> 01:01:20,810
Pick up the phone and tell someone you're coming.

1241
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:22,890
And bring Bonnie. You know I always glad to see her.

1242
01:01:22,891 --> 01:01:25,466
I will, Rose. Beware.

1243
01:01:26,427 --> 01:01:28,356
- See you, Dad. - Bye.

1244
01:01:28,357 --> 01:01:29,734
See you, Mr. Bono.

1245
01:01:30,299 --> 01:01:33,445
- See you, Uncle Gabe! - Lyons, the king of the jungle!

1246
01:01:34,603 --> 01:01:37,691
You're already a dinner, woman? You and I have issues to resolve.

1247
01:01:37,692 --> 01:01:39,798
- It will also be atrocious. - Troy, I finished talking to you.

1248
01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:41,974
Woman, here is Bono. Bono is like family.

1249
01:01:41,975 --> 01:01:45,726
I know this black since ... How long have I known you?

1250
01:01:45,727 --> 01:01:47,101
A long time ago.

1251
01:01:47,102 --> 01:01:49,324
I know this black since Skippy was a puppy.

1252
01:01:49,325 --> 01:01:52,715
- We have gone from everything. - You are right.

1253
01:01:52,716 --> 01:01:54,923
I know for longer than you, Rose.

1254
01:01:54,924 --> 01:01:56,838
And we're still together, shoulder to shoulder.

1255
01:01:56,839 --> 01:01:59,966
Bono, a man can not ask for more than that.

1256
01:02:00,301 --> 01:02:02,627
- I love you, black. - Do not!

1257
01:02:02,628 --> 01:02:05,916
I love you too, but I must go home to see my wife.

1258
01:02:05,917 --> 01:02:08,788
Yours have it on hand. I have to find my own.

1259
01:02:10,682 --> 01:02:12,178
Why did you do that, Dad?

1260
01:02:12,179 --> 01:02:14,039
What's going on? 驴Cory, what happens?

1261
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,625
Dad went to school and told the coach

1262
01:02:15,626 --> 01:02:17,125
Zellma I can not play more football.

1263
01:02:17,126 --> 01:02:18,711
I can not even play!

1264
01:02:18,712 --> 01:02:20,321
He told the recruiter not to come.

1265
01:02:20,322 --> 01:02:21,977
- Troy ... - Do not give me that.

1266
01:02:21,978 --> 01:02:23,811
Yes, I do. And the boy knows why I did it.

1267
01:02:23,812 --> 01:02:25,874
Why did you do that? It was the only chance I had!

1268
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,693
- There is nothing wrong with that play. - She lied to me.

1269
01:02:28,694 --> 01:02:30,867
I asked him if he wanted to play football,

1270
01:02:30,868 --> 01:02:33,882
He had to do your homework and keep his job at A & P.

1271
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:35,200
Those were the conditions.

1272
01:02:35,201 --> 01:02:36,723
I stopped to talk to Mr. Stawicki ...

1273
01:02:36,724 --> 01:02:38,924
I can not work after school during the season, Dad!

1274
01:02:39,351 --> 01:02:41,895
I tried to tell you that Mr. Stawicki would keep me work.

1275
01:02:41,896 --> 01:02:44,655
You never want to hear anyone! And now you go and do this to me?

1276
01:02:44,656 --> 01:02:46,345
I do not do anything, did you yourself.

1277
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:48,111
Just because you had no chance!

1278
01:02:48,112 --> 01:02:50,512
You'd scare it better than you, that's all!

1279
01:02:55,245 --> 01:02:57,119
- Come here. - Troy ...

1280
01:02:57,569 --> 01:02:58,998
Troy.

1281
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:06,572
Rec贸gelo.

1282
01:03:15,798 --> 01:03:17,256
Wear it.

1283
01:03:24,975 --> 01:03:26,478
Am谩rratelo.

1284
01:03:32,232 --> 01:03:34,244
Well, do you see?

1285
01:03:35,543 --> 01:03:37,542
You made a mistake.

1286
01:03:37,543 --> 01:03:40,446
- I did not do anything! - I'll tell you what was your error.

1287
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,325
You tried to hit the ball and not give him.

1288
01:03:44,222 --> 01:03:45,835
That was the first strike.

1289
01:03:45,836 --> 01:03:47,602
Now you're in the batter's box.

1290
01:03:48,671 --> 01:03:51,759
You abanicaste and you gave him. Dresses?

1291
01:03:52,602 --> 01:03:54,251
That was the first strike.

1292
01:03:56,783 --> 01:03:59,054
Do not strikeouts.

1293
01:05:32,967 --> 01:05:35,674
Cory, come help clean the closet.

1294
01:05:35,675 --> 01:05:37,434
I will not leave the team.

1295
01:05:37,435 --> 01:05:39,144
I do not care what Dad says.

1296
01:05:39,145 --> 01:05:41,206
I'll talk to him when he returns.

1297
01:05:41,703 --> 01:05:43,426
I had to go see your Uncle Gabe.

1298
01:05:43,427 --> 01:05:46,200
Police arrested him again, and said that for disturbing the peace.

1299
01:05:46,201 --> 01:05:48,179
Come live over here.

1300
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:50,184
Come and help me clean the cabinets.

1301
01:05:50,185 --> 01:05:51,647
Come on.

1302
01:06:02,013 --> 01:06:03,896
驴Troy, what did they say?

1303
01:06:03,897 --> 01:06:05,208
They said nothing.

1304
01:06:05,209 --> 01:06:08,171
I gave them $ 50 and released.

1305
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:09,789
After I tell you.

1306
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:12,936
- Where is Cory? - Helping me with lockers.

1307
01:06:12,937 --> 01:06:14,977
Well, tell him to bring her back here.

1308
01:06:17,276 --> 01:06:18,951
All they want is money.

1309
01:06:18,952 --> 01:06:21,717
And go 6 or 7 times I go there for him.

1310
01:06:21,718 --> 01:06:23,994
I see it coming and are rubbing their hands.

1311
01:06:23,995 --> 01:06:26,937
Yes, I know what you mean, all they care about is money.

1312
01:06:26,938 --> 01:06:29,069
They do not care what is right.

1313
01:06:30,065 --> 01:06:31,790
Negro...

1314
01:06:31,791 --> 01:06:34,898
Why did you buy hardwood?

1315
01:06:34,899 --> 01:06:37,240
You're just going to build a small fence.

1316
01:06:37,241 --> 01:06:39,068
Find something soft pine wood, it is all you need.

1317
01:06:39,069 --> 01:06:41,102
I know what I do. This is wood for outdoor use.

1318
01:06:41,103 --> 01:06:43,298
Pinewood is for inside the house.

1319
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:46,019
The pine interior, this is for outside.

1320
01:06:46,357 --> 01:06:48,281
Now tell me how it will be the fence.

1321
01:06:49,706 --> 01:06:51,848
You do not need this wood.

1322
01:06:51,849 --> 01:06:55,792
You put the pine and will last as long as you live here.

1323
01:06:55,793 --> 01:06:58,760
How do you know how long I'll live, black? I could live forever.

1324
01:06:59,075 --> 01:07:01,674
You could live more than the old Horsely.

1325
01:07:01,675 --> 01:07:03,698
It's what Magee used to say.

1326
01:07:03,699 --> 01:07:06,291
Magee was a fool. Tell me who you heard that

1327
01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:09,266
pull teeth with a pair of rusty pliers.

1328
01:07:09,267 --> 01:07:12,396
The olders. My grandfather used to take off their teeth with pliers.

1329
01:07:12,397 --> 01:07:14,798
There were no dentists for people of color at the time.

1330
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:17,332
You have to clean them, you know? You're clean pliers.

1331
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:18,649
Esterilizarlos.

1332
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:20,470
In addition, we no longer live at that time.

1333
01:07:20,471 --> 01:07:22,804
All I had to do was go to Dr. Goldblum.

1334
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:26,197
I saw you with that girl from Tallahassee, this Alberta.

1335
01:07:26,198 --> 01:07:29,408
- I saw them close together. - What do you mean "together"?

1336
01:07:29,409 --> 01:07:31,849
I see you laughing and joking with her all the time.

1337
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:34,649
I laugh and joke with all, Bono. You know me.

1338
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:37,115
That's not the kind of laughter and jokes of which I speak.

1339
01:07:38,132 --> 01:07:39,645
How you doing, Mr. Bono?

1340
01:07:39,646 --> 01:07:41,834
Cory, saw Bono take and cut some wood.

1341
01:07:41,835 --> 01:07:44,063
He says the wood is very hard to cut.

1342
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:47,261
Begone, Jim. Let the boy show you how it is done.

1343
01:07:47,262 --> 01:07:49,020
Go ahead, do it.

1344
01:07:53,489 --> 01:07:55,316
Check it out.

1345
01:07:55,317 --> 01:07:58,292
Go strong boy, it looks or Joe Louis.

1346
01:07:59,029 --> 01:08:00,525
Gosh, I must be old and,

1347
01:08:00,526 --> 01:08:02,759
by the way the boy cut the wood.

1348
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,379
I do not know why mom wants a fence in the yard.

1349
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:08,124
I do not know either. What you are saving here?

1350
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:10,214
It has nothing to what others want.

1351
01:08:11,594 --> 01:08:13,909
Some build fences to keep people away.

1352
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:16,729
Others, to keep people inside.

1353
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:19,776
Rose wants to keep everyone together. He loves them.

1354
01:08:20,199 --> 01:08:22,958
Black, do not need anyone to tell me that my wife loves me.

1355
01:08:23,319 --> 01:08:26,599
Cory, go and see if you can find another saw.

1356
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,042
Where is?

1357
01:08:28,548 --> 01:08:31,118
I said that shopped. Try to find it.

1358
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,867
What did you mean to keep everyone together?

1359
01:08:51,824 --> 01:08:53,543
Troy...

1360
01:08:54,085 --> 01:08:57,639
I've known for almost a lifetime.

1361
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:01,004
You and Rose. Both I know for some time.

1362
01:09:01,506 --> 01:09:03,900
I remember when you met Rose.

1363
01:09:03,901 --> 01:09:07,116
When you played baseball in the park.

1364
01:09:07,117 --> 01:09:09,609
Many girls were behind you at the time.

1365
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:11,413
You could choose what you wanted.

1366
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:16,031
When you chose Rose, he was happy for you.

1367
01:09:16,344 --> 01:09:19,586
That was the first time I knew you knew what you were doing.

1368
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:23,261
I said, "My friend Troy knows what he's doing.

1369
01:09:23,262 --> 01:09:26,250
I will follow it, it could take me somewhere. "

1370
01:09:26,251 --> 01:09:28,390
I have been following too.

1371
01:09:28,391 --> 01:09:32,609
I've learned a lot of things about seeing life.

1372
01:09:33,638 --> 01:09:36,719
I learned to realize where the trash was.

1373
01:09:37,062 --> 01:09:39,573
How to distinguish garbage alfalfa.

1374
01:09:39,951 --> 01:09:42,248
You taught me many things.

1375
01:09:42,249 --> 01:09:45,689
You taught me to not make the same mistakes.

1376
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:50,113
To accept life as it was, to put one foot behind the other.

1377
01:09:50,772 --> 01:09:53,617
- Rose is a good woman, Troy. - I know it is.

1378
01:09:53,618 --> 01:09:56,823
I've been married to her for 18 years. What are you thinking, Bono?

1379
01:09:56,824 --> 01:10:00,261
I'm just saying it's a good woman, just that.

1380
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:02,841
You say it's a good woman and stop throwing so no more.

1381
01:10:02,842 --> 01:10:04,232
Why do you say it is?

1382
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:07,234
She loves you, Troy. Rose loves you.

1383
01:10:07,235 --> 01:10:09,622
You say you do not deserve me. It's what you try to say.

1384
01:10:09,623 --> 01:10:11,470
I do not deserve it because I'm looking at the other girl.

1385
01:10:11,471 --> 01:10:12,775
I know what you're trying to say.

1386
01:10:12,776 --> 01:10:15,114
I know what Rose means to you, Troy.

1387
01:10:15,115 --> 01:10:18,249
I'm just saying I do not want to see you mess up.

1388
01:10:19,929 --> 01:10:21,302
Yes...

1389
01:10:24,589 --> 01:10:27,941
I thank you, Bono.

1390
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:32,990
If I saw you doing the same with Lucille, I told you the same thing.

1391
01:10:33,378 --> 01:10:35,249
That's all I have to say.

1392
01:10:35,959 --> 01:10:38,259
I said that because I love them both.

1393
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,119
Damn it...

1394
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:45,083
Do you know me. I was not looking for anything.

1395
01:10:45,084 --> 01:10:47,871
You can not find a better wife Rose, I know.

1396
01:10:47,872 --> 01:10:50,015
But this woman ...

1397
01:10:50,016 --> 01:10:52,282
It seems that stuck in my mind and I can not get her off me.

1398
01:10:52,283 --> 01:10:55,838
I tried to fight with that, I tried to get her out but is more in love.

1399
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:58,520
Now he's stuck with me more.

1400
01:10:58,521 --> 01:11:01,652
You have the control. It's what I always say.

1401
01:11:01,653 --> 01:11:03,442
You are responsible for what you do.

1402
01:11:03,443 --> 01:11:05,749
I'm not avoiding my share of responsibility. If it is okay

1403
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:07,734
with my heart, I am calm then.

1404
01:11:07,735 --> 01:11:10,804
Because it's my heart that I always hear, tell me if I'm right or wrong.

1405
01:11:10,805 --> 01:11:13,969
And I do not mean to hurt Rose, I love her.

1406
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:15,853
He has endured all this time,

1407
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:17,451
I love and respect him for that.

1408
01:11:17,452 --> 01:11:20,168
I know you love her, why I do not wanna see you hurting her.

1409
01:11:20,687 --> 01:11:23,768
But what will you do when you discover?

1410
01:11:23,769 --> 01:11:25,872
What will you have then?

1411
01:11:25,873 --> 01:11:29,279
If you try to maneuver the two, sooner or later fall.

1412
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,832
- That's normal. - Yes, I know what you say, Bono.

1413
01:11:32,798 --> 01:11:34,972
I've been trying to find a way to solve it.

1414
01:11:34,973 --> 01:11:36,945
Fix it right, Troy.

1415
01:11:36,946 --> 01:11:40,026
I do not want to put in your affairs,

1416
01:11:40,027 --> 01:11:42,284
but solve it so that everything goes well.

1417
01:11:42,285 --> 01:11:44,517
I always get in yours and Lucille problems.

1418
01:11:44,518 --> 01:11:47,792
When are you going to buy the refrigerator you want that woman?

1419
01:11:47,793 --> 01:11:50,703
Do not tell me you have no money, know what your bank.

1420
01:11:50,704 --> 01:11:54,362
Mellon does not need the money as much as Lucille wants the refrigerator.

1421
01:11:54,363 --> 01:11:55,780
- I'll tell you what to do. - What?

1422
01:11:55,781 --> 01:11:58,169
When you're done to build that close to Rose,

1423
01:11:58,170 --> 01:11:59,593
I'll buy that refrigerator Lucille.

1424
01:11:59,594 --> 01:12:01,968
Already you got engaged!

1425
01:12:03,298 --> 01:12:06,504
- Black Hey, where are you going? - I'm going to the house.

1426
01:12:06,505 --> 01:12:08,464
Do not expect to get help now.

1427
01:12:08,465 --> 01:12:10,274
I'm protecting my money.

1428
01:12:10,275 --> 01:12:13,457
I want to see if you can do that by yourself.

1429
01:12:13,458 --> 01:12:14,934
That's what I see!

1430
01:12:14,935 --> 01:12:17,332
You'll be here six months without my help.

1431
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,688
Black, you're wrong!

1432
01:12:18,689 --> 01:12:20,454
When it comes to my money,

1433
01:12:20,455 --> 01:12:23,678
I am as certain as the fireworks on July 4.

1434
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:25,296
We'll see.

1435
01:12:25,297 --> 01:12:27,276
You can go throwing your passbook.

1436
01:13:18,498 --> 01:13:20,728
What you said there? What happened with Gabe?

1437
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:24,361
I went up there. It cost me $ 50.

1438
01:13:24,362 --> 01:13:25,787
They said he was disturbing the peace.

1439
01:13:25,788 --> 01:13:28,160
The judge ordered a hearing for him in three weeks.

1440
01:13:28,161 --> 01:13:31,013
To see why that should not be admitted again.

1441
01:13:31,014 --> 01:13:32,712
What did you say? What you commented the judge?

1442
01:13:32,713 --> 01:13:34,807
I said I'd take care of him.

1443
01:13:34,808 --> 01:13:36,525
It made no sense to hospitalize again.

1444
01:13:36,526 --> 01:13:38,388
Great greasy extended his palm, he said

1445
01:13:38,389 --> 01:13:40,388
to give him $ 50 and I take him home.

1446
01:13:40,389 --> 01:13:42,518
Where is he now? Where did he go?

1447
01:13:42,519 --> 01:13:44,739
He went out there for himself. No need to shake hands.

1448
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:46,179
I do not know, I think the best

1449
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:48,031
place for him would be put in the hospital.

1450
01:13:48,032 --> 01:13:50,598
I know what you're going to tell me, but what I think is best.

1451
01:13:50,599 --> 01:13:52,433
The man's life was ruined by fighting for what?

1452
01:13:52,434 --> 01:13:53,744
And now they want to put him away.

1453
01:13:53,745 --> 01:13:55,716
To be left free. It does not bother anyone.

1454
01:13:55,717 --> 01:13:59,946
Well, everyone has their own point of view I guess.

1455
01:13:59,947 --> 01:14:01,335
Come to lunch.

1456
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:04,333
I made a plate of beans and corn bread in the oven. Come a little.

1457
01:14:04,334 --> 01:14:05,793
It makes no sense that you worry so Gabe.

1458
01:14:05,794 --> 01:14:08,722
- Rose, I have something to tell you. - Expected to be the table.

1459
01:14:08,723 --> 01:14:10,116
Rose...

1460
01:14:10,602 --> 01:14:14,089
I do not know how to say this.

1461
01:14:17,348 --> 01:14:19,262
I have not explain it.

1462
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:22,571
It was something that grew ...

1463
01:14:23,736 --> 01:14:28,509
It started as a small bush and then became a forest.

1464
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:31,008
- Troy, what you mean? - Let me talk, woman.

1465
01:14:31,009 --> 01:14:33,430
I'm trying to tell you ...

1466
01:14:33,431 --> 01:14:35,347
Trying to find a way to tell you ...

1467
01:14:40,865 --> 01:14:42,830
I will be a father.

1468
01:14:45,343 --> 01:14:47,671
I will be someone's father.

1469
01:14:52,281 --> 01:14:55,070
驴Troy, you're telling me you're going to be what?

1470
01:14:55,071 --> 01:14:58,983
- Are you going to be someone's father? - Rose ... now ...

1471
01:14:58,984 --> 01:15:01,158
Hey, Troy! Hey, Rose!

1472
01:15:01,159 --> 01:15:03,922
I have to wait 18 years to hear something.

1473
01:15:03,923 --> 01:15:05,345
Hi, Rose.

1474
01:15:07,067 --> 01:15:09,285
I have a flower for you.

1475
01:15:11,855 --> 01:15:15,569
It is a rose. A single rose like you.

1476
01:15:20,794 --> 01:15:22,296
Thank you, Gabe.

1477
01:15:22,297 --> 01:15:23,716
Troy, you're not upset with me, right?

1478
01:15:23,717 --> 01:15:25,593
Those bad men came and took me.

1479
01:15:25,594 --> 01:15:27,700
- You're not upset, right? - I'm not.

1480
01:15:27,701 --> 01:15:29,603
18 and salts me with this.

1481
01:15:29,604 --> 01:15:32,357
Did you see what I have? I have a new currency.

1482
01:15:35,094 --> 01:15:37,292
- Rose was just ... - There's nothing to say, Troy.

1483
01:15:37,293 --> 01:15:38,592
There is no way to explain that.

1484
01:15:38,593 --> 01:15:41,723
The man who gave me the coin had plenty.

1485
01:15:41,724 --> 01:15:44,153
I will keep this currency until it ceases to shine.

1486
01:15:44,154 --> 01:15:47,922
Gabe, come. I watermelon in the refrigerator, I'll give you a piece.

1487
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:50,617
Rose, you know I was chasing hounds of hell

1488
01:15:50,618 --> 01:15:53,580
and we came and took me evil.

1489
01:15:53,581 --> 01:15:56,003
Troy helped me. He was there to tell

1490
01:15:56,004 --> 01:15:59,022
better let me go before to give them a beating.

1491
01:15:59,023 --> 01:16:01,504
- Yes, he did. - Go inside, Gabe.

1492
01:16:01,505 --> 01:16:04,209
I'll give watermelon. Evil men are gone.

1493
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:08,752
Well, Rose will give me some watermelon. From having stripes.

1494
01:16:14,181 --> 01:16:15,900
Why, Troy?

1495
01:16:17,629 --> 01:16:19,061
Why?

1496
01:16:19,062 --> 01:16:21,561
After all these years you come ...

1497
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,640
to bring me this now.

1498
01:16:24,641 --> 01:16:26,533
It makes no sense at your age.

1499
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:31,299
I could have expected this 10 or 15 years ago, but not now.

1500
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,580
Age has nothing to do, Rose.

1501
01:16:37,585 --> 01:16:40,688
I have tried to be everything a wife should be.

1502
01:16:42,462 --> 01:16:45,902
All that a wife can be. Married for 18 years.

1503
01:16:45,903 --> 01:16:49,809
And I have to live to see the day that you say you're with another woman.

1504
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:52,390
And you have a son of her.

1505
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:08,779
You know I never wanted my family anything halfway.

1506
01:17:11,931 --> 01:17:15,477
My whole family is like that. All parents and different mothers.

1507
01:17:15,478 --> 01:17:17,721
My two sisters and my brother.

1508
01:17:17,722 --> 01:17:20,588
Just I know who is who. I never sat down with my parents.

1509
01:17:20,589 --> 01:17:23,053
It was always your dad and your mom and dad and my mom.

1510
01:17:23,054 --> 01:17:25,991
I never wanted that to any of my children.

1511
01:17:25,992 --> 01:17:28,422
And now you come and tell me something?

1512
01:17:28,423 --> 01:17:30,525
Basta, you should know. It was time.

1513
01:17:30,526 --> 01:17:32,736
Well, I do not know, dammit!

1514
01:17:52,009 --> 01:17:53,645
Rose...

1515
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:59,029
I can not make it go away. It is done.

1516
01:17:59,648 --> 01:18:04,053
I can not do circumstances change.

1517
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:05,962
Nor want.

1518
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:08,564
Maybe you want me and my son get going.

1519
01:18:08,565 --> 01:18:12,330
Maybe that's what you want? Well, you can not kick us out.

1520
01:18:12,331 --> 01:18:14,787
I spent 18 years of my life in you,

1521
01:18:14,788 --> 01:18:16,465
You should have stayed upstairs in my bed, where you belong.

1522
01:18:16,466 --> 01:18:18,874
Listen to me now, we can solve this.

1523
01:18:19,210 --> 01:18:21,268
We can talk, reach an agreement.

1524
01:18:21,269 --> 01:18:22,607
Suddenly he is "us".

1525
01:18:22,608 --> 01:18:25,576
Where was the "we" when you sleeping with that woman?

1526
01:18:25,577 --> 01:18:28,577
"We" had to reach an agreement before look like an idiot.

1527
01:18:28,578 --> 01:18:31,080
You arrive a day late and short of money for a deal with you.

1528
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:33,222
Rose, is that ...

1529
01:18:34,531 --> 01:18:36,922
She gives me a different idea.

1530
01:18:37,407 --> 01:18:40,858
A different understanding of myself.

1531
01:18:40,859 --> 01:18:42,529
I can leave this house

1532
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:45,160
and away from the pressures and problems.

1533
01:18:45,161 --> 01:18:48,782
Being a different man. I have to think about the roof or accounts.

1534
01:18:48,783 --> 01:18:50,835
I just could ...

1535
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:55,364
Being a part of me that had never been.

1536
01:18:56,424 --> 01:18:58,559
What I want to know is:

1537
01:19:00,826 --> 01:19:02,783
I want to know it...

1538
01:19:03,393 --> 01:19:06,171
Do you plan to continue watching?

1539
01:19:06,488 --> 01:19:08,534
That's all you can tell me.

1540
01:19:09,547 --> 01:19:13,272
I can sit at home and laughing. Understand what I say?

1541
01:19:13,776 --> 01:19:16,969
I can laugh out loud and feel good.

1542
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:20,415
I travels through the body to the toes. Rose ...

1543
01:19:22,605 --> 01:19:24,899
I can not give that up.

1544
01:19:31,372 --> 01:19:34,001
Maybe you should go to stay with her,

1545
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:35,561
It is better woman than me.

1546
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:38,675
It's not about who is better. Rose, you're not to blame.

1547
01:19:38,676 --> 01:19:40,811
A man can not ask for better wife than you.

1548
01:19:40,812 --> 01:19:42,656
I am responsible for that.

1549
01:19:42,657 --> 01:19:44,150
I got both routine

1550
01:19:44,151 --> 01:19:46,508
take care of you, I forgot me.

1551
01:19:46,509 --> 01:19:49,415
And why he was there? That was my job, not someone else.

1552
01:19:49,416 --> 01:19:52,565
Rose, listen. I have tried all my life to live decently.

1553
01:19:52,566 --> 01:19:56,041
Have a clean ... hard and life.

1554
01:19:56,042 --> 01:19:58,840
I tried to be a good husband to you, in every way I know.

1555
01:19:59,317 --> 01:20:01,366
Maybe I was born upside down, I do not know.

1556
01:20:01,367 --> 01:20:04,515
But you were born with two strikes before going to the batting cage.

1557
01:20:04,516 --> 01:20:08,764
You have to be careful, attentive to the curve at the corner inside.

1558
01:20:08,765 --> 01:20:12,000
You can not let you mark that no strike or ball pass.

1559
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:14,074
If you go to poncharte you should be trying to hit the ball.

1560
01:20:14,075 --> 01:20:16,947
Everything is against you!

1561
01:20:18,047 --> 01:20:19,743
What will you do?

1562
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:22,775
The cheated, Rose.

1563
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:24,419
I failed.

1564
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:27,810
When I found you and Cory and decent work part-time,

1565
01:20:27,811 --> 01:20:29,811
he was sure. Nothing could touch me.

1566
01:20:30,727 --> 01:20:33,765
No one would make me a strike. Not return to the penitentiary.

1567
01:20:33,766 --> 01:20:36,247
I would not be on the street with a bottle of wine.

1568
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:38,782
He was sure, had a family.

1569
01:20:38,783 --> 01:20:40,691
A job...

1570
01:20:41,496 --> 01:20:44,167
They would not mark me that last strike.

1571
01:20:45,934 --> 01:20:48,870
He was at first base,

1572
01:20:48,871 --> 01:20:50,587
He is hoping that one of the boys take me

1573
01:20:50,588 --> 01:20:52,859
- To get to the home. - You should have stayed in bed.

1574
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:54,483
I saw the girl and she gave me the strength.

1575
01:20:54,484 --> 01:20:57,181
I started thinking that if I tried, perhaps

1576
01:20:57,182 --> 01:20:59,198
I could steal second base. Understand what I say?

1577
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:01,498
You should have withheld, you should have done.

1578
01:21:01,499 --> 01:21:04,606
I was 18 at first base and thought, "Damn, I will."

1579
01:21:04,607 --> 01:21:07,087
We're not talking about baseball!

1580
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:11,019
We are told that you were sleeping with another and were coming home with me.

1581
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:14,569
- It's that, not baseball! - Rose, you're not hearing me.

1582
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:17,625
I'm trying to explain it the best way I know.

1583
01:21:18,897 --> 01:21:20,534
It is not easy for me to admit

1584
01:21:20,535 --> 01:21:23,506
I've been in the same place for 18 years!

1585
01:21:23,507 --> 01:21:25,511
I've been with you!

1586
01:21:26,072 --> 01:21:28,226
I was here with you, Troy!

1587
01:21:28,227 --> 01:21:30,148
Also I have life!

1588
01:21:30,149 --> 01:21:34,211
I Say 18 years of my life to be in place pampering you!

1589
01:21:34,578 --> 01:21:36,830
Do not you think I wanted other things?

1590
01:21:36,831 --> 01:21:38,689
Do not you think I had dreams and hopes?

1591
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:40,901
What about my life? What about me?

1592
01:21:41,502 --> 01:21:44,242
Do not you think went through my head meet other men?

1593
01:21:44,243 --> 01:21:46,833
What I wanted to stay elsewhere

1594
01:21:46,834 --> 01:21:48,593
and forget about my responsibilities?

1595
01:21:48,594 --> 01:21:52,253
Did someone to make me laugh to feel good?

1596
01:21:52,254 --> 01:21:54,611
You're not the only one who has desires and needs.

1597
01:21:54,612 --> 01:21:56,314
But I kept you, Troy.

1598
01:21:56,315 --> 01:21:59,231
I took all my feelings, my desires,

1599
01:21:59,232 --> 01:22:02,892
needs, dreams and buried all within you.

1600
01:22:02,893 --> 01:22:05,225
I planted a seed and took care of her and prayed for her.

1601
01:22:05,226 --> 01:22:08,206
I stood inside you and waited for it to flourish.

1602
01:22:08,207 --> 01:22:09,916
And it did not take me 18 years to realize

1603
01:22:09,917 --> 01:22:13,915
the ground was hard and rocky and it would never flourish.

1604
01:22:13,916 --> 01:22:15,805
But I kept you, Troy.

1605
01:22:15,806 --> 01:22:17,376
I held her tightly.

1606
01:22:17,377 --> 01:22:18,951
You were my husband.

1607
01:22:18,952 --> 01:22:22,125
I owed everything he had.

1608
01:22:22,126 --> 01:22:24,461
Every part of me that I could give.

1609
01:22:24,662 --> 01:22:28,180
And upstairs in that room, with the enveloping darkness ...

1610
01:22:28,481 --> 01:22:33,165
I gave everything I had to try to clear the doubt

1611
01:22:33,166 --> 01:22:35,859
that you were not the best man in the world.

1612
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:38,351
And that wherever you were, I would be there with you.

1613
01:22:38,352 --> 01:22:40,582
Because you were my husband!

1614
01:22:41,995 --> 01:22:45,776
Because it was the only way to survive as your wife.

1615
01:22:46,407 --> 01:22:50,517
Whenever you talk about what you have and what you do not have to give.

1616
01:22:51,006 --> 01:22:52,920
But you also take Troy.

1617
01:22:52,921 --> 01:22:55,546
Tomas and not even know who gives.

1618
01:22:55,547 --> 01:22:57,025
- You say you do not give? - Troy.

1619
01:22:57,026 --> 01:22:59,328
- You say you do not give? - You are hurting me!

1620
01:22:59,329 --> 01:23:01,208
- I give everything I have! - Troy!

1621
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:04,229
- Do not tell me I'm lying! - Troy, you're hurting me!

1622
01:23:04,806 --> 01:23:06,256
隆Troy! 隆Troy!

1623
01:23:06,257 --> 01:23:07,869
Very good.

1624
01:23:08,607 --> 01:23:10,300
It is the second strike.

1625
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:13,172
Stay away from me, boy!

1626
01:23:13,812 --> 01:23:15,620
Do not strikeouts!

1627
01:23:16,921 --> 01:23:19,080
You live with the complete account!

1628
01:23:22,369 --> 01:23:24,337
Do not strikeouts!

1629
01:25:46,728 --> 01:25:50,715
MOTHER

1630
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:46,777
Troy, I want to talk to you.

1631
01:26:49,085 --> 01:26:50,699
So suddenly?

1632
01:26:52,984 --> 01:26:55,827
After all this time you talk to me?

1633
01:26:57,181 --> 01:27:00,019
You have not spoken to me in months. You do not want to talk about last night.

1634
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:01,734
You did not want anything from me since.

1635
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:04,054
What do you want to talk now?

1636
01:27:07,568 --> 01:27:10,690
- Tomorrow is Friday. - I know what day is tomorrow.

1637
01:27:10,691 --> 01:27:12,245
Do you think I know it's Friday morning?

1638
01:27:12,246 --> 01:27:14,340
In all my life I've done nothing but wait on Friday.

1639
01:27:14,341 --> 01:27:15,672
No need to tell me.

1640
01:27:15,673 --> 01:27:17,491
I want to know if you are coming home.

1641
01:27:17,492 --> 01:27:21,229
Whenever I come home, Rose. You know. There was one night that was not.

1642
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:23,337
That's not what I mean and you know it.

1643
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:26,007
I want to know if you're going straight from work.

1644
01:27:26,691 --> 01:27:29,121
I thought I cash my check,

1645
01:27:29,122 --> 01:27:31,403
Taylor's go with the guys, maybe play a game of checkers.

1646
01:27:31,404 --> 01:27:33,785
Troy, I can not live like this. I will not live like this.

1647
01:27:33,786 --> 01:27:35,655
You're living on borrowed time with me.

1648
01:27:35,656 --> 01:27:37,623
6 months and even going to the house makes.

1649
01:27:37,624 --> 01:27:39,777
I'm home every night, every night of the year.

1650
01:27:39,778 --> 01:27:42,131
They are 365 days.

1651
01:27:43,453 --> 01:27:46,214
I want you to go home tomorrow after work.

1652
01:27:50,929 --> 01:27:53,848
Rose, do not play with my salary. You know that already.

1653
01:27:54,889 --> 01:27:57,075
I take my pay and I give it.

1654
01:27:57,076 --> 01:27:59,509
I have no more money than me back.

1655
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:03,555
I just want a little time for me.

1656
01:28:03,556 --> 01:28:04,918
A little time to enjoy life.

1657
01:28:04,919 --> 01:28:06,848
What about me? When is my time to enjoy life?

1658
01:28:06,849 --> 01:28:09,011
I do not know what to tell you, Rose. I do the best I can.

1659
01:28:09,012 --> 01:28:10,477
You have not been going to the home from work

1660
01:28:10,478 --> 01:28:13,410
but you have that the best time to change you and go and name?

1661
01:28:14,808 --> 01:28:18,231
I go to the hospital to see Alberta.

1662
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:23,465
She was admitted this evening, looks like it may already have the baby.

1663
01:28:25,202 --> 01:28:27,128
I will not delay.

1664
01:28:33,867 --> 01:28:36,391
You know, they went home of Mrs. Pearl and took Gabe today.

1665
01:28:36,392 --> 01:28:38,563
They said that you told them to go to lock him.

1666
01:28:40,194 --> 01:28:43,452
I never said that, who told you that lie.

1667
01:28:44,144 --> 01:28:46,353
Pearl but did not tell a lie.

1668
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:48,180
She did not have to tell me. I read in the papers.

1669
01:28:48,181 --> 01:28:50,404
- What did he say? - He said you told them to go.

1670
01:28:50,405 --> 01:28:54,089
They were wrong, as usual. I do not care what they put.

1671
01:28:54,090 --> 01:28:55,778
He said that the government sends part of your check

1672
01:28:55,779 --> 01:28:57,487
the hospital and the other to you.

1673
01:28:57,488 --> 01:28:59,927
I have nothing to do with it if it works. I did not invent the rules.

1674
01:28:59,928 --> 01:29:01,603
As with Gabe did with Cory.

1675
01:29:01,604 --> 01:29:04,526
You did not sign the paper to Cory, but for Gabe. You signed that paper.

1676
01:29:04,527 --> 01:29:06,700
I told you I did not sign anything, woman!

1677
01:29:06,701 --> 01:29:08,322
All I signed was the release paper.

1678
01:29:08,323 --> 01:29:10,771
Hell, I can not read. I do not know what was in that role.

1679
01:29:10,772 --> 01:29:12,503
I did not sign anything about interning Gabe.

1680
01:29:12,504 --> 01:29:15,062
I said being sent to the hospital, you said you were free.

1681
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:17,704
Now you were there and you put it to the hospital for half his money.

1682
01:29:17,705 --> 01:29:19,997
Retractaste you, Troy. You'll have to answer for it.

1683
01:29:19,998 --> 01:29:21,721
I see you've been talking to Mrs. Pearl.

1684
01:29:21,722 --> 01:29:24,182
She's upset because it does not receive money from Gabe income.

1685
01:29:24,183 --> 01:29:26,773
- Troy, I saw you signing! - Do not you see that sign anything!

1686
01:29:26,774 --> 01:29:29,501
To the end, why she has documents my brother?

1687
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:34,855
Mrs. Pearl is telling a lie. And I'll tell you too.

1688
01:29:41,052 --> 01:29:43,262
Do not you see that sign anything!

1689
01:29:44,265 --> 01:29:45,628
What do you say?

1690
01:29:47,317 --> 01:29:49,666
Do not you see that sign anything!

1691
01:31:46,326 --> 01:31:47,885
Troy.

1692
01:31:50,138 --> 01:31:51,724
Troy...

1693
01:31:56,873 --> 01:31:59,899
It was the hospital. Alberta had the baby.

1694
01:32:00,930 --> 01:32:03,893
What was it he had?

1695
01:32:04,938 --> 01:32:06,621
It's a girl.

1696
01:32:13,723 --> 01:32:16,211
I better go see it.

1697
01:32:17,930 --> 01:32:19,441
Troy...

1698
01:32:19,442 --> 01:32:21,690
I have to go see it, Rose. It is right.

1699
01:32:27,003 --> 01:32:28,579
What is the problem?

1700
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:30,350
The baby is fine, right?

1701
01:32:33,431 --> 01:32:36,449
Alberta died during childbirth.

1702
01:32:37,927 --> 01:32:40,013
Died? You say she's dead?

1703
01:32:42,986 --> 01:32:44,845
驴Alberta is dead?

1704
01:32:45,246 --> 01:32:47,567
They said they had done everything they could.

1705
01:32:49,202 --> 01:32:51,325
There was nothing they could do for her.

1706
01:33:21,442 --> 01:33:24,873
And the baby, how are you?

1707
01:33:26,204 --> 01:33:28,434
They say it is healthy.

1708
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:32,361
I wonder who's going to bury.

1709
01:33:32,362 --> 01:33:35,263
He had family, Rose. He did not live alone in the world.

1710
01:33:35,264 --> 01:33:37,570
I know I did not live alone in the world.

1711
01:33:37,571 --> 01:33:40,429
- Are you going to ask if you had insurance? - Troy, I do not talk like that.

1712
01:33:40,430 --> 01:33:42,670
The first thing out of your mouth was, "Who's going to bury?"

1713
01:33:42,671 --> 01:33:44,257
As if to do that alone.

1714
01:33:44,258 --> 01:33:46,231
I'm your wife, not me stay away.

1715
01:33:46,232 --> 01:33:48,778
I'm not alienating anyone. Just give me some space.

1716
01:33:48,779 --> 01:33:50,779
Give me room to breathe.

1717
01:34:21,421 --> 01:34:23,349
Well, Mrs. Death.

1718
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:30,485
I'll tell you what I'll do.

1719
01:34:31,657 --> 01:34:33,802
I'll take and ...

1720
01:34:34,146 --> 01:34:37,959
Build a fence around the yard.

1721
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:43,192
I will build a fence around what belongs to me

1722
01:34:43,193 --> 01:34:46,674
and then I want you to stay on the other side.

1723
01:34:46,675 --> 01:34:48,535
You will stay there until you're ready to take me.

1724
01:34:48,536 --> 01:34:49,836
Then you will come.

1725
01:34:51,963 --> 01:34:55,802
Bring your army, bring your sickle. Bring your clothes struggle.

1726
01:34:55,803 --> 01:34:58,419
This time I will not let our guard down.

1727
01:34:58,420 --> 01:34:59,855
Are not you going to...

1728
01:35:02,546 --> 01:35:04,902
You're not going to sneak in my life.

1729
01:35:07,558 --> 01:35:09,109
When you're ready to take,

1730
01:35:09,110 --> 01:35:11,702
when at the top of your list is Troy Maxson ...

1731
01:35:11,703 --> 01:35:13,725
You come and touch the front door.

1732
01:35:13,726 --> 01:35:15,932
No one else has to get involved in this.

1733
01:35:15,933 --> 01:35:17,347
This is between you and me!

1734
01:35:20,212 --> 01:35:21,997
From man to man!

1735
01:35:27,564 --> 01:35:31,471
You'll stay on the other side of the fence until it's my time!

1736
01:35:33,482 --> 01:35:36,081
Then you are coming to touch the front door!

1737
01:35:36,082 --> 01:35:39,919
To the time you want!

1738
01:35:51,846 --> 01:35:53,765
I will be waiting.

1739
01:36:17,006 --> 01:36:19,211
Thank you very much, enjoy it all.

1740
01:36:19,212 --> 01:36:23,015
Go up to bat with an average of .249, the right ...

1741
01:36:23,768 --> 01:36:28,735
Arty lo poncha...

1742
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:44,771
Rose.

1743
01:36:46,151 --> 01:36:49,094
I'm here with my daughter in her arms.

1744
01:36:49,704 --> 01:36:51,126
Y...

1745
01:36:51,793 --> 01:36:53,328
She's just ...

1746
01:36:53,329 --> 01:36:57,375
It's just a little thing.

1747
01:36:57,376 --> 01:36:59,452
He does not know anything about adult issues.

1748
01:37:00,082 --> 01:37:01,548
He is innocent.

1749
01:37:03,838 --> 01:37:05,701
He has no mom.

1750
01:37:07,699 --> 01:37:09,765
What are you telling me, Troy?

1751
01:37:23,353 --> 01:37:24,825
Good...

1752
01:37:26,570 --> 01:37:29,079
I guess I'll go sit outside on the porch.

1753
01:37:47,379 --> 01:37:49,783
A man has to do what he thinks is right.

1754
01:37:52,788 --> 01:37:55,059
I do not regret anything I've done.

1755
01:37:56,648 --> 01:37:59,514
I feel good in my heart.

1756
01:38:01,979 --> 01:38:03,747
What are you laughing?

1757
01:38:07,711 --> 01:38:10,568
Your father is a great man.

1758
01:38:12,594 --> 01:38:14,738
He has a manotas.

1759
01:38:15,734 --> 01:38:17,826
But sometimes afraid.

1760
01:38:18,403 --> 01:38:21,028
And now your father is afraid,

1761
01:38:21,029 --> 01:38:25,576
because we're sitting here and I have no home.

1762
01:38:26,592 --> 01:38:30,616
I've been homeless before and did not have a baby with me

1763
01:38:30,617 --> 01:38:33,334
but I've been homeless.

1764
01:38:34,289 --> 01:38:37,288
Out on the road, just ...

1765
01:38:39,104 --> 01:38:43,404
She saw one of the trains come and sung:

1766
01:38:43,405 --> 01:38:48,665
Please, sir engineer, let me get on the train.

1767
01:38:51,666 --> 01:38:56,755
Please, sir engineer, let me get on the train.

1768
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:03,878
I have no ticket

1769
01:39:03,879 --> 01:39:08,133
please, let me get on without paying.

1770
01:39:13,552 --> 01:39:15,763
Is my daughter, Rose.

1771
01:39:17,570 --> 01:39:20,558
Blood of my Blood. I can not deny,

1772
01:39:21,516 --> 01:39:23,900
and I do not deny the boys.

1773
01:39:25,784 --> 01:39:28,242
You and they are my family.

1774
01:39:29,307 --> 01:39:32,577
You and this girl

1775
01:39:32,578 --> 01:39:34,393
They are all I have in the world.

1776
01:39:36,608 --> 01:39:38,985
I guess what I'm saying is ...

1777
01:39:43,513 --> 01:39:45,980
I would appreciate

1778
01:39:47,325 --> 01:39:49,780
if you could help me take care of it.

1779
01:40:01,363 --> 01:40:03,228
Okay, Troy.

1780
01:40:05,176 --> 01:40:06,796
You're right.

1781
01:40:09,065 --> 01:40:11,487
I will take care of your baby for you.

1782
01:40:12,701 --> 01:40:14,747
Because as you said, it ...

1783
01:40:17,012 --> 01:40:18,746
He is innocent.

1784
01:40:19,933 --> 01:40:23,603
And you can not pass the sins of the father to the son.

1785
01:40:26,226 --> 01:40:29,062
A motherless child has a difficult life.

1786
01:40:51,598 --> 01:40:54,709
From now on, this girl has a mother.

1787
01:41:01,144 --> 01:41:03,923
But you do not have a wife.

1788
01:42:13,772 --> 01:42:15,541
I walk in and everyone leaves.

1789
01:42:15,542 --> 01:42:18,149
I'll take this cake to the church for the bake sale.

1790
01:42:18,150 --> 01:42:21,147
Lyons went to see you. We came to pay the $ 20.

1791
01:42:21,148 --> 01:42:23,382
- They are here at the table. - Here's the money.

1792
01:42:23,383 --> 01:42:25,508
Leave it on the table, Troy. Then I pick up.

1793
01:42:25,509 --> 01:42:26,958
At what time you come back?

1794
01:42:26,959 --> 01:42:29,386
It makes no sense to ask me, no matter what time you return.

1795
01:42:29,387 --> 01:42:31,587
I just asked you a question, woman. I can not ask you something?

1796
01:42:31,588 --> 01:42:34,149
Troy, I do not want to talk about it. Your food is on the stove.

1797
01:42:34,150 --> 01:42:38,200
Just heat it and do not eat cakes there.

1798
01:42:38,201 --> 01:42:41,299
I will return to look for them, tomorrow we sale in the church.

1799
01:43:39,399 --> 01:43:42,237
- Hi, Troy. - How are you, Bono?

1800
01:43:42,238 --> 01:43:45,075
I thought about moving to see you.

1801
01:43:45,076 --> 01:43:47,325
There was no one in the house, so I thought ...

1802
01:43:47,326 --> 01:43:50,869
Why you came to see me? You do not go through the house a month ago.

1803
01:43:51,457 --> 01:43:53,604
I owe you money or something.

1804
01:43:53,605 --> 01:43:56,750
After you promoted I could not agree with you.

1805
01:43:56,751 --> 01:43:58,759
I used to see you every day.

1806
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:00,870
Now I do not even know what work route.

1807
01:44:00,871 --> 01:44:04,772
I changed a lot, now I'm in Greentree.

1808
01:44:04,773 --> 01:44:06,601
Picking up trash whites.

1809
01:44:06,602 --> 01:44:09,440
Greentree, right? You got lucky.

1810
01:44:09,441 --> 01:44:11,789
At least you not have to lift brasses.

1811
01:44:11,790 --> 01:44:14,360
They are becoming heavier.

1812
01:44:14,361 --> 01:44:17,118
I'll work two more years and I'll leave.

1813
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:19,110
I am also thinking of retiring.

1814
01:44:19,490 --> 01:44:21,423
For you it's easy.

1815
01:44:21,424 --> 01:44:24,275
You can drive for another five years.

1816
01:44:25,489 --> 01:44:27,012
It is not the same, Bono.

1817
01:44:27,013 --> 01:44:28,854
It's not like working behind the truck.

1818
01:44:30,058 --> 01:44:33,920
It feels as if you worked alone, you have no one to talk to.

1819
01:44:35,209 --> 01:44:37,312
I'm thinking about retiring.

1820
01:44:37,313 --> 01:44:39,713
- How is Lucille? - It's okay.

1821
01:44:39,714 --> 01:44:42,584
Arthritis occasionally gives discomfort.

1822
01:44:42,585 --> 01:44:44,799
I saw Rose way here.

1823
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,641
He went to the church, right?

1824
01:44:46,642 --> 01:44:48,478
Yes, now he spends there.

1825
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:51,583
With all those preachers seeking to fill their pockets.

1826
01:44:52,454 --> 01:44:54,022
I have a little gin.

1827
01:44:54,023 --> 01:44:57,381
No thanks. I just went to say hello.

1828
01:44:57,382 --> 01:44:59,174
You can have a drink, black.

1829
01:44:59,175 --> 01:45:01,471
I saw you never refusing a drink.

1830
01:45:03,629 --> 01:45:06,768
- You do not have work tomorrow. - I just went to see you.

1831
01:45:06,769 --> 01:45:11,228
I'll pick Skinner house. We played dominoes every Friday.

1832
01:45:11,229 --> 01:45:12,729
Black, you play not dominate.

1833
01:45:12,730 --> 01:45:15,433
I used to earn 4 sets of 5.

1834
01:45:15,734 --> 01:45:18,343
Well ... that taught me.

1835
01:45:18,344 --> 01:45:20,035
Now I play better.

1836
01:45:20,646 --> 01:45:22,307
Yes?

1837
01:45:28,613 --> 01:45:30,471
Then it's okay.

1838
01:45:32,124 --> 01:45:36,432
I have to go. Spend one day.

1839
01:45:36,433 --> 01:45:38,429
Yes, I do, Bono.

1840
01:45:40,248 --> 01:45:42,738
Lucille told Rose

1841
01:45:42,739 --> 01:45:45,155
you bought a new refrigerator.

1842
01:45:45,156 --> 01:45:49,717
Yes, Rose told Lucille that eventually you built the fence.

1843
01:45:49,718 --> 01:45:52,122
So we're even.

1844
01:45:52,123 --> 01:45:53,541
I knew you would do it.

1845
01:45:54,153 --> 01:45:55,474
Yes...

1846
01:45:57,180 --> 01:45:58,743
Agree.

1847
01:45:59,796 --> 01:46:02,772
- We will speak later. - I was glad to see you, Bono.

1848
01:46:03,905 --> 01:46:05,453
I will go to visit you.

1849
01:46:05,454 --> 01:46:07,757
Yes. Okay, Troy.

1850
01:46:16,882 --> 01:46:21,565
Hear! Hear!

1851
01:46:27,582 --> 01:46:30,737
He had a dog named Blue.

1852
01:46:33,981 --> 01:46:37,127
Know Blue was very loyal.

1853
01:46:43,685 --> 01:46:47,157
Blue was a good dog.

1854
01:46:50,725 --> 01:46:54,200
Blue cornered a possum in a hollow log.

1855
01:47:08,787 --> 01:47:12,072
Old Blue died and dug his grave.

1856
01:47:13,539 --> 01:47:16,992
I put it inside with a golden chain.

1857
01:47:20,037 --> 01:47:23,120
Every time I heard barking ...

1858
01:47:26,699 --> 01:47:29,836
Blue had cornered a possum Noah's ark.

1859
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:36,141
I need to spend.

1860
01:47:36,973 --> 01:47:38,570
How? What did you say?

1861
01:47:38,571 --> 01:47:40,551
You're in my way. I need to spend.

1862
01:47:44,878 --> 01:47:46,350
Spend where?

1863
01:47:48,068 --> 01:47:51,165
It's my house, I bought it.

1864
01:47:51,166 --> 01:47:52,847
It took 15 years.

1865
01:47:52,848 --> 01:47:56,120
If you want to get to my house when I'm sitting on the steps,

1866
01:47:56,121 --> 01:47:57,800
I'll ask you permission as your mother taught you.

1867
01:47:57,801 --> 01:48:00,038
- I need to go. - Are you going to pass over?

1868
01:48:00,039 --> 01:48:01,414
I also live here.

1869
01:48:02,112 --> 01:48:04,292
Are you going to go over in my own house?

1870
01:48:04,293 --> 01:48:05,946
I'm not afraid.

1871
01:48:05,947 --> 01:48:07,613
I did not ask if you were afraid.

1872
01:48:07,614 --> 01:48:10,432
I asked you if you were going to go over me in my own home.

1873
01:48:10,433 --> 01:48:13,962
That is the question. Are not you going to ask my permission? You only spend?

1874
01:48:13,963 --> 01:48:16,281
- If you want to see so ... - How else I can see it?

1875
01:48:16,282 --> 01:48:18,353
He was going to go through your side to enter the house

1876
01:48:18,354 --> 01:48:20,830
because you're sitting on the steps, drinking and singing.

1877
01:48:20,831 --> 01:48:22,503
- You can see it. - Without asking for permission?

1878
01:48:27,057 --> 01:48:28,806
I asked you a question.

1879
01:48:28,807 --> 01:48:30,407
Without asking for permission?

1880
01:48:30,408 --> 01:48:32,983
I have to ask permission. Here no more accounts.

1881
01:48:35,897 --> 01:48:37,973
I get it, I'm not worth anything here.

1882
01:48:37,974 --> 01:48:39,517
No need to ask your father's permission.

1883
01:48:39,518 --> 01:48:44,313
Suddenly, you grew so much that your father is worthless.

1884
01:48:44,694 --> 01:48:49,325
Here at home and patio he paid with his own sweat.

1885
01:48:49,326 --> 01:48:52,787
You grew so much that your father is worthless.

1886
01:48:52,788 --> 01:48:54,296
Are you going to stay with it?

1887
01:48:56,054 --> 01:48:59,119
You want to stay with my house? You want to wear my pants?

1888
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:01,392
Are you going to sleep in my bed?

1889
01:49:02,614 --> 01:49:04,630
No need to ask permission

1890
01:49:04,631 --> 01:49:07,385
because your father is worthless. Is that?

1891
01:49:07,386 --> 01:49:08,776
So is.

1892
01:49:08,777 --> 01:49:11,476
You always talk such nonsense. Why not go out of my way.

1893
01:49:11,477 --> 01:49:13,690
I guess you have a place to sleep.

1894
01:49:14,062 --> 01:49:15,836
Something to put on your tummy.

1895
01:49:16,573 --> 01:49:18,099
Do you have that?

1896
01:49:20,187 --> 01:49:21,804
Because that's what you need.

1897
01:49:22,431 --> 01:49:23,985
You got it?

1898
01:49:24,983 --> 01:49:27,520
I do not know what, you do not have to worry about that.

1899
01:49:27,821 --> 01:49:29,311
You're right.

1900
01:49:29,366 --> 01:49:31,465
You are 100% correct.

1901
01:49:31,466 --> 01:49:35,106
I spent the last 17 years worrying about what you have.

1902
01:49:35,107 --> 01:49:36,895
Now is your turn.

1903
01:49:37,359 --> 01:49:39,322
I'll tell you what:

1904
01:49:39,915 --> 01:49:42,786
You grew up. We saw that.

1905
01:49:43,304 --> 01:49:46,139
You are a man. Now I want to see you act like one.

1906
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:48,163
Turn around and get out of this yard.

1907
01:49:48,164 --> 01:49:51,317
And when you get to the alley, you can forget about this house.

1908
01:49:51,318 --> 01:49:52,731
Because this house is mine.

1909
01:49:52,732 --> 01:49:55,516
If you're going to be a man, get yourself your own home.

1910
01:49:55,517 --> 01:49:57,712
You can forget about this because this is mine.

1911
01:49:57,713 --> 01:50:00,856
Go fetch yours because I'm tired provide for you.

1912
01:50:00,857 --> 01:50:02,380
What are you talking about? What you give me?

1913
01:50:02,381 --> 01:50:06,597
Your feet and bones. Your heart beating, black!

1914
01:50:06,965 --> 01:50:09,124
I have given you more than anyone!

1915
01:50:09,125 --> 01:50:10,732
You never gave me anything!

1916
01:50:11,259 --> 01:50:14,418
You never did anything to limit myself for fear that was better than you.

1917
01:50:16,142 --> 01:50:18,079
All you've done is try to scare me.

1918
01:50:19,002 --> 01:50:21,161
I used to tremble every time you called my name.

1919
01:50:21,162 --> 01:50:23,167
Every time I heard your footsteps in this house.

1920
01:50:23,767 --> 01:50:26,098
It all the time asking: "What will dad if I do this?"

1921
01:50:26,099 --> 01:50:29,113
"What will you say if I do that?" "What will you say if I turn on the radio?"

1922
01:50:29,114 --> 01:50:31,213
And mom too, but she tries afraid of you.

1923
01:50:31,214 --> 01:50:33,624
- Let your mother out of this. - I do not know how you hold.

1924
01:50:33,625 --> 01:50:36,212
- I told you to leave her out! - What are you going to do?

1925
01:50:36,213 --> 01:50:38,988
驴Beat me up? You already can not, you're too old!

1926
01:50:38,989 --> 01:50:40,328
You're just an old man!

1927
01:50:40,629 --> 01:50:43,409
Black! That's what you are.

1928
01:50:45,806 --> 01:50:48,848
You're just another black on the street for me.

1929
01:50:48,849 --> 01:50:51,371
- Are you crazy! Did you know? - Yes.

1930
01:50:51,372 --> 01:50:53,774
You can go, get out of my sight. You have the devil inside.

1931
01:50:53,775 --> 01:50:55,929
You're an old fool, talking about that I have the devil inside!

1932
01:50:55,930 --> 01:50:58,952
I'm crazy! If you do not get out of my yard,

1933
01:50:58,953 --> 01:51:01,154
I'll show you how crazy I am.

1934
01:51:01,155 --> 01:51:02,907
Now get the fuck out of my yard!

1935
01:51:02,908 --> 01:51:04,242
This is not your yard!

1936
01:51:04,243 --> 01:51:05,748
You took the money to Uncle Gabe received Army

1937
01:51:05,749 --> 01:51:07,248
to buy this house and then drove out.

1938
01:51:07,249 --> 01:51:09,797
Get out your black ass out of my yard!

1939
01:51:09,798 --> 01:51:11,261
I'm not going anywhere!

1940
01:51:11,262 --> 01:51:13,084
Come on, get me! I'm not afraid.

1941
01:51:14,914 --> 01:51:16,604
- That's my bat. - Come.

1942
01:51:16,605 --> 01:51:18,684
- Let go of my bat. - Come on, get me out.

1943
01:51:19,468 --> 01:51:21,958
What's up? You're not so bad? Kick me out!

1944
01:51:22,059 --> 01:51:23,844
You'll have to use it.

1945
01:51:25,584 --> 01:51:28,682
If you lift that bat before me you'll have to use it.

1946
01:51:28,683 --> 01:51:29,987
Friend!

1947
01:51:30,664 --> 01:51:32,215
Friend!

1948
01:51:32,216 --> 01:51:33,813
You'll have to kill me.

1949
01:51:34,452 --> 01:51:37,370
If you're going to threaten me with that bat,

1950
01:51:38,829 --> 01:51:41,033
You'll have to kill me.

1951
01:51:42,065 --> 01:51:43,726
Come on.

1952
01:51:50,442 --> 01:51:51,888
Come on...

1953
01:51:52,198 --> 01:51:54,241
Then I'll show you.

1954
01:51:54,242 --> 01:51:55,698
Come on!

1955
01:52:34,410 --> 01:52:36,359
Go, get out of my house.

1956
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:47,888
Himself.

1957
01:52:48,509 --> 01:52:50,147
Tomorrow I'll get my things.

1958
01:52:50,148 --> 01:52:52,540
They will be on the other side of the fence.

1959
01:53:05,335 --> 01:53:07,308
I do not feel like anything.

1960
01:53:17,801 --> 01:53:19,861
I do not feel like anything.

1961
01:53:23,338 --> 01:53:27,273
Hallelujah!

1962
01:53:29,179 --> 01:53:31,063
Hallelujah...

1963
01:53:41,335 --> 01:53:43,015
Hallelujah.

1964
01:53:45,731 --> 01:53:47,916
I do not feel like anything.

1965
01:53:55,757 --> 01:53:57,084
Come on.

1966
01:53:58,250 --> 01:54:00,169
It is between you and me now.

1967
01:54:01,767 --> 01:54:03,270
Come on.

1968
01:54:03,394 --> 01:54:05,225
When you want.

1969
01:54:05,993 --> 01:54:07,409
Come on.

1970
01:54:07,410 --> 01:54:09,629
I'm ready for you.

1971
01:54:11,144 --> 01:54:13,725
It will not be easy.

1972
01:54:26,498 --> 01:54:28,904
- Raynell? - Mrs?

1973
01:54:28,905 --> 01:54:30,861
- What are you doing? - Nothing.

1974
01:54:30,862 --> 01:54:33,029
Come in and see dressed. What are you doing?

1975
01:54:33,584 --> 01:54:35,522
Seeing if my garden grew.

1976
01:54:35,523 --> 01:54:38,197
I told you will not grow overnight. You have to wait.

1977
01:54:38,198 --> 01:54:41,829
It seems it will never grow. Go.

1978
01:54:41,830 --> 01:54:44,159
I told you a pot that is monitored, never boils.

1979
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:46,005
This is not a pot, Mom.

1980
01:54:46,006 --> 01:54:49,181
Enters dressed. It is not to be playing tomorrow, you hear me?

1981
01:54:49,567 --> 01:54:50,918
Yes, ma'am.

1982
01:54:53,723 --> 01:54:55,126
Garden bad.

1983
01:55:16,872 --> 01:55:18,205
Hi.

1984
01:55:18,862 --> 01:55:20,637
I bet your name is Raynell.

1985
01:55:23,308 --> 01:55:24,858
Your mom is at home?

1986
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:28,467
Mom, there's a man here.

1987
01:55:28,768 --> 01:55:30,112
Mom!

1988
01:55:30,113 --> 01:55:31,723
驴Cory?

1989
01:55:34,387 --> 01:55:35,674
隆Cory!

1990
01:55:35,975 --> 01:55:38,317
隆Cory! 隆Cory!

1991
01:55:39,549 --> 01:55:42,152
Thank God!

1992
01:55:46,221 --> 01:55:47,722
Look at all.

1993
01:55:49,446 --> 01:55:52,226
What have we here?

1994
01:55:53,166 --> 01:55:56,261
- All grown up. - Why are you crying?

1995
01:55:56,262 --> 01:55:58,335
I'm so glad you were able to survive.

1996
01:55:59,112 --> 01:56:01,156
Hello, Lyons. How are you, Mr. Bono?

1997
01:56:01,157 --> 01:56:03,016
Look at you, man. Look to you.

1998
01:56:03,417 --> 01:56:05,973
It does not look right, Rose? They did it out.

1999
01:56:05,974 --> 01:56:07,561
Why took you so long?

2000
01:56:07,562 --> 01:56:09,486
You know how it is in the Navy, Mom.

2001
01:56:09,487 --> 01:56:11,486
You have to do all the paperwork for you to stop doing something.

2002
01:56:11,487 --> 01:56:13,633
Well, I'm glad you made it.

2003
01:56:13,634 --> 01:56:16,406
They stopped coming to Lyons, you Uncle Gabe's in the hospital.

2004
01:56:16,407 --> 01:56:18,303
I do not know if they'll let him come.

2005
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,918
I just talked to them.

2006
01:56:19,919 --> 01:56:22,261
After a US Navy.

2007
01:56:22,262 --> 01:56:24,665
Your father knew you were capable of.

2008
01:56:24,666 --> 01:56:26,765
I said it all the time.

2009
01:56:26,766 --> 01:56:28,619
You do not look good, Mr. Bond?

2010
01:56:28,620 --> 01:56:32,086
Yes, Troy reminds me of the first time I met him.

2011
01:56:33,044 --> 01:56:37,226
Rose, Lucille is in the church choir.

2012
01:56:37,227 --> 01:56:39,297
I will bring to those who carry the coffin.

2013
01:56:39,298 --> 01:56:42,053
- Then I return for you. - Thanks, Jim.

2014
01:56:42,054 --> 01:56:43,358
See you, Mr. Bono.

2015
01:56:47,101 --> 01:56:50,197
Cory, mira a Raynell.

2016
01:56:50,498 --> 01:56:52,931
Is not it beautiful? It will break many hearts.

2017
01:56:52,932 --> 01:56:55,012
Raynell, say hello to your brother. This is your brother, Cory.

2018
01:56:55,013 --> 01:56:56,630
- You remember Cory? - No ma'am.

2019
01:56:56,631 --> 01:56:58,477
He does not remember, Mom.

2020
01:56:58,478 --> 01:57:00,867
We talk about you, they hear us talk about you.

2021
01:57:01,228 --> 01:57:03,194
It's your brother Cory. I say hello.

2022
01:57:03,534 --> 01:57:05,474
- Hello. - Hello.

2023
01:57:05,475 --> 01:57:07,042
So you're Raynell?

2024
01:57:07,766 --> 01:57:09,487
Your mother tells me a lot about you.

2025
01:57:10,089 --> 01:57:12,831
Come, I'll make you some breakfast to have strength.

2026
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:15,262
- I'm not hungry, Mom. - Can you make me something, Rose.

2027
01:57:15,263 --> 01:57:16,586
I will in a minute.

2028
01:57:16,587 --> 01:57:19,687
Are you sure you want nothing, Cory? I know you do not eat well.

2029
01:57:19,688 --> 01:57:22,432
No, Mom, thanks. I'm not hungry, then I eat.

2030
01:57:23,556 --> 01:57:26,739
Raynell, dress up and stand like I said.

2031
01:57:37,495 --> 01:57:40,637
I always knew you were going to be somebody.

2032
01:57:42,501 --> 01:57:44,919
Your head was always in the right direction.

2033
01:57:47,766 --> 01:57:49,390
So...

2034
01:57:50,749 --> 01:57:52,385
Are you going to stay in the Navy?

2035
01:57:52,735 --> 01:57:55,219
You are about to make a career, you're 20 years?

2036
01:57:55,220 --> 01:57:56,751
I dont know.

2037
01:57:57,221 --> 01:57:59,035
And I spent six years, I think that's enough.

2038
01:57:59,036 --> 01:58:01,765
Stay with Uncle Sam and retire early.

2039
01:58:02,788 --> 01:58:04,521
There is nothing here.

2040
01:58:06,072 --> 01:58:09,042
Rose told you guess what happened to me.

2041
01:58:11,283 --> 01:58:13,523
I was put in a prison.

2042
01:58:14,108 --> 01:58:17,541
I thought I was being clever charging money from others.

2043
01:58:18,460 --> 01:58:20,110
How long have you kept?

2044
01:58:20,964 --> 01:58:22,903
I got 3 years.

2045
01:58:23,624 --> 01:58:26,771
I have little time longer, missing only 9 months.

2046
01:58:31,666 --> 01:58:33,618
It's not that bad.

2047
01:58:34,462 --> 01:58:36,944
You learn to deal with it as with everything else.

2048
01:58:39,557 --> 01:58:42,020
"You have to accept the straight lines and curves."

2049
01:58:42,021 --> 01:58:43,704
It's what Dad used to say.

2050
01:58:45,023 --> 01:58:47,414
Used to say that when I failed.

2051
01:58:48,651 --> 01:58:51,320
I saw him strike out three times,

2052
01:58:51,321 --> 01:58:54,595
and next take the ball out of the park.

2053
01:58:55,394 --> 01:58:57,692
Outside the stadium Homestead.

2054
01:58:58,792 --> 01:59:01,068
he was not satisfied beating up the seats,

2055
01:59:01,069 --> 01:59:03,005
I wanted to hit and fly around the stadium.

2056
01:59:04,449 --> 01:59:06,277
And after the game ...

2057
01:59:07,427 --> 01:59:12,122
There were 200 people waiting for him to shake hands.

2058
01:59:14,891 --> 01:59:18,129
"You have to accept the straight lines and curves."

2059
01:59:21,679 --> 01:59:23,667
Dad was out of the ordinary.

2060
01:59:24,826 --> 01:59:26,615
Are you still playing?

2061
01:59:27,009 --> 01:59:29,001
Cory, you know that's what I do.

2062
01:59:29,684 --> 01:59:32,111
I have some friends and formed a band.

2063
01:59:32,112 --> 01:59:36,002
We try to be together when we get out, but ...

2064
01:59:37,364 --> 01:59:39,493
I'm still playing.

2065
01:59:40,059 --> 01:59:42,079
I'm helping to make the bed in the morning.

2066
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:44,051
While still doing that,

2067
01:59:44,052 --> 01:59:46,381
I will try to make it all make sense.

2068
01:59:46,382 --> 01:59:48,858
Lyons, I have the eggs in the pan.

2069
01:59:51,465 --> 01:59:55,610
I will eat those eggs. Get ready to bury dad.

2070
02:00:01,506 --> 02:00:03,127
How are you?

2071
02:00:04,323 --> 02:00:06,084
You're good?

2072
02:00:23,828 --> 02:00:26,231
- Hello. - Hello.

2073
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:29,996
驴You stayed to sleep in my room?

2074
02:00:30,412 --> 02:00:32,509
Yes, that used to be my room.

2075
02:00:33,020 --> 02:00:34,738
That was how he called Dad.

2076
02:00:34,739 --> 02:00:36,472
"Cory's room."

2077
02:00:38,188 --> 02:00:40,383
You have your football in the closet.

2078
02:00:40,384 --> 02:00:43,563
Raynell, up dressed. Put on your new shoes.

2079
02:00:43,564 --> 02:00:46,090
Mom, I can not use these? Others had hurt my feet!

2080
02:00:46,091 --> 02:00:47,876
Well, they will have to lastim谩rtelos a bit.

2081
02:00:47,877 --> 02:00:50,545
You did not say you hurt when you went to the store to buy them.

2082
02:00:50,546 --> 02:00:52,678
At that time did not hurt me, my feet have grown.

2083
02:00:52,679 --> 02:00:54,240
I do not talk back!

2084
02:00:54,241 --> 02:00:56,608
Go up and get new shoes.

2085
02:02:04,436 --> 02:02:06,620
things have not changed much.

2086
02:02:07,527 --> 02:02:10,235
Still has that thing tied to the tree.

2087
02:02:13,405 --> 02:02:15,604
I was moving out here that bat.

2088
02:02:16,954 --> 02:02:19,978
I was ready to return home.

2089
02:02:21,012 --> 02:02:24,152
He made a motion with the bat and fell.

2090
02:02:26,296 --> 02:02:30,817
It seems that when he did stood with a smile on his face.

2091
02:02:36,119 --> 02:02:38,145
And then he fell.

2092
02:02:40,595 --> 02:02:44,442
He was taken to hospital, but knew it was not necessary.

2093
02:02:46,985 --> 02:02:49,702
- Why not enter? - Mom, I have to tell you.

2094
02:02:51,928 --> 02:02:54,586
I do not know how to say this, but I have to.

2095
02:02:55,179 --> 02:02:57,194
I will not go to Dad's funeral.

2096
02:02:59,526 --> 02:03:01,171
Boy...

2097
02:03:01,172 --> 02:03:03,295
Hush that mouth.

2098
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:05,928
You're talking about your father!

2099
02:03:05,929 --> 02:03:07,783
I do not want that kind of conversation this morning.

2100
02:03:07,784 --> 02:03:09,503
I raised you for you left me with that?

2101
02:03:09,504 --> 02:03:12,950
You're there all healthy and growing, and I say that not going to the funeral?

2102
02:03:12,951 --> 02:03:14,941
- Mom, listen ... - I do not wanna know, Cory.

2103
02:03:14,942 --> 02:03:16,585
Remove that idea from your head.

2104
02:03:16,586 --> 02:03:19,141
I have nothing to say. Once in my life I have to say no.

2105
02:03:19,142 --> 02:03:20,804
I do not want to hear any of that.

2106
02:03:20,805 --> 02:03:22,587
I know you and your father did not get along,

2107
02:03:22,588 --> 02:03:25,022
but I do not need that kind of talk today.

2108
02:03:25,813 --> 02:03:28,609
Disrespecting your father will not make you a man, Cory.

2109
02:03:28,610 --> 02:03:30,466
You'll have to find another way to do that.

2110
02:03:30,467 --> 02:03:33,107
Do not go to the funeral of your father will not make you a man.

2111
02:03:35,676 --> 02:03:38,713
All the time I lived at home,

2112
02:03:38,714 --> 02:03:41,650
Dad was like a shadow that followed you everywhere.

2113
02:03:42,297 --> 02:03:45,453
It was heavy and got into your flesh.

2114
02:03:46,258 --> 02:03:47,933
you wrapped

2115
02:03:47,934 --> 02:03:50,600
and he stayed there until you could not distinguish yours.

2116
02:03:51,084 --> 02:03:54,645
That shadow you got into the meat!

2117
02:03:55,156 --> 02:03:57,714
Trying to treparte over, trying to live through you.

2118
02:03:58,205 --> 02:04:02,178
Everywhere he looked, Troy Maxson was watching you.

2119
02:04:03,114 --> 02:04:05,430
Under the bed, in the closet.

2120
02:04:06,570 --> 02:04:09,805
I have to find a way to get rid of that shadow, Mom.

2121
02:04:09,806 --> 02:04:12,908
- You like him. Igualito. - Do not tell me that, Mom.

2122
02:04:12,909 --> 02:04:16,610
- Troy Maxson're everywhere. - I do not want to be Troy Maxson!

2123
02:04:18,393 --> 02:04:19,803
I just wanna be me.

2124
02:04:19,804 --> 02:04:22,299
You can not be someone else than yourself, Cory.

2125
02:04:23,096 --> 02:04:25,915
That shadow was nothing but yourself growing inside you.

2126
02:04:25,916 --> 02:04:28,380
Or you adapt to it or it suits you.

2127
02:04:28,381 --> 02:04:30,404
But it's all you have to live.

2128
02:04:30,405 --> 02:04:34,216
It is all you have to face the world out there.

2129
02:04:35,422 --> 02:04:38,320
Your father wanted you everything he was not.

2130
02:04:38,321 --> 02:04:42,866
And at the same time wanted you all that he was.

2131
02:04:43,346 --> 02:04:46,440
I do not know if I was right or not, but I know

2132
02:04:46,441 --> 02:04:49,168
I wanted to do more good than harm.

2133
02:04:51,218 --> 02:04:53,870
Sometimes when touched, he hurts.

2134
02:04:54,627 --> 02:04:58,309
Sometimes when I held her, I cut.

2135
02:05:04,790 --> 02:05:09,659
When I met him for the first time, I thought:

2136
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:13,214
"This is the man I have a black son."

2137
02:05:16,295 --> 02:05:19,042
It was the first thing I thought when I saw it.

2138
02:05:19,043 --> 02:05:22,100
Thought, "Rose Lee,

2139
02:05:22,101 --> 02:05:24,584
here is the man who can open up

2140
02:05:24,585 --> 02:05:26,849
and be completely satisfied. "

2141
02:05:28,213 --> 02:05:30,749
"Here he is the man who can

2142
02:05:30,850 --> 02:05:33,353
fill all the empty spaces

2143
02:05:33,354 --> 02:05:35,659
you've been feeling incomplete. "

2144
02:05:40,781 --> 02:05:45,929
When your father walked through the house, it was ...

2145
02:05:46,558 --> 02:05:52,636
So great ... that filled the house.

2146
02:05:55,110 --> 02:05:57,214
That was my first mistake.

2147
02:05:57,787 --> 02:06:02,276
I do not give me some space, but ...

2148
02:06:04,748 --> 02:06:07,631
I wanted a house where I could sing.

2149
02:06:08,726 --> 02:06:11,110
And that's what gave me your father.

2150
02:06:12,174 --> 02:06:14,026
I did not know how to keep their strength

2151
02:06:14,027 --> 02:06:16,345
so I had to give small parts of me.

2152
02:06:17,933 --> 02:06:20,766
I accepted his life like mine

2153
02:06:20,767 --> 02:06:24,285
and I mixed the parts you could not tell them apart.

2154
02:06:27,098 --> 02:06:30,457
It was my choice. My life...

2155
02:06:30,458 --> 02:06:34,612
And it had to live like this, but ...

2156
02:06:35,770 --> 02:06:39,397
It was what life offered me as a woman and I accepted.

2157
02:06:41,249 --> 02:06:43,527
I grabbed it with both hands

2158
02:06:44,284 --> 02:06:47,189
and when Raynell came home ...

2159
02:06:52,455 --> 02:06:54,988
I do not want to make a blessing

2160
02:06:54,989 --> 02:06:56,547
the misfortune of anyone, but ...

2161
02:06:58,274 --> 02:07:01,450
I accepted Raynell like

2162
02:07:01,451 --> 02:07:04,819
all the babies wanted and never had.

2163
02:07:06,923 --> 02:07:10,108
As if she blessed to alleviate a part of my life.

2164
02:07:12,995 --> 02:07:16,252
And if the Lord gives me strength ...

2165
02:07:18,081 --> 02:07:22,565
I'll raise her exactly like your father raised you.

2166
02:07:25,899 --> 02:07:28,993
I'll give the best in me.

2167
02:07:38,583 --> 02:07:41,910
Mom ... Reverend Tollivier is on the phone.

2168
02:08:00,078 --> 02:08:01,613
Hi.

2169
02:08:03,362 --> 02:08:04,765
Hi.

2170
02:08:04,766 --> 02:08:08,610
- Are you in the Army or Navy? - In the Navy.

2171
02:08:09,675 --> 02:08:11,830
Dad said you were in the Army.

2172
02:08:11,831 --> 02:08:14,962
- Did you meet Blue? - Blue? Who is Blue?

2173
02:08:14,963 --> 02:08:17,386
The cub dad singing all the time.

2174
02:08:19,695 --> 02:08:22,541
Hear! Hear!

2175
02:08:23,994 --> 02:08:26,605
He had a dog named Blue.

2176
02:08:27,650 --> 02:08:29,788
Blue was very loyal.

2177
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:32,905
Blue was a good dog.

2178
02:08:34,006 --> 02:08:36,633
Blue corralled a possum in the trunk of a tree.

2179
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:39,126
Here we see that Blue was a good dog.

2180
02:08:39,127 --> 02:08:41,728
Hear! Hear!

2181
02:08:42,101 --> 02:08:44,787
Blue corralled a possum of a leg.

2182
02:08:44,788 --> 02:08:47,255
Blue looked at me and I looked at him.

2183
02:08:47,256 --> 02:08:49,813
I grabbed the opossum and put it in the bag.

2184
02:08:49,814 --> 02:08:52,313
Blue stood there until I returned.

2185
02:08:52,314 --> 02:08:54,898
Blue legs were big and round.

2186
02:08:54,899 --> 02:08:57,398
He never let the opossum landfall.

2187
02:08:57,399 --> 02:09:00,009
Old Blue died and dug his grave.

2188
02:09:00,010 --> 02:09:02,571
I dug his grave with a silver sword.

2189
02:09:02,572 --> 02:09:05,120
I put it inside with a golden chain.

2190
02:09:05,121 --> 02:09:07,469
And every time I call your name:

2191
02:09:07,470 --> 02:09:10,585
"Go ahead, Blue. Good dog." Sing ...

2192
02:09:10,586 --> 02:09:13,068
"Go ahead, Blue. Good dog."

2193
02:09:13,069 --> 02:09:15,641
Blue sat back and died like a man.

2194
02:09:15,642 --> 02:09:18,005
Blue sat back and died ...

2195
02:09:18,585 --> 02:09:22,895
Blue sat back and died like a man.

2196
02:09:23,755 --> 02:09:26,566
Now corrals possums in the Promised Land.

2197
02:09:27,350 --> 02:09:30,105
I'll tell you this so you know.

2198
02:09:30,106 --> 02:09:32,829
Blue was where good dogs go.

2199
02:09:34,517 --> 02:09:38,400
Blue was where good dogs go.

2200
02:09:41,327 --> 02:09:43,736
Cory, we're ready to go.

2201
02:09:48,732 --> 02:09:51,016
Come on.

2202
02:09:51,174 --> 02:09:53,726
Go up and put your shoes as mom told you.

2203
02:09:53,727 --> 02:09:56,284
So we can go to Dad's funeral.

2204
02:09:57,563 --> 02:10:00,380
Well, I'll be back.

2205
02:10:14,074 --> 02:10:17,050
Hey, Rose! I'm here!

2206
02:10:17,051 --> 02:10:19,596
I arrived, Rose! I arrived!

2207
02:10:19,897 --> 02:10:21,406
隆Lyons, mira!

2208
02:10:21,407 --> 02:10:23,675
You see, Rose? I told you to come.

2209
02:10:23,676 --> 02:10:26,022
- How are you, Uncle Gabe? - How are you, Uncle Gabe?

2210
02:10:26,023 --> 02:10:27,950
Hey ... Hey, Rose, it's time.

2211
02:10:27,951 --> 02:10:30,980
It's time to tell St. Peter to open the doors.

2212
02:10:34,408 --> 02:10:36,275
Are you ready, Troy?

2213
02:10:36,276 --> 02:10:38,013
驴Troy, you ready?

2214
02:10:38,014 --> 02:10:41,321
I'll tell St. Peter to open the doors.

2215
02:10:41,322 --> 02:10:43,589
