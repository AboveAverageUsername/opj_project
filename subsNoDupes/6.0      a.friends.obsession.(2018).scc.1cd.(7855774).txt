Odlično Megan. Samo...

Dobar posao, Sali.
Samo ga zadržati slobodno.

14
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:52,226
Pazi preko srednjeg prsta ulazna ruke.

15
00:00:55,185 --> 00:00:56,665
Fantastičan.

16
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:02,255
Ti podešavanje svoju "savršenu formu?"

Oh, ne, ja samo drži za ruku

18

Se udobno.

20
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:11,917
Ratnik tri.

21
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:19,557
Veliki.

22
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,146
I dalje savršeno.

23
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,234
Pa, pogodno za nekoga

00:01:24,258 --> 00:01:25,583
ko nije pravilno diše.

25
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:27,019
I ako ne onesvestim?

26
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:29,239
Pa, onda ću morati da te oživi...

27
00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:31,545

00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:13,413
Hej, Megan, koja plava bi trebalo
da koristimo u prezentaciji tabli?

34
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:15,807
Ona kaže kraljevsko plave.
Mislim da je to više od zimzelen.

35
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:17,243
Zimzelen ne vrišti.

36
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:18,288
"Kupite ovu najnoviju komad tehnologije."

37
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:19,898
Više od kraljevsko plava radi?

38
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:22,030
Dobro, vidi, momci, zašto ne bi Mock-up i

Hladan. Rekao sam ti rekla sam ti.

00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:31,020
Hej! Hej!

43
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,568
O Bože! Šta?

00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:40,223
Nešto. Čekati. Nemoj mi reći.

45
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:42,790
Dobro, bilo poljubi me ili

00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:58,806
Svako zaslužuje veliko iznenađenje trenutak.

53
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,113
Pokaži mi! Dobro.

54
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:02,245
Moja leva ruka već oseća teži.

55
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:04,377
Ah, tačno! Vov!

56
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:05,944

00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:24,615

Hear what?

92
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:18,381

00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:20,557
Yeah. Just over the weekend.

94
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:21,906
Wait... Wait, you're kidding me.

95
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,387
Nope. Crazy. Wha...

96
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:26,432
Uh, ali šta se desilo?
Automobilska nezgoda?

97
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:28,632
Niko. Ludi. On je ubijen.

98
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,394
O Bože!

99
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,918
Kako? Mislim, gde?

100
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:35,398
Pa, detalji stalno menjaju.

101
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:37,530
Međutim, neki kažu... loše droge.

102
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:38,966
Šta? Da.

103
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,404
Drugi kažu, samo pljačka gone bad.

104
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:44,276
On je izboden, kao, mnogo.

105
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,300
O Bože!

106
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,803

110
00:05:57,748 --> 00:06:00,011
Ne, ja ne znam.
Ja čak nemam ni predstavu, zapravo.

111
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,221
Znate, ja cu biti izgubljena bez tebe.

112
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:21,397
Ćete biti u redu.

113
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,376
Ne idi.

114
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:27,272
Ja samo... ne mogu da ostanem ovde.

115
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:31,102
I know.

116
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:35,672
God, I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you too.

117
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,590
Oh... Why're you moving so far away?

118
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:43,264
But, hej...

119
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:45,008
at least you'll be closer to my wedding.

120
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:49,619
God, I'm such a jerk. I'm sorry...

121
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:52,689
No, it's okay. I am so, so happy for you.

122
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:57,017
It's just... It's still raw.

123
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,478
Yeah, I know.

124
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:01,219
Uh, hej.

125
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,092
Call me.

126
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,984
All the time.

127
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:08,270
I will.

128
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:19,977
Okay. Okay.

129
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:27,744
Hej, Lloyd.

130
00:08:27,768 --> 00:08:29,030
Uh, hi, Brooke.

131
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:37,037
Uh, Megan.

132
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:40,955
This is for you.

133
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:45,805
That's so sweet of you.

134
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:47,677
Just wanted to let you know that, uh

135
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,485
svi ćemo mi nedostajati ovde.

136
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,228
Hvala vam.

137
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:58,470
Uh, mogu li da te pitam ludo pitanje?

138
00:08:58,494 --> 00:09:00,341
Dobro.

139
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:02,735
Šta radiš sada?

140
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,825
Idem kući da završi pakovanje.

141
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:07,131
Verovatno se nešto za jelo.

142
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:08,611
Ostavljam prva stvar ujutru.

143
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:11,899
Da li biste...
Mislim, mogu li da te častim pićem?

144
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,447
Uh, to ne znači ništa. Samo sam, uh...

145
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:21,580
Znam kako je teško u
poslednjih nekoliko meseci.

146
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,234
Verovatno je za vas

147
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:24,801
i ja hteo da znate da

148
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,065
uvek ćete imati prijatelje ovde.

149
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:29,632
Ne znam, to...

150
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:32,330
Da. Ne, ja, shvatam. Samo sam, uh...

151
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:34,245
Mislila sam...

152
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:35,289
Oh, dođavola, ne znam.

153
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:36,943
Um, I thought it might be nice

154
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:39,555
to out with a toast and a
grin, instead of a...

155
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,971
You know what?

156
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,168
Yeah.

157
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,865
I think a, a friendly toast

158
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,935
from a friendly face
would be just the thing.

159
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,306
Okay.

160
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,855
Um, just give me two seconds. Sure.

161
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,079
And then I moved here.

162
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,450
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

163
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,321
I've been talking about
myself the whole time.

164
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:10,411
No! No, it's nice.
It's nice to see you smile.

165
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:12,612
You've just been so sad.

166
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:16,287
Great, Lloyd, perfect upbeat tone.

167
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:18,008
God, punch me.

168
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:21,901
No, no, it's fine. Really.

169
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,144
It's just...

170
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:28,628
Uh, no one ever prepares you, you know?

171
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:32,588
Mislim, da ćemo se venčati.

172
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,784
Volela sam ga.

173
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:36,113
To je samo...

174
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:39,658
Tuga je tako...

175
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:40,901
Zbunjujuće.

176
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:43,120
Baš tako.

177
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,624
Kada je moj otac umro...

178
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,364
Nisam znao kako da se ponašaju.

179
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:51,714
U jednom trenutku, bio sam ljut

180
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:53,498
sledećeg minuta, bio sam neutešna.

181
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:56,806
Nema vodič, nema protokola, ne...

182
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,331
Upozorenje. Da.

183
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:02,115
Vidi, tuga je teško.

184
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:05,641
A ti si još uvek tako blizu nje, ali...

185
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,381
i ja govorim iz iskustva

186
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:08,687
ona ne postaje lakše.

187
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:10,365
I vreme zaista zaraste. Samo...

188
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,281
Moraš biti strpljiv.

189
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:17,720
Ti si stvarno lako razgovarati.

190
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:22,048
Thank you.

191
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:23,920
So are you.

192
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:25,617
Thank you. Excuse me.

193
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:26,729
Can I take your picture?

194
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:32,058
Uh... sure. Yeah.

195
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:33,344
Cool.

196
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:46,769
If you want these,
they'll be ready in few minutes.

197
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:49,162
Thank you. Okay. Cool.

198
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:50,773
Ugh, I never buy those things.

199
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:52,775
They're way too... Overpriced?

200
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,429
Right? Exactly. Yes.

201
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:57,629
Still, I think this time
I might make an exception.

202
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:01,087
Thank you.

203
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:03,263
For what?

204
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:04,727
I've had a really good time tonight.

205
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,771
How come we've never hung out before?

206
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:12,882
Uh, introverts aren't generally prone

207
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:15,972
to huge bouts of "hanging out."

208
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:18,801
Well, you're doing really
well with this small bout.

209
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:21,804
How come you don't have a girlfriend?

210
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:23,762
Psst...

211
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,546
I don't think that's gonna happen.

212
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,746
And why not?

213
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:30,116
I have no game.

214
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,379
Oh, gross. No, I...

215
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:33,883
Let me give you an insider tip, okay?

216
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,472
Game may win you a date

217
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:40,736
but never a mate.

218
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,128
Really? Yup.

219
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:43,763
Deep intel I'm giving you here.

220
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,311
Oh, no... Wha-what is this look?

221
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:53,729
I'm assessing... objectively.

222
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,013
You want it?

223
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:59,735
I guess so.
Uh, not like I'm killin' it on my own here.

224
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:04,716
Okay, so, here's the thing, Lloyd.

225
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,327
You're cute. You're marketable.

226
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:08,526
Ali to ne poseduju.

227
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:12,376
Da, vidiš? Vi ste...

228
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,118
I-ti si na Techie. Ja to znam.
Vi to live. Iznutra i spolja.

229
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:17,685
I to je zapravo stvar.

230
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,513
"Stvar?" Da, u potpunosti.

231
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:21,864
Intelektualna Hipster.

232
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:23,604
Vi samo treba pogura

233
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:26,738
u smeru Hipster.

234
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:28,653
Vi mislite da sam Vikipedija štreber.

235
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:31,961
Ali ti-ti može u potpunosti da rok. I...

236
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:34,267
Mislim, dođi ovamo. Mogu li?

237
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,965
U redu je.

238
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:44,712
Tamo. Na pola puta si već Hipster.

239
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:46,889
Uh, sjajno.

240
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:48,891
Sada, ako možete samo, uh, biti moja komoda

241
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,718
i lični stilista za ostale...

242
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:51,961
zauvek?

243
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:54,766
Hvala vam. Ne, ne.

244
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,376
Viteštvo nije mrtav

245
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,552
bar za nas pola-Hipsters.

246
00:13:58,576 --> 00:13:59,839
Ne to nije.

247
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:08,848
Verovatno bi trebalo da
prestanu da nose to, ha?

248
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:12,112
Hej, hej. U redu je.

249
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,223
Kao što sam rekao, tuga ima svoj raspored.

250
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:20,313
Ona takođe ima mina koje neočekivano

251
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:21,967
eksplodiraju kad si samo šetam okolo.

252
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:23,273
Ugh. Tu i tamo.

253
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:25,666
Znam, jel 'da?

254
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,365
Da li ste zainteresovani
za kupovinu otisak?

255
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:30,229
Uh, ne, to je u redu...
O, mi ćemo uzeti dve.

256
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:33,326
Ispraćaj uspomena.

257
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,917
Hvala vam. Nema na čemu.

258
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:38,486
U redu.

259
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:50,541
Mama će voleti ovo.

260
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:56,939
Sviđa mi se.

261
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:07,578
Dobro jutro, maleni.

262
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:09,691
Kako ste danas?

263
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,236
Lojd. Dušo.

264
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,064
Doručak.

265
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:16,195
Mama...

266
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:18,284
Dušo, hajde.

267
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:20,136
Pa, ko je lepa devojka?

268
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:25,291
Moja devojka. Oh...

269
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:29,861
Ti...

270
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:32,081
Oh, uzbudljivo! Pogledaj nju.

271
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:33,343
Nadam se da je kao ti.

272
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,282
Ona je srećna devojka, zar ne?

273
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,839
O, tako mi je drago, dušo.
Tako sam srećna zbog tebe.

274
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:53,640
Hej. Hajde, sestro.

275
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:54,839
Vreme je da udari grad.

276
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,123
Kejt.

277
00:16:58,147 --> 00:16:59,995
Ne, ja ću to da odlučim šta radimo veceras

278
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,431
i to ne kod kuće da gledaju

279
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,259
je "Veliki britanski Pecite-off."

280
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:06,044
Dobro. Ali samo ako
dođete na staze sa mene.

281
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,698
Ah, mrzim radi, ali ako je to ono

282
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,395
potrebno je da izađeš, u redu.

283
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,007
Ti si tiranin. Da, jesam. Ali da me voliš.

284
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,704
Ja radim. Oh, ovo radimo? Hajde.

285
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:14,879
Da. Mi to radimo sada, hajde.

286
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:16,383
Dobro. Running. To, bre!

287
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:24,106
Rekao si da možemo zaustaviti na tri milje.

288
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,977
You are a horrible, horrible person.

289
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:29,198
Come on, you're killing your old record.

290
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:30,851
My old record was

291
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,158
jogging with difficulty to catch the bus...

292
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:35,117
a patient...

293
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:37,162
or the fridge during a commercial break.

294
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:39,295
Refer back to horrible person, please.

295
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:41,712
Megan?

296
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:45,779
Lloyd?

297
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,521
What are you doing here?

298
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:50,654
I just moved here.

299
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:52,917
Uh, that's amazing! Ha-ha.

300
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:54,658
What a small world. Right? Yeah.

301
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:56,964
A job opportunity came up, and, I thought

302
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:58,662
w-why not?

303
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:01,143
Time for a change of scenery.
So, here I am.

304
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:04,822
Uh, this is crazy. I...

305
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,280
So, I... You look great.

306
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:11,177
Oh, thank you. Uh,
I got some fashion advice from a friend.

307
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,808
Um, hello, standing right here...

308
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:17,420
Oh, sorry. Lloyd, this is my sister, Kate.

309
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:20,249
Kate, this is my ex-colleague?

310
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:21,989
Yeah... No, that sounds weird.

311
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:24,514
Uh, this is my friend, Lloyd.

312
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:26,298
Well, Lloyd, Megan's friend

313
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:28,083
want to personally thank you for saving me

314
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,607
from a pending cardiac arrest.

315
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:32,348
No problem.

316
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:34,828
I personally only run
when I am being chased.

317
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:37,092
See? Thank you. A normal human.

318
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,528
Thank you, Lloyd.

319
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:40,573
You got it. Couch potatoes unite.

320
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:43,576
Uh, so, uh, where are you working now?

321
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,622
Uh, mostly over at, uh, Bosch Associated.

322
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:46,753
Nice.

323
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:48,190
Uh, oni rade jako dobro

324
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:49,887
od njihovog širenja na uređaje za nošenje.

325
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:52,019
Znam, jel 'da? I bla, bla, bla.

326
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:55,110
Techie, Tech, Tech... nerds.

327
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,720
Dobro. Moraćeš da oprosti moju sestru.

328
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:58,896
Ona dobija malo mrzovoljan kad znoji.

329
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,420
Ona je takođe i dalje poseduje VCR.

330
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:03,683
Ućuti. Ja sam Retro.

331
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,598
I Ja sam takođe hteo da jede svoju nogu.

332
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:07,252
Megs, molim te. Dobro.

333
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:09,211
Mi ćemo naći način da svoj dom i hranio

334
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:10,560
ali mi treba...

335
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:12,910
Trebalo bi da se nadjemo nekad.

336
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:15,217
Stvarno? Da... Da, to bi bilo sjajno.

337
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:17,219
Uh, stvarno nisam sreo nikoga ovde, još.

338
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:19,375
Da. Hm... Evo. Priključite svoj broj.

339
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,205
When I get the chance,
I'll show you around.

340
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:28,752
I would love that. Okay.

341
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:30,623
Uh, yeah, I'll let you two
get back to workin' out.

342
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:34,173
Uh, very nice to meet you,
Kate, my fellow couch potato.

343
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:37,848
I'll see you around, Megan.

344
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:39,090
See you around.

345
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,983
Let's go. No, I'm still walking.

346
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:44,007
Come on.

347
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:47,597
Come on. Go, go. You can do this.

348
00:19:56,978 --> 00:19:58,390
I guess so. Anyway, his size...

349
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,915
Yes, sir, got a good look.

350
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:03,221
You can know him if you saw him again.

351
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:05,136
Mama, it's soon.

352
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,268
I can feel it.

353
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:08,226
Really?

354
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,314
I can't wait for you to meet her.

355
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:11,490
Mm.

356
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:14,363
Well, she's no longer wearing her old ring.

357
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:17,409
Oh! You think she's finally ready?

358
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,324
Yes, mama.

359
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:21,718
It's time.

360
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:23,483
To accept your true love.

361
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:25,441
Yes.

362
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:27,748
I told you.

363
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:30,553
You did.

364
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:32,381
You were right, mama.

365
00:20:32,405 --> 00:20:34,470
She is everything.

366
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:36,602
Âª With your pretty hair âª

367
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:39,518
âª Got me looking over there at you âª

368
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:42,608
âª 'Cause I can't get enough of you... âª.

369
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:44,828
There're a lot of cute guys here.

370
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:46,395
You need to trust me. Okay? Okay.

371
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:49,204
Okay. We're... Oh, hej.

372
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,250
Him.

373
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:56,298
No. Shifty eyes. What? Wh...

374
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,624
It's a thing. Aah!

375
00:20:58,648 --> 00:20:59,693
Okay.

376
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:03,826
Him?

377
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:06,589
Uh, no.

378
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,982
Too many curls.

379
00:21:09,006 --> 00:21:11,376
You are unbelievable.

380
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,402
You are... Wow. Okay.

381
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,016
Him. Whoa. Wow.

382
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:27,523
I will be back. Be back from where?

383
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:29,070
Stay right there. Uh, no. No, Kate.

384
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:37,010
Hi. Hi.

385
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:40,971
How are you? Great.

386
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:43,582
If you're not hiding any
crazy psychological issues

387
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:46,193
da, uh, moja sestra ti platim piće?

388
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:49,719
Uh, ja nisam. I ona definitivno može.

389
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:52,093
Dobar odgovor. Da. Dobro.

390
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:56,943
Ćao. Zdravo, zdravo.

391
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,276
Dakle, šta piješ? Ja častim.

392
00:22:11,852 --> 00:22:13,308
Imaš minut?

393
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,421
To je veliki dan. Ja čak možda ima tri.

394
00:22:16,117 --> 00:22:17,161
Savršen.

395
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,035
Znate da imamo sastanak McFeeli dolazi.

396
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,951
Želim da preuzme vođstvo.

397
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:27,017
Ozbiljno?

398
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,454
Mislim, hvala. Da.

399
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:31,567
To će značiti mnogo sati. Mogu li oni.

400
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:33,525
Odlično.

401
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:38,898
Moram reći, da ste kreativni Rockstar.

402
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:43,642
Ne mogu vam opisati koliko
sam srecan ti prebačen ovde.

403
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,252
Oh, da li bi mogao.

404
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:47,646
Ali to će smanjiti u moje tri minuta.

405
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,605
Znaš šta...

406
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:51,389
zašto ne uzmete ostatak dana slobodno?

407
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:54,044
To će biti nos da GRINDSTONE
za naredne dve nedelje.

408
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:55,785
Mislim da ne moram dva puta da mi kažeš.

409
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:57,114
Vidimo se sutra onda.

410
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,465
Prva stvar.

411
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:01,336
Apsolutno.

412
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:12,323
Hej, šta ima?

413
00:23:12,347 --> 00:23:14,543
G Goldsteina krvni pritisak.

414
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:17,197
Ako niste bili toliko
zli, ti bi bio prilično.

415
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:19,461
Način na koji pričaš.

416
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:22,246
Držite Vheeling, šarmer. Ahh.

417
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,466
Čekaj, zašto me zoveš?
Da me ne zoveš iz zatvora.

418
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,859
Imam popodne.

419
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:30,341
Zbog dobrog vladanja? Da, tako nešto.

420
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:31,908
Ima li šanse da danas
možete igrati Hooki sa mnom?

421
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:33,170
Oh, ja bih.

422
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:34,693
Ja sam pomaganje na 88-iear-old-ih

423
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:37,217
žučni kamen operacija kasnije.

424
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:38,567
U pravu si sada toliko ljubomoran na mene.

425
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:40,046
Ljubomorna.

426
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,787
Ko je ljubomoran?

427
00:23:41,811 --> 00:23:43,528
Oh, sve moje prosci, gospodin Goldštajn.

428
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:46,749
Rekao sam im da je pobedio glavu i srce.

429
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:47,793
U redu, mi smo u stvari
kretanje, ili smo samo mi

430
00:23:47,817 --> 00:23:49,360
ljulja napred-nazad?

431
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:50,840
Kažem ti.

432
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:53,930
Drugi li prestati da
Iapper, ti si zadivljuje.

433
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:55,671
Oh, da me voliš.

434
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:56,695
Nah...

435
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,936
Kako to da ne zovu Chris?

436
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,416
Uh, on je na radnom skupu.

437
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,418
Oh.

438
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,421
Dobro. Pa, zabavite painting grad.

439
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,317
Misli na mene.
Laktovi duboko u žučne kese smeća.

440
00:24:13,408 --> 00:24:14,559
Šta se ti smeješ?

441
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,628
Ti. Ugh.

442
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:45,895
Hej, Lloid. To je Megan. Zdravo.

443
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,505
Vidi, ja sam se rano danas.

444
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,376
Da li, možda, želim, ja ne znam

445
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,533
provjeriti parka, ili da neki kineski?

446
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,120
Definitivno.

447
00:24:54,144 --> 00:24:58,516
Srešćemo se na patke.

448
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,998
Dakle, čujem da imaju najbolju
piletinu lo Mein u gradu.

449
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:05,262
I've been dying to try it
but no one would go with me.

450
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:07,873
Kate's always working, so...
I'll go with you.

451
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:10,093
I know, I know exactly
what you're talking about.

452
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:12,095
Yes, I mean...

453
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:15,185
It's just around the corner.
Oh, it's right over there.

454
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:17,840
I love Chinese.

455
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:20,930
I am so happy you like Chinese food.

456
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:23,410
To my perfect hooky buddy. Cheers.

457
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,764
Oh! I really needed this. Ooh! Wow.

458
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:30,592
Work has sucked so bad lately.

459
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:33,725
Aah! I'm so glad I could be of assistance.

460
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:35,945
Do you miss the old job?

461
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:37,337
Sometimes.

462
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:39,470
There was a lot more freedom there

463
00:25:39,494 --> 00:25:40,906
but not as much room for advancement.

464
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,212
Yeah.

465
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:43,648
Here, all advance

466
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:45,500
but my boss is kind of a jerk.

467
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:49,199
You should just kill him.

468
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:53,552
I should just kill him.

469
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,231
Tell you, this is definitely the most fun

470
00:26:01,255 --> 00:26:02,406
I've had since I've been here.

471
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,190
Oh, this is definitely the most fun

472
00:26:04,214 --> 00:26:05,494
I've had since you've been here.

473
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,282
Oh, my God. I think I'm drunk.

474
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:11,502
Thank God, I live only two blocks away.

475
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:13,635
Where do you live?

476
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:14,940
Two blocks away. Thank you.

477
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:16,681
What, seriously? No.

478
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:18,248
Three blocks away. Oh.

479
00:26:18,272 --> 00:26:20,511
Thank you. A-da-da.

480
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:22,861
Chivalry is not dead. Megan.

481
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:24,907
Come on, it's my pleasure.

482
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:26,931
It is nice to have someone
to hang out with today.

483
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:29,259
U redu. Hm.

484
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:30,869
Eh, ne.

485
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:32,871
Zašto? Šta...

486
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:35,215
Bogatstvo samo se ostvariti
ako imate ga neko ruku na vas.

487
00:26:36,725 --> 00:26:37,987
Da ok.

488
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:42,620
Šta?

489
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:44,100
Ti si sujeveran.

490
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:45,623
A šta je to, cudno?

491
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,364
Ne, to je divno, stvarno.

492
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:48,432
Oh.

493
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:52,567
Oh. Jednu sekundu.

494
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:56,503
Ćao dušo.

495
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:58,767
Uh, da. Ja sam zapravo sa
mojim prijateljem Lloid.

496
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:01,097
Mogu li da ti dam poziv
vrati za desetak minuta?

497
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:05,382
Dobro. Velcome home.

498
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:06,406
Zdravo.

499
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:11,693
Još jedan prijatelj? Dečko, zapravo.

500
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:15,174
Ja, mislila sam da si još uvek tuguje.

501
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:18,134
Ja sam, ali to je...

502
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:20,876
I don't know, it's been a year
and I'm ready to date again.

503
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,641
And Chris is pretty fantastic.

504
00:27:23,946 --> 00:27:25,315
That's great. Yeah.

505
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:27,186
I think you're gonna love him.

506
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,580
You know what?
We should all hang out sometime.

507
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:31,388
That would be great.

508
00:27:32,563 --> 00:27:33,782
Can't wait.

509
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:46,292
I brought you Chinese.
And don't say I never think about you.

510
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:48,860
Leftover or my own?

511
00:27:48,884 --> 00:27:50,645
I was thinking about you when I asked them

512
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,124
to pack up my leftovers.

513
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:53,952
Did Chris have fun at his lawyer thing?

514
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:55,258
Convention? Yeah.

515
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:57,042
I don't know. I have to call him.

516
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:58,304
Who'd you ended up going out with?

517
00:27:58,328 --> 00:27:59,373
Lloyd.

518
00:28:01,505 --> 00:28:04,397
My colleague from my old job, remember?

519
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:06,922
You just met him on the street.
Couch potato crew.

520
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:09,600
Oh. Right. Oh. Hm.

521
00:28:10,993 --> 00:28:13,276
And he seems kinda lonely.

522
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,625
Hm. Yeah.

523
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:15,974
And he was talking about

524
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:17,584
how he hasn't met a lot of people.

525
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,369
Hm. And I, uh...

526
00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:21,284
And I notice how you haven't exactly

527
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:23,765
been very social, so...

528
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:27,072
Seriously, Megs? Like, I have time to date?

529
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:29,814
I'll have you know,
I was proposed to twice today.

530
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:33,078
Really should have gone into
ortho instead of geriatrics.

531
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:35,080
I'm just saying,
maybe you guys could hang out sometime.

532
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:36,473
He doesn't know anyone else in town.

533
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:37,604
Meg...

534
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:39,258
I'll do your laundry for a week.

535
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:41,826
Oh, you know how I feel
about laundry. Yeah.

536
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,262
Fine, make it a month and we have a deal.

537
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:45,612
Okay, fine. Yes! Oh!

538
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:49,007
And that is when she
flipped over her kayak.

539
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:51,314
I... And I knew the second I was trapped

540
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:52,707
that this was not going to end well.

541
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,447
Look, I'm not the best swimmer

542
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:56,754
but let's just say that I got there first.

543
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:58,756
He saved my life. Yeah.

544
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,149
In four feet of water. No.

545
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:02,064
I think my pool is deeper.

546
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:05,502
I don't know.
It seemed about six feet to me.

547
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:08,505
That is the cutest story I never
wanna hear again, you guys.

548
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,942
Oh, come on, Kate.

549
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:13,379
Well, what about, uh, what about you?

550
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:15,817
I thought it was a fine story.
Little long, but...

551
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:16,841
Ah!

552
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:19,124
What? No.

553
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:20,256
I meant, how are you adjusting.

554
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,562
TCH. Fine.

555
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:24,521
Oh, Lloyd is just being very modest.

556
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:26,610
He already has a job, a place

557
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:30,135
and a knowledge of at least
two top dinning spots.

558
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,877
Mm, wait, Lloyd, you mean to tell me

559
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:34,749
that you didn't just
move in with your sister

560
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,316
for three months and then never move out?
People do that?

561
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,275
You shut up. You love me living with you.

562
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:40,798
I love you paying half my rent.

563
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:42,626
Uh, no, two-thirds your rent.

564
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,584
Well, you have a better job.
It makes more sense.

565
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:46,891
Okay, so, Lloyd, um

566
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:49,285
Megan tells me that, uh,
that you're a tech guy.

567
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:51,069
I'm a programmer.

568
00:29:51,093 --> 00:29:53,506
Oh, so can you fix computers?

569
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,465
Not the hard drive but if
you have software issues

570
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:56,945
I'm fairly handy.

571
00:29:56,969 --> 00:29:59,251
Then, I may be calling upon your talents

572
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:01,340
because my computer just hates me.

573
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:02,689
No, it doesn't hate you.

574
00:30:02,713 --> 00:30:04,953
It's just tragically out of date.

575
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:06,868
Apparently,
Chris was the only one in law school

576
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:08,739
who refused to use a laptop.

577
00:30:08,763 --> 00:30:11,698
Oh, pa, mislim da sam ok sa
mojom olovkom i svojoj beležnici.

578
00:30:11,722 --> 00:30:14,658
Oh, znači da niste imali
vaš pero i mastilo pri ruci?

579
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:17,704
Oh, da voliš moj mali pero, malo...

580
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:19,402
malo pernate pero...

581
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:22,081
Fuj! Dobro, momci, sačuvajte ga za venčanje.

582
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:25,103
Čiji venčanje?

583
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:26,670
Oh, Bruk, ona se udaje

584
00:30:26,694 --> 00:30:27,976
na vinarije do obale.

585
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,543
Jel tako. Da. Bruk.

586
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:33,111
Da, i nije mogao da dođe
u boljem trenutku previše.

587
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:35,374
Pete sam našao način da
duplira svoj obim posla.

588
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:37,333
On je kreten. Da, kapetan budala.

589
00:30:37,357 --> 00:30:39,552
On je zaista, potpuno monopol vreme

590
00:30:39,576 --> 00:30:40,945
pošto ste počeli da radite tamo.

591
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:42,164
Jedva sam je video ove nedelje.

592
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:44,166
Da, i nećemo.

593
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:47,604
We're heading into a new
project, and I'm on point.

594
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:49,214
I'm about to drop off the grid.

595
00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:51,477
So, this, you guys

596
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:55,090
you are my last taste of joy and freedom.

597
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:57,179
Thank you.

598
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:59,050
Cheers. I'm so proud of you.

599
00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:00,095
That's... Thank you.

600
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,337
Congrats, baby.

601
00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:16,875
Oh!

602
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:21,159
Hello. Hej, mama.

603
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:23,727
Hi, baby. I miss you.

604
00:31:23,751 --> 00:31:26,512
I miss you more.

605
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:28,688
How's the job search?

606
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:30,125
Yeah, it's going okay.

607
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:33,868
And your girlfriend? Good. Really good.

608
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,653
We had a fancy dinner tonight. Oh.

609
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:40,831
Well, take your time, baby.
Women like romance.

610
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:42,833
Don't tell her you love her.

611
00:31:42,857 --> 00:31:44,990
Show her you love her.

612
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:48,795
Remember, baby, love is an...

613
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:50,667
An action.

614
00:31:50,691 --> 00:31:51,973
Yes, mama.

615
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:52,997
I know.

616
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:01,808
Megan's desk is straight down
the hallway to the right.

617
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:03,530
Great. Thank you.

618
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:11,253
Hej, stranger. Lloyd?

619
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:14,821
You forgot. Oh, shoot. No.

620
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:16,998
Uh, yes. I mean, yeah, I did.

621
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:19,174
It's just been really crazy here today.

622
00:32:19,198 --> 00:32:21,350
No worries. It was just lunch.

623
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:23,334
The poppers at Gino's are
all-you-can-eat though.

624
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,791
I'm an idiot. I'm so sorry, I can't.

625
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:29,880
I promise I'll make it up to you.

626
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:31,490
My boss is being such a tool.

627
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:33,579
I've had to redo this
spreadsheet three times

628
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:35,277
and the presentation is next week.

629
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:38,628
Hm. Really, don't, don't worry.
We'll rain check.

630
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:40,045
Okay. Hej, Megan.

631
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:46,268
Ah.

632
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:52,579
Didn't realize you had time for friends.

633
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,601
Thought you'd be...

634
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,410
I am. I'm on it.

635
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,696
Good. I'll leave you to it then.

636
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,941
I'm headed to lunch.
I expect your revisions when I get back.

637
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:19,345
Uh... Okay, then.

638
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,349
Call me when you're free. Yeah, I will.

639
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:45,414
Oh. Oh, look.

640
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:52,219
I'm all sweaty.
You'll know when you kiss me.

641
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:57,402
God, I needed this.

642
00:33:57,426 --> 00:33:59,230
I want this moment to last forever.

643
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:02,364
I do not wanna go back to work.

644
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:04,496
No. No, no, no. No work talk.

645
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,000
You promised me.

646
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:08,587
Two more days.

647
00:34:08,611 --> 00:34:11,503
Just two more days.
That's literally all I can think about.

648
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:13,201
Really?

649
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:14,922
'Cause I'm thinking it's seven more days.

650
00:34:15,444 --> 00:34:17,379
Why?

651
00:34:17,403 --> 00:34:20,512
It's our weekend. Yes.

652
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:22,364
Seven more days.

653
00:34:23,278 --> 00:34:25,193
God, I love you.

654
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:29,086
Oh, my God. Is that weird? Did I...

655
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,218
Did I just make that weird?

656
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:31,567
I... It just flew out

657
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:32,959
and I wasn't thinking but...

658
00:34:34,463 --> 00:34:36,659
I don't wanna take it back or...

659
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:38,293
I love you, too.

660
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,107
I like you.

661
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,159
Ultimately,
we believe our product will not only

662
00:34:58,183 --> 00:35:01,640
increase consumer sales,
it will give you an entry

663
00:35:01,664 --> 00:35:03,947
into the industrial market as well.

664
00:35:03,971 --> 00:35:07,037
The market that has
previously been unattainable

665
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:08,473
because of the foreign underpricing

666
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:11,346
which you will now undercut.

667
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,349
It's the right move at the right time.

668
00:35:14,373 --> 00:35:16,438
That was such a great presentation.

669
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:19,180
It's perfect. It's exactly
what we've been talking about.

670
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:22,226
Oh, my God!

671
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,925
That was amazing. You were amazing.

672
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:28,450
Thank you. I, I feel great.

673
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:30,650
Znaš šta to znači. Promocija?

674
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:33,194
Prerano.

675
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:38,373
To znači da se dugo,
dugo odnos sa ovom kompanijom.

676
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:41,051
Ovo je fenomenalna!

677
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:53,499
Proslava koktel?

678
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,001
Uh, ne. U stvari, ja, moram da idem kući.

679
00:35:58,025 --> 00:36:00,656
Znate, stvarno treba imati pića ponekad.

680
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,813
Možemo da razgovaramo o
tvom napredovanje potencijal.

681
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:07,184
Naravno.

682
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,143
Znate, mi takođe može
učiniti u kancelariji.

683
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,233
U svako doba tokom ručka. U kancelariji.

684
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:13,843
Treba prevoz? Uh, ne, hvala.

685
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:15,149
Imam svoj auto.

686
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,455
Megan? Da.

687
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:19,370
Stvarno sjajan posao.

688
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:22,919
Čim se vratim iz Sijetla,
hajde da razgovaramo.

689
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:19,691
To je samo virus. Ništa strašno.

690
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:21,606
Trebalo bi da bude prilično lako obrisati.

691
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,434
Seriously?

692
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,982
How lucky am I that Megan's
new friend is techie?

693
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:28,594
So lucky.

694
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:34,315
So, I hyper-sensitized the drive

695
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:35,838
in case something like this happens again.

696
00:37:35,862 --> 00:37:37,709
There's an alert that'll show up.

697
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:39,972
You'll be able to stop it
from doing any more damage.

698
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:42,192
You're a good man.

699
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:43,976
I know.

700
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,611
Thank you.

701
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:51,375
No problem. That's what I do.

702
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:52,661
Well, it's impressive.

703
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,120
Kate, how many black t-shirts

704
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:58,687
do you actually need for one weekend?

705
00:37:58,711 --> 00:38:00,210
Seven.

706
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:01,820
Other than your hideous bridesmaid's dress.

707
00:38:01,844 --> 00:38:03,344
Hideous.

708
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:04,867
Unflattering to every shape and size.

709
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:06,303
Were you aware of how much

710
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:08,262
Brooke really hates you?

711
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,307
You really only need pajamas.

712
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:14,268
Then again,
you might not even need those. Wink.

713
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,488
Okay, two t-shirts, need those shorts.

714
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:20,012
Wedding stuff and pajamas.

715
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:21,971
I'm a nurse. I know.

716
00:38:21,995 --> 00:38:24,276
Trust me, Chris probably hasn't
even started packing yet.

717
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,542
This is mine.

718
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:29,370
Please. Fine.

719
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:31,372
Thank you. Didn't even ask.

720
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:32,938
I don't have to.

721
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:37,378
I wish I had your, um...

722
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:39,491
comfortability with technology.

723
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:44,385
Well, uh, it's just a matter of jumping in.

724
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:46,529
Not letting fear stop you
from getting what you want.

725
00:38:49,022 --> 00:38:50,956
Right.

726
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,741
Yeah, I don't seem to have that problem

727
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:56,397
with any other aspect of my
life, uh, just computers.

728
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:59,400
You want me to climb the
mountain or charm a client

729
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:02,577
I'm your guy, but, uh, technology, man.

730
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:07,780
Well, not everything can just
be so easily handed to everyone.

731
00:39:11,131 --> 00:39:13,544
Well, I-I wasn't saying, uh...

732
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:15,024
That's not, that's not what I meant.

733
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:18,723
Um, you know what, I wasn't saying any...

734
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:19,942
That was, like, easy... You know what?

735
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:22,403
Um... I gotta go.

736
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:25,817
Wait, what? Whoa, hej.

737
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:27,819
Wait, h-hold on a sec, did...

738
00:39:27,843 --> 00:39:29,473
Did I offend you in some... No.

739
00:39:29,497 --> 00:39:30,779
You didn't. Really, it's okay.

740
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:33,066
I just... Never mind.

741
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:35,827
I have to go. Okay...

742
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:37,699
Okay, I got some roofing
stuff to do anyway.

743
00:39:37,723 --> 00:39:39,725
Um, hej, thank you.

744
00:39:40,465 --> 00:39:41,553
Got it.

745
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:44,730
See ya. Yep.

746
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:52,583
Âª She was sexy like it's nothing âª.

747
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:56,282
Wine? Is it six o'clock?

748
00:39:56,306 --> 00:39:57,917
In Paraguay.

749
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:02,463
Thank you. Mm-hm.

750
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:07,206
So, in today's news,
I told Chris that I loved him.

751
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,252
Do you?

752
00:40:09,276 --> 00:40:11,602
Of course. That's a weird question.

753
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:13,604
Well, I'm a weird person.

754
00:40:13,628 --> 00:40:15,127
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

755
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:18,024
Wow, I've not been in love in forever.

756
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:21,264
You will, you will find love.

757
00:40:21,288 --> 00:40:24,485
You are so smart and gorgeous.
Mm, it's a curse.

758
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:27,183
What about Lloyd? Seriously? No.

759
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:29,185
Why not? He is not my type.

760
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:31,709
I thought your type was, upright bi-ped?

761
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:34,277
Da, to je, i druge podatke, kao, humora.

762
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:36,453
Posao. Lojd ima posao.

763
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:37,628
Da, ali ne.

764
00:40:37,652 --> 00:40:39,108
Mislim da bi se napraviti...

765
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:40,283
Dobro, Megan zaustavi.

766
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:42,024
Ja, ja sam odrasla žena.

767
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:43,808
Ja mogu izabrati svoje udvarače.

768
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:46,507
"Potencijalni kupci?" Ozbiljno?

769
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:49,858
Da li će ih zabavljati
na terasi sa Mint Julep?

770
00:40:49,882 --> 00:40:51,882
Zaboravio si moj komešanje
i fensi ventilator ruke.

771
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:54,103
Kad smo kod toga...

772
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:58,432
Kako je cenio dobar Segue za pranje veša?

773
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,782
Zato što sam fan radite svoj veš.

774
00:41:00,806 --> 00:41:02,486
Oh, vidi šta sam uradio tamo? Ne, ne znam.

775
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:04,742
Radim na tome.

776
00:41:04,766 --> 00:41:06,483
Imao si tri slobodna dana rada.

777
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:08,485
Kako ste nije imala vremena da veš?

778
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:11,619
I was decompressing.
This was a big deal that we closed.

779
00:41:11,643 --> 00:41:13,708
How is Mr. Personality? Pete?

780
00:41:13,732 --> 00:41:15,884
Mm-hm. Ugh, I've no idea.

781
00:41:15,908 --> 00:41:18,887
Uh, he's headed to Seattle to
dot the I's and cross the T's.

782
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:21,280
And when the cat's away... The mouse...

783
00:41:21,304 --> 00:41:23,152
Do her sister's damn laundry.

784
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:25,720
Ew! Gross.

785
00:41:25,744 --> 00:41:27,548
It's not that... Ew! Uh, it's gross.

786
00:41:27,572 --> 00:41:29,182
That's gross. Sorry.

787
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,152
It was always my favorite place as a kid.

788
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:10,547
Mm, me too. All those rooms.

789
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:13,594
I used to pretend like we lived
in some remote place in England.

790
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:15,421
Like "Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe."

791
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:16,988
But every time I opened up those closets

792
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:18,903
there were just itchy, old coats.

793
00:42:18,927 --> 00:42:20,668
No talking lions or evil witches.

794
00:42:22,757 --> 00:42:25,649
Someday, I'm gonna buy a
Victorian like grandma did.

795
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:29,784
Fix it up. Give my kids a
place to explore and imagine.

796
00:42:29,808 --> 00:42:32,917
And your spinster sister Kate.
Don't forget about me.

797
00:42:32,941 --> 00:42:34,552
Okay, you can have your own wing.

798
00:42:38,643 --> 00:42:41,360
Hm. I don't know this number.
No, that's the hospital.

799
00:42:41,384 --> 00:42:42,777
Pick that up.

800
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:45,693
Hello?

801
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:48,367
Oh, my God!

802
00:42:48,391 --> 00:42:49,958
Hi. What happened?

803
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:53,242
I fell.

804
00:42:53,266 --> 00:42:56,985
Fell. It's a...
it's a funny, funny, funny word.

805
00:42:57,009 --> 00:42:59,596
Okay, what is happening?

806
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,380
He's on a morphine drip.

807
00:43:01,404 --> 00:43:03,426
Apparently,
he had an accident with a ladder

808
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,776
and... the ladder won.

809
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,866
Oh, my God, baby. I am so sorry.

810
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,738
Gosh! Is-is there anything I could do?

811
00:43:10,762 --> 00:43:13,175
Yeah. Yeah. Um...

812
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,701
You know that, you know that
movie we watched with the...

813
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:20,312
with the chair in the
water and the Sp-splash?

814
00:43:20,336 --> 00:43:23,446
Yeah. Dancing...

815
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,274
Do you wanna do... You wanna dance, Megsy?

816
00:43:25,298 --> 00:43:27,668
Mm-hm. Yeah.

817
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:29,583
Okay, on second thought, maybe we, uh

818
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,846
repack those granny PJs...

819
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,306
Megsy.

820
00:43:38,703 --> 00:43:40,443
So pretty. Thank you.

821
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:42,532
Wow!

822
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,077
Maybe she'll understand.

823
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:48,253
She absolutely will not understand.

824
00:43:48,277 --> 00:43:50,125
This is Brooke we're talking about.

825
00:43:50,149 --> 00:43:51,343
She wouldn't talk to you for a month

826
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:52,388
after you missed her birthday.

827
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:53,998
And it was her 26 th.

828
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:55,870
That's not even a special birthday.

829
00:43:55,894 --> 00:43:57,567
And it was at a bar.

830
00:43:57,591 --> 00:44:00,135
Her wedding, no,
you're going or you're done.

831
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:01,876
Please, please, please, come with me.

832
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,660
I would but I can't, I'm covering a double

833
00:44:03,684 --> 00:44:06,794
on Saturday,
and this double's covering the-the...

834
00:44:06,818 --> 00:44:10,667
I just can't because I suck,
but I'll look in on Chris

835
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:13,583
for you, and I'll only
borrow half your clothes.

836
00:44:13,607 --> 00:44:15,411
Ugh, I hate going to weddings alone.

837
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:17,195
Oni su tako depresivno.

838
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:18,980
I, oh, Bože, buket baci.

839
00:44:19,004 --> 00:44:20,111
Da li se šališ na moj račun?

840
00:44:20,135 --> 00:44:21,243
Moram nekoga da mi pomogne

841
00:44:21,267 --> 00:44:22,374
ismijavati tih ljudi.

842
00:44:22,398 --> 00:44:24,139
Ne mogu da budem jedan od tih ljudi.

843
00:44:25,793 --> 00:44:26,901
Mogu da slomim nogu. Ja ću slomiti nogu.

844
00:44:26,925 --> 00:44:29,251
O, ne, ne. Shvatio sam.

845
00:44:29,275 --> 00:44:30,644
Šta, možeš ići? Ne.

846
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,733
Ali možete uzeti svoj
novi najboljeg prijatelja.

847
00:44:32,757 --> 00:44:34,473
Lojd? Da. Što da ne?

848
00:44:34,497 --> 00:44:37,085
Mislim, očigledno je
taj tip je tako usamljen.

849
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:38,739
Mislim, vikend bijeg? Hajde.

850
00:44:38,763 --> 00:44:41,219
Vaš mamac je ovde. To ne izgleda čudno?

851
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:44,005
Tražeći od njega da venčanje. Vikend odmor.

852
00:44:44,029 --> 00:44:45,702
Ne, mislim da će raditi savršeno.

853
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:48,618
Mislim, ti kao da si sa njim, i...

854
00:44:48,642 --> 00:44:50,881
Maybe he'll hook up with someone
at the wedding, you know.

855
00:44:50,905 --> 00:44:52,753
Weddings are filled with desperate people.

856
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:55,756
I mean, maybe he'll get lucky
and then you can leave me alone

857
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,740
with my geriatric patients
and cat-filled future.

858
00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:01,529
Which is actually a lot
more fun than it sounds.

859
00:45:05,615 --> 00:45:06,897
Kate, where are you?

860
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:08,769
Captain Slavedriver is still AWOL

861
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:11,075
so I don't know if I even
need to go in to work today.

862
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:12,120
Call me back.

863
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,388
Hej, you. Hej.

864
00:45:19,412 --> 00:45:20,781
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

865
00:45:20,805 --> 00:45:21,999
No, I'm actually just about

866
00:45:22,023 --> 00:45:23,958
to go visit Chris at the hospital.

867
00:45:23,982 --> 00:45:26,003
Why? What happened?

868
00:45:26,027 --> 00:45:29,006
He fell off his ladder yesterday
and broke his arm and his leg.

869
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:32,880
Oh, žao mi je. To je užasno, ja...

870
00:45:32,904 --> 00:45:35,080
Ima li išta mogu da uradim?

871
00:45:37,038 --> 00:45:39,737
U stvari, kad bolje razmislim...

872
00:45:41,434 --> 00:45:43,131
Kako se osećate u vezi venčanja?

873
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:53,683
Ćao dušo. Zdravo, mama.

874
00:45:53,707 --> 00:45:55,424
Kako ide sa Megan?

875
00:45:55,448 --> 00:45:57,643
To se na kraju događa.

876
00:45:57,667 --> 00:45:59,733
Odlazimo zajedno ovaj vikend.

877
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:04,085
To je to. Znam to. Grand gestovi, dušo.

878
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:06,914
Nešto što nikada neću zaboraviti.

879
00:46:06,938 --> 00:46:09,723
OK, mama. Mislim da imam plan.

880
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:13,834
Dobro, ja ću pogledati u na Chris svaki dan

881
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:15,618
ali ne mogu da obećam da neću pisati

882
00:46:15,642 --> 00:46:19,100
njegov šašav morfin brbljaju na
svim društvenim medijima svuda.

883
00:46:19,124 --> 00:46:22,886
Hvala vam.
Ako za gleda u, ne za eksploataciju.

884
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:25,802
Oh, hm, ali ako radi smešne
akcente, definitivno post.

885
00:46:25,826 --> 00:46:27,001
Da. Hvala.

886
00:46:30,396 --> 00:46:32,766
Are you sure it's okay that I'm doing this?

887
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,464
I feel like such an ass.
I feel like I should be here.

888
00:46:35,488 --> 00:46:37,683
What? It's fine.
There's nothing to do here.

889
00:46:37,707 --> 00:46:39,207
Except work too hard.

890
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:41,426
Watch your goofy boyfriend battle pudding

891
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:44,821
and lose your best friend.
So, go, have fun. Relax.

892
00:46:44,845 --> 00:46:46,518
Okay.

893
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:47,979
You're right.

894
00:46:52,897 --> 00:46:55,266
You okay? Yeah, sure. Fine.

895
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:58,728
Just, um... be careful. Okay?

896
00:47:01,514 --> 00:47:02,839
There's a lot of crazy
dancers at the wedding

897
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:04,885
you could take an elbow
to that pretty face.

898
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:07,801
Only if it's my own. Okay.

899
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,280
Bye. Call me, text me every day.

900
00:47:09,304 --> 00:47:10,586
I will. I have no life.

901
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:12,588
I know. I know that.

902
00:47:12,612 --> 00:47:14,285
Hello. Hej.

903
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:15,417
Thank you. I'm so excited.

904
00:47:15,441 --> 00:47:16,659
Seems so fun. Me too.

905
00:47:18,357 --> 00:47:20,157
Here, let me get this for you.
Oh, thank you.

906
00:47:21,055 --> 00:47:22,709
That's very kind.

907
00:47:24,537 --> 00:47:27,235
Âª So sooner or later âª.

908
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,172
I am completely tone-deaf.

909
00:47:31,196 --> 00:47:34,479
Completely, but points for enthusiasm.

910
00:47:34,503 --> 00:47:36,220
You, on the other hand, Mr. Murrow

911
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:37,308
have perfect pitch.

912
00:47:37,332 --> 00:47:39,484
Ah. Well, I-I was in glee club.

913
00:47:39,508 --> 00:47:41,225
Ah. Of course you were.

914
00:47:41,249 --> 00:47:42,836
Your parents were hell-bent on securing

915
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,600
your virginity, weren't they?

916
00:47:46,341 --> 00:47:48,213
I am so sorry. I was joking.

917
00:47:49,127 --> 00:47:50,800
No, it's okay.

918
00:47:50,824 --> 00:47:53,281
Uh, m-my mother put me in
computer club to make smart

919
00:47:53,305 --> 00:47:55,465
friends and glee club so I
could sing to her at night.

920
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:04,707
It's actually kinda sweet.

921
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:07,251
What about your dad?

922
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:09,321
You mentioned he, he passed away.

923
00:48:11,192 --> 00:48:13,997
You remembered. Of course.

924
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:16,870
"There's no protocol for grief."

925
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,634
Wise words from a wise man.

926
00:48:19,635 --> 00:48:21,483
Thank you.

927
00:48:21,507 --> 00:48:23,528
If I'm prying, you can,
you can tell me to shut up.

928
00:48:23,552 --> 00:48:26,314
No, it's... It's okay.

929
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:28,969
My dad had an accident when I was ten.

930
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:32,146
What kind of accident?
If you don't mind me asking.

931
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:33,538
Again, I really don't want to pry.

932
00:48:33,562 --> 00:48:34,975
It's alright, really.

933
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:36,739
You're curious. It's nice.

934
00:48:38,654 --> 00:48:41,590
I found him,
he fell down a flight of stairs.

935
00:48:41,614 --> 00:48:44,617
Broke his neck. It was awful.

936
00:48:46,488 --> 00:48:48,882
My God! And you were ten?

937
00:48:50,405 --> 00:48:52,470
That must've been terrible for you.

938
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:54,342
Just been me and mother ever since.

939
00:48:54,366 --> 00:48:56,566
She's definitely been both
a mother and a father to me.

940
00:48:57,282 --> 00:48:59,260
That's great.

941
00:48:59,284 --> 00:49:01,827
I would love to meet her one day.

942
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:04,463
You would? Sure.

943
00:49:09,337 --> 00:49:12,186
Don't you just love the smell of the ocean?

944
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,884
That must mean we're close.

945
00:49:14,908 --> 00:49:17,955
Oh, look, we are. There's the hotel.

946
00:49:27,442 --> 00:49:29,488
We're here. Yay!

947
00:49:32,056 --> 00:49:33,120
Hi.

948
00:49:33,144 --> 00:49:35,426
Hi. Oh. Oh.

949
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:37,951
Oh, you look amazing. Right?

950
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,474
I've been on a liquid diet for three weeks

951
00:49:39,498 --> 00:49:41,128
to fit into my dress.

952
00:49:41,152 --> 00:49:42,999
Is this the famous Chris? Hi.

953
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:44,653
Uh, no, this is actually...

954
00:49:44,677 --> 00:49:47,656
Wait, I know you. You're the techie.

955
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,701
Lloyd Murrow. Uh, we used to work together.

956
00:49:49,725 --> 00:49:54,054
Jel tako. Jel tako. Ćao. Da.
Zašto si ovde? Gde je Kris?

957
00:49:54,078 --> 00:49:55,533
Oh, to je duga priča. Duga priča.

958
00:49:55,557 --> 00:49:56,839
Jink. Duguješ mi kokain.

959
00:50:00,432 --> 00:50:02,540
Oh, vait, Kris slomio nogu

960
00:50:02,564 --> 00:50:04,847
i Lojd je moj vitez u sjajnom oklopu

961
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:07,395
tako da ne moraju da se
druže sa svojim kućnim solo.

962
00:50:09,397 --> 00:50:10,896
Pa, onda, hvala, Lloid

963
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,463
za pazeći moj bestie stigao.

964
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:13,377
Jer ja bih apsolutno je ubio

965
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:14,401
ako nije.

966
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,144
To je ono što prijatelji.

967
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:20,906
Idemo!

968
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:22,019
Nabaviću, doneću...

969
00:50:23,194 --> 00:50:24,847
Oh... Ok.

970
00:50:29,983 --> 00:50:31,830
Oh. Da li se šališ na moj račun?

971
00:50:31,854 --> 00:50:33,876
Nema šanse da radimo ovu večeru trezan.

972
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,226
Shvataš moja majka će biti tamo, zar ne?

973
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,904
Well, bottoms up.

974
00:50:43,823 --> 00:50:46,391
So... Lloyd?

975
00:50:47,479 --> 00:50:49,457
No. Ratchet it back.

976
00:50:49,481 --> 00:50:51,111
"Jinx. You owe me a coke."

977
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:53,722
What is that? Super flirty.

978
00:50:53,746 --> 00:50:56,116
Okay, yeah, if you're in the fourth grade.

979
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,707
Even defensive. Delusional.

980
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:04,428
So, Lloyd... Wait, which one is Lloyd?

981
00:51:04,452 --> 00:51:07,214
Nerdy techie. Oh, he's super cute.

982
00:51:07,238 --> 00:51:09,694
And super single. Oh.

983
00:51:09,718 --> 00:51:12,219
He's only a friend and he's
the only reason I got here.

984
00:51:12,243 --> 00:51:15,787
In fact, if you're into intellectual man

985
00:51:15,811 --> 00:51:17,659
I would... And look his way.

986
00:51:17,683 --> 00:51:19,922
Oh, I'm all for it.

987
00:51:19,946 --> 00:51:22,707
At least for tonight, anyway.

988
00:51:22,731 --> 00:51:25,928
Look, yes, please.
He needs all the help he can get.

989
00:51:25,952 --> 00:51:29,149
Okay, then, here is to Lloyd getting laid.

990
00:51:29,173 --> 00:51:30,304
Mm-hm. Yes.

991
00:51:32,567 --> 00:51:35,546
I except the very best out of you ladies.

992
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:38,375
Please, do it for us. The engaged.

993
00:51:38,399 --> 00:51:40,508
The shackled. The done.

994
00:51:42,316 --> 00:51:43,859
Here is to being done. Being done.

995
00:51:45,841 --> 00:51:47,452
Ohh... Mm.

996
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,171
Oh, we gotta go. Come on. Downstairs.

997
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:52,302
I'm changing my dress.

998
00:51:52,326 --> 00:51:53,521
We gotta go. Let's go. Let's go.

999
00:51:53,545 --> 00:51:54,545
Oh, I'm so excited.

1000
00:52:00,421 --> 00:52:03,531
Ca... Can you believe her mother-in-law?

1001
00:52:03,555 --> 00:52:05,750
I mean...

1002
00:52:05,774 --> 00:52:08,144
W-wait, so...
Wait, you don't like being asked

1003
00:52:08,168 --> 00:52:10,190
your age and marital status
four times over the first court?

1004
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:13,018
Ugh, it was really, really embarrassing.

1005
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:17,327
Oh, thank God she moved on to...

1006
00:52:17,351 --> 00:52:19,416
Xander the third.

1007
00:52:21,703 --> 00:52:22,854
She's marrying a third.

1008
00:52:22,878 --> 00:52:24,291
That is just so sad.

1009
00:52:24,315 --> 00:52:25,944
Right?

1010
00:52:25,968 --> 00:52:27,381
Well, thank God for his deplorable past

1011
00:52:27,405 --> 00:52:29,905
as an English major.

1012
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:31,800
He makes your decrepit age a non-issue.

1013
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:37,110
Oh, God, you're great.

1014
00:52:39,808 --> 00:52:42,961
Thank you. No, I'm serious.

1015
00:52:42,985 --> 00:52:44,615
I don't have a lot of friends that...

1016
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:46,400
Well, I don't have any friends.

1017
00:52:46,424 --> 00:52:48,402
What I'm saying is

1018
00:52:48,426 --> 00:52:50,534
I don't have a lot of
friends that I can talk to.

1019
00:52:50,558 --> 00:52:52,299
You're really, really easy to talk to.

1020
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:01,415
Megan, I...

1021
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:03,112
Oh, my gosh. Do you smell that?

1022
00:53:03,136 --> 00:53:04,572
The jasmine.

1023
00:53:05,617 --> 00:53:06,724
Oh. Yeah.

1024
00:53:06,748 --> 00:53:08,030
It reminds me of when

1025
00:53:08,054 --> 00:53:10,250
we used to spend summers at my grandma's.

1026
00:53:10,274 --> 00:53:12,687
Kate and I were just talking about

1027
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:15,037
how special my grandma's house was.

1028
00:53:15,061 --> 00:53:16,778
Really?

1029
00:53:16,802 --> 00:53:18,107
Tell me about it. Okay.

1030
00:53:19,457 --> 00:53:22,305
It was, it was a Victorian house

1031
00:53:22,329 --> 00:53:26,004
with high ceilings and slanted roofs.

1032
00:53:26,028 --> 00:53:27,639
Ah! It was so magical.

1033
00:53:29,728 --> 00:53:32,576
It was then that I knew that,
that's, that's the house

1034
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,733
that I ultimately raise my family in.

1035
00:53:35,951 --> 00:53:37,344
I have one.

1036
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,802
What? A Victorian.

1037
00:53:40,826 --> 00:53:42,978
It's not as big but
it's got the same bones.

1038
00:53:43,002 --> 00:53:45,937
The Victorian. Yes,
slanted roof and everything. It's great.

1039
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:47,417
Shut up.

1040
00:53:47,441 --> 00:53:49,138
You shut up.

1041
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:57,210
Mm. Well, I should get
some rest for tomorrow.

1042
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,106
I gotta make sure I soak my
dentures for the big day.

1043
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:06,393
Ako želite samo da se udam za
tebe, tako Mama Načini će odstupi.

1044
00:54:06,417 --> 00:54:09,222
Šta? Ništa.

1045
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,788
Uh, hajde, bako, idemo te kući

1046
00:54:10,812 --> 00:54:11,833
pre nego što kuk daje se.

1047
00:54:11,857 --> 00:54:13,119
Oh, u redu.

1048
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:18,579
Upoznao sam Ksander kada
je došao u moju zabavu

1049
00:54:18,603 --> 00:54:21,190
i počeo Kongu, a to je kad sam znao.

1050
00:54:21,214 --> 00:54:24,846
Bruk je bio suviše dobar za Ksander.

1051
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:26,674
Ali ozbiljno, svako ko vidi kako on pleše.

1052
00:54:26,698 --> 00:54:28,613
Ne može nikako žele da ponovo žive da.

1053
00:54:29,788 --> 00:54:32,854
Brooke i Ksander...

1054
00:54:32,878 --> 00:54:34,769
mai njihov brak poslednja

1055
00:54:34,793 --> 00:54:37,274
najmanje dva puta onoliko dugo
koliko njihovog angažovanja.

1056
00:54:39,798 --> 00:54:41,950
I oni mogu plesati na zajedno

1057
00:54:41,974 --> 00:54:44,561
sa svojim tragičnim odsustvo ritma

1058
00:54:44,585 --> 00:54:46,195
mnogo dana i noći.

1059
00:55:01,733 --> 00:55:03,798
I'd like to toast the bride and groom.

1060
00:55:03,822 --> 00:55:04,755
Lloyd, really, what are you doing?

1061
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:05,843
But mostly

1062
00:55:05,867 --> 00:55:07,889
I'd just like to toast love.

1063
00:55:07,913 --> 00:55:09,543
Brooke and Xander have found it.

1064
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,893
Many of us are still looking for it.

1065
00:55:11,917 --> 00:55:13,634
An elusive emotion

1066
00:55:13,658 --> 00:55:16,724
that so many are not
fortunate to ever experience.

1067
00:55:16,748 --> 00:55:20,031
But today, we all get to bear
witness to love as it should be.

1068
00:55:20,055 --> 00:55:22,667
Pure, honest, heartfelt.

1069
00:55:24,886 --> 00:55:27,822
Four years ago, when I started
working at Reynard Global Tech.

1070
00:55:27,846 --> 00:55:29,954
I met Megan Libby.

1071
00:55:29,978 --> 00:55:32,087
She was, uh, a creative director

1072
00:55:32,111 --> 00:55:35,395
I was just a tech nerd,
but she was always so kind

1073
00:55:35,419 --> 00:55:36,700
and smart, and funny.

1074
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,399
Yeah, she-she's the kind of girl

1075
00:55:39,423 --> 00:55:40,704
who'd talk to anybody no matter

1076
00:55:40,728 --> 00:55:42,556
how low you were on the food chain.

1077
00:55:44,906 --> 00:55:46,710
It's important to start
relationships off as friends

1078
00:55:46,734 --> 00:55:50,235
and Megan and I were friends first.

1079
00:55:50,259 --> 00:55:53,456
Oh, he's so romantic.

1080
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,330
But recently, I've felt more
than a friendship for Megan.

1081
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,507
This place, Brooke and Xander's love.

1082
00:56:00,531 --> 00:56:02,770
Uh, it's just made it
overwhelmingly clear to me

1083
00:56:02,794 --> 00:56:04,883
that I wanna get to know this woman better.

1084
00:56:06,537 --> 00:56:08,321
To be more than friends.

1085
00:56:10,279 --> 00:56:12,606
So, uh, in addition to
toasting the bride and groom

1086
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:14,390
on everlasting happiness

1087
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:16,373
please toast Megan Libby.

1088
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:21,421
With whom I intend to
explore the possibilities.

1089
00:56:29,777 --> 00:56:30,996
Excuse me.

1090
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:40,658
Megan? Megan?

1091
00:56:46,098 --> 00:56:47,945
Megan, you're being ridiculous.

1092
00:56:47,969 --> 00:56:50,208
Yeah. Are you kidding me?

1093
00:56:50,232 --> 00:56:52,994
You just humiliated me in
front of my best friend.

1094
00:56:53,018 --> 00:56:55,257
Not to mention,
hijacked my best friend's wedding.

1095
00:56:55,281 --> 00:56:56,345
I was just sharing my feelings.

1096
00:56:56,369 --> 00:56:58,565
Again, hijacked.

1097
00:56:58,589 --> 00:56:59,827
This is Brooke's wedding

1098
00:56:59,851 --> 00:57:02,656
and you made it about your feelings?

1099
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,135
Ugh!

1100
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:06,921
Utterly mortifying, not to mention...

1101
00:57:06,945 --> 00:57:09,619
selfish a-and awkward.

1102
00:57:09,643 --> 00:57:11,708
I mean, you toasted about your feelings

1103
00:57:11,732 --> 00:57:14,319
that I had no idea about.

1104
00:57:14,343 --> 00:57:16,800
Lloyd, I don't feel that way about you.

1105
00:57:16,824 --> 00:57:18,522
How do you know? Ugh. No.

1106
00:57:20,219 --> 00:57:24,068
I love Chris. I don't love you, Lloyd.

1107
00:57:24,092 --> 00:57:26,636
Look, you've been a great
friend, but this...

1108
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:29,857
Uh-uh. This is wrong on every level.

1109
00:57:29,881 --> 00:57:33,426
I've never had those kind
of feelings for you. Never.

1110
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,864
And look, I apologize if I...

1111
00:57:36,888 --> 00:57:38,866
somehow misconstrued our friendship.

1112
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:42,739
But, Lloyd, I only like you as a friend.

1113
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:45,350
Maybe you, maybe you just need time.

1114
00:57:45,374 --> 00:57:48,203
Maybe you have feelings for me
that you haven't accepted yet.

1115
00:57:48,987 --> 00:57:50,641
No. I don't.

1116
00:57:54,035 --> 00:57:55,820
Uh, I changed my look for you.

1117
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,713
Šta? Moja kosa i moja odeća.

1118
00:57:59,737 --> 00:58:03,717
Ugh! To je suludo. Rekao sam majci o tebi.

1119
00:58:03,741 --> 00:58:05,109
Zašto? Volim te.

1120
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:08,025
Zaustaviti. Lojd.

1121
00:58:08,049 --> 00:58:10,854
Ne znam kako da ti kažem, osim veoma sporo

1122
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:13,727
tako da me čuju i razumeju.

1123
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:17,948
Nemam tu vrstu osećanja prema tebi.

1124
00:58:17,972 --> 00:58:21,169
Nije potisnuto, ne neotkriveni.

1125
00:58:21,193 --> 00:58:25,652
Ne podsvesno... uopšte.

1126
00:58:25,676 --> 00:58:27,218
Tvoj prevoz je stigao.

1127
00:58:27,242 --> 00:58:29,070
Barem da te odvezem kući, Megan.

1128
00:58:31,638 --> 00:58:33,553
Mislim da bi bilo jako loša ideja.

1129
00:58:35,207 --> 00:58:37,011
Oboje nam je potrebno malo vremena
osim, ​​u redu?

1130
00:58:37,035 --> 00:58:39,733
I treba da me čuju i razumeju.

1131
00:58:52,224 --> 00:58:54,898
Ćao dušo. Hej, mama.

1132
00:58:54,922 --> 00:58:56,204
Kako si znao da sam ja?

1133
00:58:56,228 --> 00:58:59,816
To je uvek ti, dušo.

1134
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,538
How was the wedding? Good.

1135
00:59:02,669 --> 00:59:04,255
You're lying.

1136
00:59:04,279 --> 00:59:05,735
I don't think she feels the same way

1137
00:59:05,759 --> 00:59:07,476
about me as I feel about her.

1138
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,260
Of course she does.

1139
00:59:09,284 --> 00:59:11,654
You moved all the way out there for her.

1140
00:59:11,678 --> 00:59:13,506
Away from your mother.

1141
00:59:16,683 --> 00:59:19,575
I do, I do believe she does love me.

1142
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,124
She just needs... time to realize it.

1143
00:59:28,086 --> 00:59:31,239
Bože, nedostajao si mi.

1144
00:59:31,263 --> 00:59:35,373
Ne mogu da verujem da je Lojd
se ispostavilo da takav psiho.

1145
00:59:35,397 --> 00:59:36,766
Mislim, ne baš pomoći

1146
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,507
da sam sve hovelled do sada

1147
00:59:38,531 --> 00:59:42,424
ali ja bih da razgovaram s
njim, stvarno teško.

1148
00:59:42,448 --> 00:59:44,600
Jednostavno, Caveman, on je bezopasan.

1149
00:59:44,624 --> 00:59:47,037
Samo zbunjeni.

1150
00:59:47,061 --> 00:59:49,344
Mislim da je u zabludi je mnogo bolje.

1151
00:59:49,368 --> 00:59:51,520
On je bezopasan.

1152
00:59:51,544 --> 00:59:55,219
Bezopasan je kao mače u prodavnici
za kućne ljubimce ili tako nešto.

1153
00:59:55,243 --> 00:59:57,811
Nije malo ljubavi-poludeo nutjob.

1154
01:00:02,033 --> 01:00:03,295
Znaš šta treba da uradite.

1155
01:00:04,949 --> 01:00:07,710
Grand gestovi, dušo.

1156
01:00:07,734 --> 01:00:09,190
Trudim se, mama.

1157
01:00:09,214 --> 01:00:11,627
Niko ne može da odoli bebu.

1158
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:14,480
Pokazali ste joj šta ljubav može biti.

1159
01:00:16,395 --> 01:00:17,701
Hoću, Mama.

1160
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:22,270
Hoću.

1161
01:00:24,098 --> 01:00:25,273
Hoću.

1162
01:00:27,972 --> 01:00:30,428
I'm gonna call him. Don't. Really.

1163
01:00:30,452 --> 01:00:33,040
I just wanna put this behind me, okay?

1164
01:00:33,064 --> 01:00:34,650
Look, can you kiss me?

1165
01:00:34,674 --> 01:00:37,348
Or is your testosterone level too strong?

1166
01:00:37,372 --> 01:00:39,960
Fine, but you're gonna have
to meet me halfway here

1167
01:00:39,984 --> 01:00:43,311
because I'm not exactly
mobile, and Nurse Bossy McGee

1168
01:00:43,335 --> 01:00:44,660
over there told me I gotta take it easy.

1169
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:46,077
Fine, fine.

1170
01:00:47,556 --> 01:00:50,231
Mama, mama, I'm just...

1171
01:00:50,255 --> 01:00:51,536
feeling down.

1172
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,756
Should I sing to you, baby?

1173
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,390
Sure, mama.

1174
01:00:57,262 --> 01:01:00,894
Âª Baby won't you please come home? Âª

1175
01:01:00,918 --> 01:01:03,723
âª 'Cause your mama's all alone âª

1176
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:06,856
âª When you left you broke my heart âª

1177
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,338
âª 'Cause you said we'll never part âª

1178
01:01:10,362 --> 01:01:13,297
âª Baby won't you please come home? Âª.

1179
01:01:13,321 --> 01:01:15,560
You always make me feel better.

1180
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:16,584
Thank you, mommy.

1181
01:01:18,762 --> 01:01:20,522
Did somebody just call my name?

1182
01:01:20,546 --> 01:01:23,438
Oh, you're a tyrant. Heh. Here you go.

1183
01:01:23,462 --> 01:01:26,223
Hej, maybe you should have
a talk with Nerdy McPsycho.

1184
01:01:26,247 --> 01:01:29,009
Oh, my God,
can we just stop talking about him.

1185
01:01:29,033 --> 01:01:30,924
And can you McStop it with the names?

1186
01:01:30,948 --> 01:01:32,012
"But I changed my look for you.

1187
01:01:32,036 --> 01:01:33,100
I told my mother about you."

1188
01:01:33,124 --> 01:01:34,362
You're my soulmate.

1189
01:01:34,386 --> 01:01:37,017
Buffering, buffering, buffering.

1190
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:39,367
Stop, he's just confused. Confused.

1191
01:01:39,391 --> 01:01:40,934
Yeah, well...

1192
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:43,153
I am not confused.

1193
01:01:43,177 --> 01:01:45,266
Come here, woman. Kiss me.

1194
01:01:47,573 --> 01:01:50,987
McHottie. Hmm, you know it.

1195
01:01:51,011 --> 01:01:53,642
You ready? Mm-hmm.

1196
01:01:53,666 --> 01:01:55,905
Ready for what?

1197
01:01:55,929 --> 01:01:57,080
You'll see.

1198
01:01:57,104 --> 01:01:58,192
Ah.

1199
01:02:04,068 --> 01:02:05,567
What's happening?

1200
01:02:07,332 --> 01:02:08,570
I would get down on one knee

1201
01:02:08,594 --> 01:02:09,963
but it'd be really awkward

1202
01:02:09,987 --> 01:02:11,399
if you had to pick me up.

1203
01:02:11,423 --> 01:02:13,662
Plus, this gets me the sympathy vote.

1204
01:02:13,686 --> 01:02:17,231
This isn't happening. Oh, it's happening.

1205
01:02:17,255 --> 01:02:19,668
Megan Libby, I know that
we've only known each other

1206
01:02:19,692 --> 01:02:20,800
for a few months, but...

1207
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:21,912
Yes.

1208
01:02:24,088 --> 01:02:25,543
I'm not finished yet. Yes.

1209
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:27,415
Yes, I will marry you.

1210
01:02:27,439 --> 01:02:30,026
All day, every day, forever and ever

1211
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,965
you silly gimp. Ha-ha!

1212
01:02:34,054 --> 01:02:37,033
I love you,
and I wanna spend forever with you

1213
01:02:37,057 --> 01:02:38,818
so you take as much time as you need.

1214
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:41,951
I rehearsed this speech
since the second week

1215
01:02:41,975 --> 01:02:43,736
we were together, so I had to get it done.

1216
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,781
What was wrong with the first week?

1217
01:02:45,805 --> 01:02:46,893
Oh, shut up.

1218
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,895
Dođi.

1219
01:02:53,465 --> 01:02:55,380
Volim te. Volim te.

1220
01:03:59,618 --> 01:04:01,074
Da li si čuo?

1221
01:04:01,098 --> 01:04:02,466
Ah, ja sam radila ugovora

1222
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:03,903
jer sam jutros

1223
01:04:03,927 --> 01:04:05,818
a nisam ni popio kafu, tako, ne.

1224
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,472
Čujete šta? Megan...

1225
01:04:08,496 --> 01:04:10,847
Šta ti je? Pete je mrtav.

1226
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:21,137
Oni su pronašli njegovo telo u reku.

1227
01:04:21,161 --> 01:04:24,010
Ko baca tela u reci?

1228
01:04:24,034 --> 01:04:27,970
Mislim, bio je definitivno ljigav

1229
01:04:27,994 --> 01:04:32,279
i on je bio potpuni
kreten, ali nije zaslužio.

1230
01:04:33,521 --> 01:04:36,805
Da li policija zna?

1231
01:04:36,829 --> 01:04:38,483
Samo da je bio mrtav za nedelju dana.

1232
01:04:39,701 --> 01:04:41,679
O Bože.

1233
01:04:41,703 --> 01:04:44,358
Mislim Ja...Ja verovatno jedan
od poslednjih ljudi da ga vide.

1234
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:48,338
On nikada nije otišao u Sijetlu.

1235
01:04:48,362 --> 01:04:52,647
Da li da osumnjičeni ima? Oh.
Da li se šališ na moj račun?

1236
01:04:52,671 --> 01:04:55,345
Ok, verovatno gledati previše "CSI".

1237
01:04:55,369 --> 01:04:57,043
Dobro.

1238
01:04:57,067 --> 01:04:58,958
Ali oni uvek ne razgovara poslednju osobu

1239
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:00,655
da vide pokojnika.

1240
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:03,919
I čudno, bezopasno strani lik.

1241
01:05:03,943 --> 01:05:05,573
O, moj Bože, ja mogu biti oboje.

1242
01:05:05,597 --> 01:05:07,227
III verovatno sam oboje.

1243
01:05:07,251 --> 01:05:10,186
But you have an alibi. Right and no motive.

1244
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:11,971
Well, actually... What?

1245
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:14,582
With Pete gone,
what does that mean for work?

1246
01:05:14,606 --> 01:05:16,714
I-I don't know,
he didn't really have much to do

1247
01:05:16,738 --> 01:05:19,543
with the deal, so, I...
I guess it relies on me now.

1248
01:05:19,567 --> 01:05:21,328
Oh! Okay, okay, this is way too dark.

1249
01:05:21,352 --> 01:05:22,807
Let's talk about something else.

1250
01:05:22,831 --> 01:05:26,202
Like the gorgeous earrings you got me.

1251
01:05:26,226 --> 01:05:29,162
Oh, my God. Kate...

1252
01:05:29,186 --> 01:05:33,122
Well... What?

1253
01:05:33,146 --> 01:05:34,384
How do you know what I'm getting for you?

1254
01:05:34,408 --> 01:05:36,996
I stalk your Amazon. You serious?

1255
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,432
I'm just being honest,
and while we're at it

1256
01:05:38,456 --> 01:05:39,868
sometimes I check where
you are when you're late.

1257
01:05:39,892 --> 01:05:42,001
It's a sister thing. I worry about you.

1258
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:44,394
You should be grateful. Oh...

1259
01:05:44,418 --> 01:05:46,266
Okay.

1260
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:48,616
How do you, how do you check where I
am, you stalker?

1261
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:53,142
Uh, Find My Phone.
We're both registered here on the desktop.

1262
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:54,927
And I know your password.

1263
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,668
Okay, that is a complete
invasion of privacy.

1264
01:05:57,692 --> 01:05:59,235
You know what, you, you and I

1265
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:00,497
we're gonna have a little conversation

1266
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:02,238
about boundaries very soon

1267
01:06:02,262 --> 01:06:05,372
but I can only handle one
insane thing at a time.

1268
01:06:05,396 --> 01:06:08,375
So, I'm just gonna forget that
you've been cyber-stalking me

1269
01:06:08,399 --> 01:06:09,942
and go back to my boss.

1270
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,639
Past.

1271
01:06:11,663 --> 01:06:13,162
Past boss.

1272
01:06:13,186 --> 01:06:16,949
Oh, my God. Poor Pete.

1273
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,104
Poor Pete.

1274
01:06:24,371 --> 01:06:26,480
Mama, so I've been thinking
about what you said

1275
01:06:26,504 --> 01:06:28,961
and I have the perfect grand gesture plan.

1276
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,551
Hold on, hold on.

1277
01:06:34,338 --> 01:06:35,382
Speak of the angel.

1278
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,145
Mama, I'll call you back. Okay?

1279
01:06:39,169 --> 01:06:40,605
Yeah, bye.

1280
01:07:03,367 --> 01:07:06,128
Okay, sure. Well, I'm...

1281
01:07:06,152 --> 01:07:08,000
I'm looking now, but I can't find anything

1282
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:11,220
they sent from April. You know what?

1283
01:07:11,244 --> 01:07:12,917
Why don't you double-check
and give me a call back

1284
01:07:12,941 --> 01:07:14,702
in a few minutes, okay?

1285
01:07:14,726 --> 01:07:16,554
Alright. Bye.

1286
01:07:27,347 --> 01:07:30,674
Âª Can't get close enough âª

1287
01:07:30,698 --> 01:07:34,330
v?? ª Za tebe ti si v?? ¬

1288
01:07:34,354 --> 01:07:36,724
v?? V?? Da ¬ ¬

1289
01:07:36,748 --> 01:07:39,446
v?? ª To je divna srcu?? ¬

1290
01:07:41,448 --> 01:07:43,600
v?? V?? Da ¬ ¬

1291
01:07:43,624 --> 01:07:46,758
v?? ¬ Pogledajte svetlost u mraku a?? ¬.

1292
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,642
Zdravo, Lloid.

1293
01:08:03,035 --> 01:08:05,274
Jako mi je žao. Bio sam idiot.

1294
01:08:05,298 --> 01:08:09,409
Da, da, si, ali to je bilo impresivno.

1295
01:08:09,433 --> 01:08:12,542
Ja samo... Ja iskreno ne
znam šta me je spopalo. Ja...

1296
01:08:12,566 --> 01:08:13,891
Mislim da je na svadbi odrastao osećanja

1297
01:08:13,915 --> 01:08:15,110
o smrti mog oca.

1298
01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:17,373
Poludeo sam.

1299
01:08:17,397 --> 01:08:21,247
Samo sam...
Osećao sam se potpuno Blindsided.

1300
01:08:21,271 --> 01:08:22,750
Znam, žao mi je.

1301
01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:26,513
Ono što sam najviše uznemirena
je naše prijateljstvo.

1302
01:08:26,537 --> 01:08:29,690
Ja sam stvarno nedostaje druženje s tobom.

1303
01:08:29,714 --> 01:08:31,866
I ja isto. Dozvoli mi da ti to nadoknadim.

1304
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:34,521
Uh, moja majka samo mi je
poslao najneverovatnije šnicle

1305
01:08:34,545 --> 01:08:36,914
od kuće. Dozvolite mi da vam večeru.

1306
01:08:36,938 --> 01:08:38,525
Vidi, ja ne mislim...

1307
01:08:38,549 --> 01:08:40,309
You know,
if-if it makes you more comfortable

1308
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:42,006
I'm seeing someone.

1309
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:44,835
A girl from work. Really?

1310
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:47,993
Yeah, she's amazing.
I think you'd really like her.

1311
01:08:50,082 --> 01:08:53,409
That's, that's great, Lloyd. Really.

1312
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:55,933
Megan, I just really
wanna apologize properly.

1313
01:08:55,957 --> 01:08:57,892
You're only my real friend in the city

1314
01:08:57,916 --> 01:09:01,200
and I'd love to share
my happiness with you.

1315
01:09:01,224 --> 01:09:03,419
And spend the rest of my
days making it up to you

1316
01:09:03,443 --> 01:09:05,421
for a random psychotic break.

1317
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,599
Oh, Lloyd.

1318
01:09:09,623 --> 01:09:11,253
And, of course, invite Chris too.

1319
01:09:11,277 --> 01:09:15,170
Uh, I'll invite my girl, it'll be...

1320
01:09:15,194 --> 01:09:17,564
God, Megan, I just,
I really wanna earn back

1321
01:09:17,588 --> 01:09:21,002
your trust and friendship.

1322
01:09:21,026 --> 01:09:24,484
Well, Chris is busy tonight,
but I do love a good steak.

1323
01:09:24,508 --> 01:09:26,442
Koliko god želite.

1324
01:09:26,466 --> 01:09:28,966
Ja, sa druge strane,
biće jesti ništa osim vrane.

1325
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:32,056
Dobro, dobro, u tom slučaju, ti si na redu.

1326
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,450
Veliki. Uh, 7:00? Dobro zvuči.

1327
01:09:34,474 --> 01:09:36,887
Pošalji mi adresu. Vidimo se onda.

1328
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:38,130
Vidimo se večeras.

1329
01:09:45,398 --> 01:09:47,052
Uđite. Otvoreno je.

1330
01:09:50,447 --> 01:09:51,709
Hej, Kris.

1331
01:09:54,102 --> 01:09:56,255
Lojd.

1332
01:09:56,279 --> 01:09:58,387
Vov. Uh, ja, ja nisam...

1333
01:09:58,411 --> 01:09:59,910
Nisam očekivao da te vidim.

1334
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:03,827
Hm, kako-kako si? Da li si dobro?

1335
01:10:03,851 --> 01:10:06,308
Da, dobro sam. Samo sam, uh...

1336
01:10:06,332 --> 01:10:08,595
Trebalo mi je da razgovaram sa tobom.
Jesi li zauzet?

1337
01:10:10,771 --> 01:10:12,923
Uh...

1338
01:10:12,947 --> 01:10:15,317
Pa, dobra stvar o tome
da na invalidsku odsustva

1339
01:10:15,341 --> 01:10:17,474
kada radite od kuće,
niko ne zna da si pauzu.

1340
01:10:19,171 --> 01:10:20,453
Kao u.

1341
01:10:20,477 --> 01:10:22,106
I'd get up, but I'm, uh...

1342
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:24,631
not exactly 100 percent here.

1343
01:10:24,655 --> 01:10:25,980
Do you want a beer?

1344
01:10:26,004 --> 01:10:27,484
No, I'm good. Thanks.

1345
01:10:30,748 --> 01:10:32,706
I feel so stupid.

1346
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:39,254
I get it.

1347
01:10:39,278 --> 01:10:42,692
Megan can have that effect on people.

1348
01:10:42,716 --> 01:10:45,304
No, you don't seem to get it.

1349
01:10:45,328 --> 01:10:46,459
I love her.

1350
01:10:48,461 --> 01:10:51,397
Oh...

1351
01:10:51,421 --> 01:10:54,487
Listen, Lloyd... No, no, no. No, Chris.

1352
01:10:54,511 --> 01:10:56,097
You listen.

1353
01:10:56,121 --> 01:10:58,360
She loves me too. Lloyd...

1354
01:10:58,384 --> 01:11:00,865
Yeah. Megan and I have a connection, Chris.

1355
01:11:02,475 --> 01:11:04,932
Okay? We have since the day we met.

1356
01:11:04,956 --> 01:11:08,979
I said I felt stupid because it
took me so long to act on it.

1357
01:11:09,003 --> 01:11:13,070
What we have is special, unique.

1358
01:11:13,094 --> 01:11:14,922
Her time with you is simply a diversion.

1359
01:11:17,098 --> 01:11:19,710
What we have is so powerful, it scares her.

1360
01:11:21,799 --> 01:11:22,930
Lloyd...

1361
01:11:24,584 --> 01:11:25,846
I think you should go.

1362
01:11:28,893 --> 01:11:30,198
Cool bat.

1363
01:11:31,504 --> 01:11:32,505
You play?

1364
01:11:34,028 --> 01:11:35,247
Take a swing.

1365
01:11:39,077 --> 01:11:41,098
Ah...

1366
01:11:41,122 --> 01:11:43,710
I know this must be hard to digest.

1367
01:11:43,734 --> 01:11:46,432
It's heartbreaking realizing
that you've been a pawn.

1368
01:11:48,956 --> 01:11:52,458
But it's time for you to go, not me.

1369
01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:54,373
She simply needs the obstacles removed

1370
01:11:54,397 --> 01:11:56,723
before she can accept her faith.

1371
01:11:56,747 --> 01:11:59,160
Which is she and I, together.

1372
01:11:59,184 --> 01:12:01,969
She knows this in her heart,
but you keep muddying things.

1373
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,514
Lloyd...

1374
01:12:05,538 --> 01:12:06,994
Sometimes...

1375
01:12:07,018 --> 01:12:08,169
something so true

1376
01:12:08,193 --> 01:12:10,867
and powerful can be scary.

1377
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:14,958
What we have is just that. It's undeniable.

1378
01:12:14,982 --> 01:12:18,353
I am simply clearing a path
for her to see and accept that.

1379
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:19,509
And you, Chris...

1380
01:12:21,424 --> 01:12:23,967
you are in my path.

1381
01:12:23,991 --> 01:12:25,317
Lloyd... Aah!

1382
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,057
She doesn't love you!

1383
01:12:27,081 --> 01:12:28,885
She doesn't love you!

1384
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:30,084
She doesn't love you!

1385
01:13:32,364 --> 01:13:33,776
I honestly feel like
this is a turning point

1386
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,169
in our relationship, mama.

1387
01:13:35,193 --> 01:13:37,476
I haven't felt this good in days.

1388
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,043
Yeah, I think she's happy
that I'm back in her life.

1389
01:13:40,067 --> 01:13:42,809
Absence makes the heart grow fonder, baby.

1390
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:51,557
It's open. Come on in.

1391
01:13:57,998 --> 01:14:00,020
Hello.

1392
01:14:00,044 --> 01:14:01,413
I'm in the kitchen. Come on back.

1393
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,003
Okay.

1394
01:14:08,052 --> 01:14:10,944
Wow, this place is stunning. Stunning.

1395
01:14:10,968 --> 01:14:12,448
Jinx! You owe me a coke.

1396
01:14:14,275 --> 01:14:16,210
Too soon.

1397
01:14:16,234 --> 01:14:17,907
Da.

1398
01:14:17,931 --> 01:14:19,150
Hej.

1399
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:25,654
Nedostajao si mi. I ti si meni, takođe.

1400
01:14:25,678 --> 01:14:27,700
Žao mi je, ja sam bio takav psihopata.

1401
01:14:27,724 --> 01:14:29,702
Hajde da to krive na venčanju.

1402
01:14:29,726 --> 01:14:33,227
Venčanja imaju tendenciju da se čak
i sanest nas izgubiti naše umove.

1403
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:36,578
Mislim, muzika sama...
Ipak, osećam se užasno.

1404
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:39,320
Ponižen i strašno. Dobro je.

1405
01:14:39,344 --> 01:14:41,409
Stvarno, hajde da otarasiti čudni fazi

1406
01:14:41,433 --> 01:14:43,498
i idu u prihvatanju

1407
01:14:43,522 --> 01:14:44,934
i oproštaj faza.

1408
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:46,545
Molimo vas. Dobro.

1409
01:14:46,569 --> 01:14:47,787
Dobro, hajde.

1410
01:14:49,746 --> 01:14:51,550
Gde je tvoja devojka?

1411
01:14:51,574 --> 01:14:53,856
Ja sam, ovaj,
nadajući se da će je upoznati.

1412
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:57,381
O, vau. Hm...

1413
01:14:57,405 --> 01:14:58,687
Pa, rekao si Kris nije mogao da dođe

1414
01:14:58,711 --> 01:15:01,473
so I told her another time.

1415
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:05,172
Wow, this is weird. I'm so sorry.

1416
01:15:05,196 --> 01:15:07,566
Let me call her,
I'm sure she can be here in 20 minutes.

1417
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:10,786
Oh, don't be silly, Lloyd. Really?

1418
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:12,701
The last thing I wanna do is
make you feel uncomfortable.

1419
01:15:12,725 --> 01:15:15,008
It's fine. Really.

1420
01:15:15,032 --> 01:15:16,816
It also smells fantastic.

1421
01:15:18,122 --> 01:15:20,317
Thank you.

1422
01:15:20,341 --> 01:15:23,059
Can I open up the wine? Yes, please.

1423
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:24,998
Fancy. I know.

1424
01:15:28,785 --> 01:15:30,458
So I guess when I said I had a Victorian

1425
01:15:30,482 --> 01:15:32,765
that was only partially true.

1426
01:15:32,789 --> 01:15:35,115
As in, I don't have, I rent.

1427
01:15:35,139 --> 01:15:36,749
It's really lovely.

1428
01:15:38,142 --> 01:15:39,360
Slanted roof and all.

1429
01:15:40,623 --> 01:15:41,991
Thank you.

1430
01:15:42,015 --> 01:15:44,820
So, do I get the official tour?

1431
01:15:44,844 --> 01:15:46,779
Of course.

1432
01:15:46,803 --> 01:15:48,955
This is the kitchen.

1433
01:15:48,979 --> 01:15:51,392
Wow, you're an excellent tour guide.
Heh-heh.

1434
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:54,613
Well, my Yelp reviews are exceptional.

1435
01:15:54,637 --> 01:15:56,963
Follow me. The tour continues this way.

1436
01:15:56,987 --> 01:15:58,249
Okay.

1437
01:16:13,481 --> 01:16:15,503
Yes.

1438
01:16:15,527 --> 01:16:17,897
Most of the furniture belongs to my mother.

1439
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:20,421
She shifted here for me.
Oh, that's sweet of her.

1440
01:16:20,445 --> 01:16:22,641
I'd be lost without her.

1441
01:16:22,665 --> 01:16:24,425
She plans to move out
here once I'm settled.

1442
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:29,038
I bet the steaks are almost ready.

1443
01:16:29,062 --> 01:16:32,389
Can I fill up your wine? Yes, please.

1444
01:16:32,413 --> 01:16:35,392
Oh, hej, does the tour include
directions to the bathroom

1445
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:37,438
because, TCH, wine.

1446
01:16:37,462 --> 01:16:38,874
Right down the hall, to your right.

1447
01:16:38,898 --> 01:16:40,702
Okay. I'll be back.

1448
01:16:40,726 --> 01:16:41,814
I'll be here.

1449
01:16:44,164 --> 01:16:46,621
Hej, Chris, it's me, um...

1450
01:16:46,645 --> 01:16:48,492
I, I can't get a hold of Megan

1451
01:16:48,516 --> 01:16:51,583
and she said she was having dinner
with, uh, Lloyd.

1452
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,323
Is she crazy?

1453
01:16:53,347 --> 01:16:55,369
I know I'm just being a paranoid sister

1454
01:16:55,393 --> 01:16:57,371
and you can just tell me that, but...

1455
01:16:57,395 --> 01:16:59,068
Will you just call me back? Okay?

1456
01:16:59,092 --> 01:17:00,113
I don't wanna bother you, I just keep

1457
01:17:00,137 --> 01:17:02,071
uzimajući svoju govornu poštu, tako da...

1458
01:17:02,095 --> 01:17:03,899
Pozovi me kada budeš mogao.

1459
01:17:03,923 --> 01:17:05,248
Zdravo.

1460
01:17:05,272 --> 01:17:06,796
Hvala vam. Dobro.

1461
01:17:44,398 --> 01:17:46,812
Megan. Aah!

1462
01:17:46,836 --> 01:17:48,838
Nisam bio spreman da pokaže to ti, Megan.

1463
01:17:52,363 --> 01:17:53,756
Ovo?

1464
01:17:55,453 --> 01:17:56,802
Šta je ovo?

1465
01:17:57,934 --> 01:18:00,913
To je omaž vama.

1466
01:18:00,937 --> 01:18:04,394
Naporno sam radio na tome.
Nadam se da to ceniti.

1467
01:18:04,418 --> 01:18:06,638
Iako, sad si upropastio iznenađenje.

1468
01:18:08,509 --> 01:18:10,749
Sećaš li se kada sam ti
rekao da sam te želeo

1469
01:18:10,773 --> 01:18:11,817
da zadovolji moju devojku?

1470
01:18:15,299 --> 01:18:17,538
Vidiš? To nije bio fibrilacija.

1471
01:18:17,562 --> 01:18:19,583
Mm...

1472
01:18:19,607 --> 01:18:21,044
Zdravo, devojka.

1473
01:18:34,405 --> 01:18:36,775
Niste mi odgovorili, Megan.

1474
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,428
Ah, šta-šta-šta?

1475
01:18:41,673 --> 01:18:42,848
Da li ti se sviđa?

1476
01:18:45,372 --> 01:18:47,418
Lloyd, why are you doing this?

1477
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,573
I got this for you.

1478
01:18:52,597 --> 01:18:55,097
For us.

1479
01:18:55,121 --> 01:18:57,733
You said you wanted a Victorian.
I got you a Victorian.

1480
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:02,365
Jack didn't. Chris didn't.

1481
01:19:02,389 --> 01:19:04,106
I did.

1482
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:05,542
Mama said grand gestures.

1483
01:19:05,566 --> 01:19:07,046
This is a grand gesture.

1484
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:10,243
The steaks are ready.

1485
01:19:10,267 --> 01:19:12,008
I hope you are hungry.

1486
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:16,684
Please, do me a favor.

1487
01:19:16,708 --> 01:19:18,817
Stop ruining my surprises, they've been

1488
01:19:18,841 --> 01:19:20,862
carefully and meticulously planned.

1489
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:23,125
Okay, seriously, Megan.

1490
01:19:23,149 --> 01:19:25,258
Pick up the damn phone. Where are you?

1491
01:19:25,282 --> 01:19:26,738
I can't get a hold of you or Chris, and now

1492
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,720
I'm officially that sister.

1493
01:19:40,688 --> 01:19:41,883
Hello, Megan...

1494
01:19:41,907 --> 01:19:43,363
Let the wine breath for a moment

1495
01:19:43,387 --> 01:19:44,605
before I pour it.

1496
01:19:50,263 --> 01:19:52,720
This reminds me of our first date.

1497
01:19:52,744 --> 01:19:54,896
It was perfect.

1498
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,202
Remember when you didn't
wanna buy our picture?

1499
01:19:56,226 --> 01:19:58,508
Aren't you glad we did?

1500
01:19:58,532 --> 01:19:59,901
Where's yours?

1501
01:19:59,925 --> 01:20:01,947
Um...

1502
01:20:01,971 --> 01:20:03,644
Oh, where is my what, Lloyd?

1503
01:20:03,668 --> 01:20:05,801
Our first picture.
We can put them together.

1504
01:20:07,498 --> 01:20:09,650
Oh, um...

1505
01:20:09,674 --> 01:20:11,565
I-it's in my house.

1506
01:20:11,589 --> 01:20:14,176
Right next to the photo of, uh, Kate and I

1507
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,723
when we were kids.

1508
01:20:17,769 --> 01:20:20,356
Um, hej, I-I told you...

1509
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:23,577
I told you about my
grandmother's Victorian, right?

1510
01:20:23,601 --> 01:20:26,841
It looks just like this one.

1511
01:20:26,865 --> 01:20:30,453
Yes. See? I... I hear you.

1512
01:20:30,477 --> 01:20:34,264
Megan, I listen to you,
that's what makes us soulmates.

1513
01:20:39,095 --> 01:20:40,400
No phones at the dinner table.

1514
01:20:42,098 --> 01:20:43,229
No, no, no.

1515
01:20:47,364 --> 01:20:49,646
No phones at the dinner table!

1516
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:51,431
I'm not gonna say it again, Megan.

1517
01:20:51,455 --> 01:20:53,520
Hello, Me...

1518
01:20:53,544 --> 01:20:54,588
Damn it!

1519
01:20:57,461 --> 01:20:58,766
Thank you, sweetie.

1520
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,902
We can tell everyone our good news later.

1521
01:21:05,425 --> 01:21:06,425
Ah...

1522
01:21:13,607 --> 01:21:15,653
Sada, jedi svoju šniclu
pre nego što se ohladi.

1523
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:19,657
Evo, ja ću smanjiti za tebe.

1524
01:21:26,577 --> 01:21:28,884
Protein je najvažniji deo svakog obroka.

1525
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:33,714
Lojd? Da draga.

1526
01:21:35,281 --> 01:21:36,911
Odakle ti te slike?

1527
01:21:36,935 --> 01:21:38,957
Hmm, uzeo sam ih.

1528
01:21:38,981 --> 01:21:41,176
Morao sam da proverim na mom konkurencije.

1529
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,028
Ti-ti... Da.

1530
01:21:46,336 --> 01:21:48,618
Džek je morao da ode, dušo,
nije bio u pravu za tebe.

1531
01:21:48,642 --> 01:21:49,992
Joga učitelj, stvarno?

1532
01:21:51,297 --> 01:21:53,125
Bar, Kris je bio advokat.

1533
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,323
Šta... Šta je?

1534
01:21:57,347 --> 01:22:00,326
I Pete, nije vas ceniti.

1535
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:02,894
Ja nikada neće uzeti zdravo za gotovo.

1536
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:05,287
Ikada.

1537
01:22:07,705 --> 01:22:09,465
Ukusna, zar ne?

1538
01:22:09,489 --> 01:22:10,490
Mmm...

1539
01:22:14,538 --> 01:22:16,690
Hajde.

1540
01:22:16,714 --> 01:22:18,344
Policija je na svom putu.

1541
01:22:18,368 --> 01:22:20,607
Šta je Dr. Lessner lozinka? Hm, hm...

1542
01:22:20,631 --> 01:22:23,958
"Osećati se dobro." Kao u doktora.
Ok dobro. Shvatio sam.

1543
01:22:27,029 --> 01:22:29,529
To je morao da bude obrok za pamćenje.

1544
01:22:29,553 --> 01:22:31,903
Naš prvi... u našoj novoj kući.

1545
01:22:34,471 --> 01:22:37,711
To je veoma lepo od tebe.

1546
01:22:37,735 --> 01:22:41,149
Oh, ne mogu da dočekam da upoznaš mamu.

1547
01:22:41,173 --> 01:22:43,673
Tako mi je drago što smo
mogli otarasiti svih prepreka

1548
01:22:43,697 --> 01:22:45,937
da je rekla bilo na putu.

1549
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,155
Moj otac je bio prva prepreka

1550
01:22:47,179 --> 01:22:48,920
zato sam ga ukloniti.

1551
01:22:51,314 --> 01:22:53,596
Znate, naučio sam rano da
možete imati bilo koju stvar

1552
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:56,275
ti srce želi da samo ukloniti prepreke.

1553
01:22:58,016 --> 01:22:59,148
U pravu si.

1554
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:01,953
Ja...

1555
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,152
Zaslužio sam više.

1556
01:23:04,762 --> 01:23:06,068
Stvarno.

1557
01:23:08,722 --> 01:23:11,136
Tako sam srećna.

1558
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,659
Kejt, znaš da se to uradi
na svom telefonu, zar ne?

1559
01:23:12,683 --> 01:23:14,883
Nemam aplikaciju.
Potrebno je mnogo vremena da preuzme.

1560
01:23:16,948 --> 01:23:18,491
Prednosti imaju istu lozinku.

1561
01:23:18,515 --> 01:23:20,101
Hajde. Shvatio sam.

1562
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:21,450
Oh, hvala, divna Cloud

1563
01:23:21,474 --> 01:23:23,191
i potpuna invazija na privatnost.

1564
01:23:23,215 --> 01:23:25,280
Ok, ovo je adresa. Uh huh. U redu.

1565
01:23:25,304 --> 01:23:27,500
To je situacija sa taocima. To je Megan.

1566
01:23:27,524 --> 01:23:29,067
U redu. To je njen telefon.

1567
01:23:29,091 --> 01:23:30,068
Reci im da ću ih se tamo.

1568
01:23:30,092 --> 01:23:31,180
Će učiniti. Dobro.

1569
01:23:34,052 --> 01:23:35,943
To je samo ti i ja sada.

1570
01:23:35,967 --> 01:23:37,186
Zauvek.

1571
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,515
Megan? Šta si ti... šta?

1572
01:23:42,539 --> 01:23:45,300
Megan? Šta radiš? Zaustaviti! Zaustaviti!

1573
01:23:45,324 --> 01:23:47,433
Da li... Ne radi to.

1574
01:23:47,457 --> 01:23:49,609
Ne! Da li ti to pokušavaš da... Ne!

1575
01:23:49,633 --> 01:23:51,176
Šta radiš? Prestani.

1576
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,331
Mama proveli...

1577
01:23:56,509 --> 01:23:57,597
Megan!

1578
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:03,927
Šta je to odvesti da li da ostane?

1579
01:24:03,951 --> 01:24:06,626
Ti ne želiš da uradim nešto
drastično, zar ne?

1580
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:08,236
Da li, Megan?
Da li moram da uradim nešto drastično?

1581
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:10,978
Ne! Ne, ne. Ne.

1582
01:24:14,745 --> 01:24:16,825
Mislim da sam izgubila malo
poverenja za tebe, Megan.

1583
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:21,380
Poverenje... je najvažniji deo

1584
01:24:21,404 --> 01:24:22,492
iz veze.

1585
01:24:24,233 --> 01:24:26,211
Mogu li da ti verujem, Megan? Da.

1586
01:24:26,235 --> 01:24:29,388
Mogu li da ti verujem? Da. Da.

1587
01:24:29,412 --> 01:24:30,717
Možete.

1588
01:24:32,284 --> 01:24:33,416
Volim te.

1589
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,120
Megan!

1590
01:24:45,341 --> 01:24:47,319
U redu je. U redu je, bezbedna si.

1591
01:24:47,343 --> 01:24:49,582
U redu je, u redu si. Ste bezbedni.

1592
01:24:49,606 --> 01:24:52,628
On je ubijen Kris.

1593
01:24:52,652 --> 01:24:54,500
Ne! Ne ne ne. Ubio Chris.

1594
01:24:54,524 --> 01:24:56,110
Megs, vidi.

1595
01:24:58,571 --> 01:25:00,182
Dođi. Dođi.

1596
01:25:01,748 --> 01:25:03,248
Ti si ok. Ti si ok.

1597
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:06,101
U redu je. U redu je.

1598
01:25:09,278 --> 01:25:11,323
Ti si ok. Ti si ok.

1599
01:25:14,631 --> 01:25:16,130
Megan!

1600
01:25:16,154 --> 01:25:17,286
Megan!

1601
01:25:22,465 --> 01:25:25,618
Niko nikada neće te kako te volim.

1602
01:25:25,642 --> 01:25:28,229
Mama je rekla "grand gestovi."

1603
01:25:28,253 --> 01:25:29,298
Mama said...

1604
01:25:31,213 --> 01:25:32,755
G. Murrov je, baci taj nož. Mama said...

1605
01:25:32,779 --> 01:25:34,279
Baci nož. Mama je rekla, mama je rekla...

1606
01:25:34,303 --> 01:25:36,846
Pusti to! Dobro, hajde, mali. Mama said...

1607
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:39,022
Ruke iza leđa.

1608
01:25:39,046 --> 01:25:41,329
Ruke gde možemo da ih vidim.
Stavi ruke iza leđa.

1609
01:25:41,353 --> 01:25:43,201
Mama je rekla, mama je rekla...

1610
01:25:43,225 --> 01:25:45,507
Mama je rekla, mama je rekla...

1611
01:25:45,531 --> 01:25:47,857
Mama je rekla, mama je rekla...

1612
01:25:47,881 --> 01:25:49,337
Mama said...

1613
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:35,253
Ti si ok? Tako mi je žao.

1614
01:26:35,277 --> 01:26:37,951
Šta mislite? Nemoj se izvinjavati.

1615
01:26:37,975 --> 01:26:39,281
Nisi uradio ništa loše.

1616
01:26:42,806 --> 01:26:44,610
Zar ti nije drago da si dobro?

1617
01:26:44,634 --> 01:26:46,307
Mislim, znaš da nisi...

1618
01:26:46,331 --> 01:26:49,615
Mislim, znaš da nisi veliki, ali...

1619
01:26:49,639 --> 01:26:51,094
Ti si ok.

1620
01:26:51,118 --> 01:26:52,250
Da.

1621
01:26:54,687 --> 01:26:55,819
Hej, uh...

1622
01:26:58,082 --> 01:27:00,626
Hajde da se venčamo, u redu?

1623
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:03,218
Ja-Ja ne u šoku. Ja sam potpuno jasan.

1624
01:27:05,872 --> 01:27:07,067
Da li ste sigurni?

1625
01:27:07,091 --> 01:27:08,764
Nikada nisam bio sigurniji

1626
01:27:08,788 --> 01:27:10,268
o bilo čemu ikada.

1627
01:27:12,923 --> 01:27:15,293
Odustati od svega ovoga?

1628
01:27:15,317 --> 01:27:16,405
Ućuti.

1629
01:27:19,799 --> 01:27:20,799
Volim te.

1629
01:27:21,305 --> 01:28:21,900
