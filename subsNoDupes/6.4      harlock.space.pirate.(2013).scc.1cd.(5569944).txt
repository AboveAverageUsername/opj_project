00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,970
<i>U dalekoj buducnosti ili mozda bas dalekoj proslosti...</i>

4
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:42,060
<i>Ljudska rasa se rasirila sirom galaksije, stvarajuci kolonije na dalekim planetama.</i>

5
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,480
<i>Nihova populacija se sirila, njihov broj se prosirio na bilione.</i>

6
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:53,070
<i>Ali resorsi su se potrosili, bela kuga je zavladala, i vreme ljudi je mozda doslo kraju</i>

7
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,530
<i>Revolucija je pocela  za povratak kuci na zemlju.</i>

8
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:05,670
<i>Ali planeta ne moze podrzati povratak mnogih</i>

9
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:13,590
<i>Veliki rat za pravo povratka je poceo, poznat kao
"Povratnicka bitka"</i>

10
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:20,560
<i>I tako je nastala Parlamentarna struktura, "Gaia Koalicija", da privede rat kraju.</i>

11
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:28,270
<i>Gaia koalicija je nazvala zemlju "svetim mestom" gde nikom nije bilo dozvoljeno da udje.</i>

12
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,070
<i>Planeta je postala nesto zabranjeno, iako je stanovnistvo planete izumiralo.</i>

13
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:38,780
<i>Ali tu je bio, covek koji se odupirao...</i>

14
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,830
<i>i Nastavljao po celom svemiru.</i>

15
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:50,080
<i>Svemirski pitat, besmrtik poslednjeg soja, u nedostojnom brodu federacije.</i>

16
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,130
<i>Trazen Gaia koalicije, kod S-00999</i>

17
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,470
<i>Njegovo ime je-</i>

18
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,560
Mzim ovu omladinu...

19
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,570
osecam da jedva cekaju da umres.

20
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,490
To je sigurno.

21
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,570
Ovaj grad je njesra

22
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,530
A i planeta je gotova.

23
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,120
Nije planeta, nego mi ljudi.

24
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,900
Ako nista bar sam ja gotov...

25
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,480
Brod sa emigrantima...

26
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,430
OVA vibracija, nije sigurno...?

27
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,930
Borbeni!

28
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,490
Mi smo gotovi,

29
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,540
Ostavi to mladjim momcima?

30
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,170
To je Arkadia.

31
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,680
Brze! pozuri! da ne ode!

32
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,640
Univerzum je tako velik

33
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,610
A covecanstvo tako malo...

34
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,480
Ali sa malim trackom slave

35
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,530
I tako pocinje velicanstveni trenutak,

36
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,370
Sto nije tako prosto.

37
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,370
Solarni sistem...

38
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,100
ili ide u zaborav

39
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,600
ili uci u nas nedogled

40
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,510
Mi vec znamo...

41
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,140
Ljudi su ocajno sami.

42
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,440
Culi smo da trazite posadu! Zaposlite nas!

43
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,910
Treba nam samo jedan.

44
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Zasto si ovde?

45
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,690
 Zbog slave!

46
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,430
Pare!

47
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,780
Sloboda

48
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,190
Kako se zoves?

49
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,700
Yama

50
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,380
Samo nemoj da zaboravis tu rec

51
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,050
To je moto broda

52
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,140
Spremni za polazak!

53
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,740
Samo napred

54
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,400
Neka se KeJ postara za novajliju.

55
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,110
Zasto ja?

56
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,740
Ti si preuzela odgovornost.

57
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,490
Covecanstvo izumire

58
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,000
Pozuri i hodaj!

59
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,000
Cak ici i u napred je beznacajno

60
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,990
Nista se ne menja

61
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,840
nikako ...

62
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,080
Nestavi napred

63
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,920
nepriljatelski senzori su pronadjeni

64
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,820
MX201 je nasao rastuci izvor energije

65
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,180
Upozorenje!

66
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,000
Objekat se priblizava.

67
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,280
Prvelikom brzinom

68
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,840
120 sekundi pre udara

69
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,580
Detektovano prisustvo crne materije

70
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,420
To je cetvrti brod u Crnoj senci - Arkadia!

71
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,690
Kapetane Harlok

72
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,250
Preuzecu komandu.

73
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,920
Kapetan naredjuje. svi na polozaje

74
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,960
Svi odmah!

75
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,540
Hej! skoni mi se sa puta!

76
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,640
Ti patrolni brodovi se priblizavaju...

77
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,300
Izvinite me

78
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,590
Sta to radis?

79
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,460
Mi smo borci?

80
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,400
Pratite ih.  pravo napred.

81
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,260
Priprema!

82
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,820
DS klasa brod 1

83
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,470
Saljemo borce

84
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,080
Prvi komadant.  Krecemo u borbu, saljem borce

85
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,330
Svi piloti, pitati su naoruzani jonskim gasom

86
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,170
Pirati koriste tu vrstu oruzija?

87
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,300
Svi piloti, napadajte odozgo sa brzim spustovima

88
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,810
Bazirajte napad na brodsu sondu!

89
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,060
STa?

90
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,740
Nema ostecenja...

91
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,710
Ko kontrolise borce?

92
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,900
novajlija gospodine.

93
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,090
Ko bi rekao.

94
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,470
meta se povlaci, okrece 180 stepeni

95
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,520
Br. 6, Br. 8  motori na 12%

96
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:33,730
Kapetane!

97
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,580
Potvrdi!

98
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,520
to je Agent F111.

99
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,800
idi u Bajonet!

100
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,430
Pozuri na brodsku palubu!

101
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,560
Ajde, brze!

102
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:15,110
gravitacioni ankeri uredu, ciljalj po volji

103
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,640
Zurka

104
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,260
ne mrdaj.

105
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,820
to je Opticki Skener

106
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,000
Boli.

107
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,530
prestace posle 4-5 minuta.

108
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,700
Moras da se ubacis i spijuniras harloka i posadu

109
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,720
Spasoh te.

110
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,510
Ne setaj okolo bez okopnog odela.

111
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,510
napadaju most, pozuri Kej

112
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,430
Znam sta radim.

113
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,470
e, cekaj,

114
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,310

115
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,230
pronalazenje metinih dobara

116
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,990
auto pilot iskljucen

117
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,660
kao da smo na zetvi.

118
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,250
Paznaja, Kapetan govori!

119
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,590
Sada cemo otkaciti unijin brod.

120
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,710
Aktivirajte crnu materiju!

121
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,420
sacekajte dalje komande.

122
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,260
Razumem!

123
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,510
culi ste, startuj sistem crne materije!

124
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,950
Prijavljeno je da je  MX patrolni brod,

125
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,990
Imao kontakt Arkadijom.

126
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,950
Agent F111,

127
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,580
Moras nastaviti po planu.

128
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,950
Taj brod...

129
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,570
Ce uskoro biti nas.

130
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,630
taj kliminalac nas terorise godinama.

131
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:13,260
100 godina potojimo i on nas nece zaustaviti.

132
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,930
Mora biti zaustavljen.

133
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:22,340
Gaia flota ce sve uraditi da to zavrsi.

134
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,220
Mozes li to?

135
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:26,590
Da gospodine.

136
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,490
Ezra,

137
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:34,050
Glavni komadanti su zadovoljni tobom.

138
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,510
Cast mi je gospodine.

139
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,610
Cekacemo na dobre vesti.

140
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,820
Njegov mladji brat je agent?

141
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,210
Mora da se dokaze koaliciji

142
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,530
nije tako tesko sluziti gaia floti

143
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,810
sta moze da krene po zlu?

144
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,170
jednog dana put pod noge

145
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:27,460
sreca isto moze biti nagrada

146
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,070
Nami

147
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,240
Zasto, Ezra?

148
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,100
Zasto je dat zadatak Jami?

149
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,820
VErujem mu.

150
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:10,920
On je savrsen za ovo.

151
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,720
Sastanak uskoro pocinje

152
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,710
Razumem.

153
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,700
ne interesuje me vojska

154
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,830
zelim da budem kao moja majka, samo posmatrac

155
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,220
Nesrecom,

156
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,530
Arkadija nema sistem samopopravke

157
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,400
taj deo je otkazao skroz

158
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,280
Van nase granice

159
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,950
Energija crne materije je neiscrpna

160
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,960
Nabavljanje potrebstina je tezak posao

161
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,120
Ovaj brod je sve sto nam treba.

162
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,460
koja energija crne materije?

163
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,140
Ta...

164
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,930
pre sto godina za vreme rata

165
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,630
Vanzemaljska civilizacija zvana Srbende...

166
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,930
Usavrsila je tu cudesnu masinu

167
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,310
ne znam na koji sistem radi

168
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,190
Samo su srbende znale da upravljaju sa njom

169
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,650
Ona je zadnja od srba.

170
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,310
Jedina koja je imala kontakt sa ljudima

171
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,610
Komunikacija ce biti teska

172
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,750
Mogu li da vas pitam nesto, Yatarane?

173
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,350
Naravno.

174
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,490
Jel kapetan stvarno ima preko sto godina ?

175
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,510
I heroji stare...

176
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,270
I nastavljalju istrazivati univerzum

177
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,840
Mnogo ih je sa dosijeom

178
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,630
Ljudi kao ti.

179
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,560
Ja...

180
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,010
Razocaran sam.

181
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,090
vratiti se onome sto je ostalo od zemlje.

182
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,050
Coveciji zivot je sekunda

183
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,380
Kad se rodi u ovo doba

184
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,940
mozes naterati coveka da radi sta hoces

185
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,100
u redu sam?

186
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,230
vibracije ce biti prijavljene

187
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,620
nema nsta sto se ne moze iskoristiti jos

188
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,600
sve u redu, nema problema...

189
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,510
dobro sta je poenta...

190
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,300
Prijatelji

191
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,670
sin...

192
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,240
nas dug put...

193
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,070
Ti si ovde.

194
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,650
cas je nastupio...

195
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,560
na tebi je da odlucis.

196
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,760
zasto si ga pustila?

197
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,710
sad razumem.

198
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,370
kao sto ostali kazu

199
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:43,970
Sloboda

200
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,980
Vidim nesto u njemu.

201
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,880
Dobro onda,

202
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,390
ce vidimo...

203
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,810
"Gramm" Klasa planeta osme galaksije

204
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,060
Tuka Jia

205
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,690
Blok 99 je na planeti

206
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,610
sta je Blok 99?

207
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,530
dimenzionalna bojeva glava

208
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,960
Ljudi su napustili ovo mesto

209
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,750
 mnogo je opasna

210
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,550
 ko je dobrovoljac?

211
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,720
sta je? prpa?

212
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,760
Evo ja cu...

213
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,770
izvina ali...

214
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,270
on tek treba da se dokaze.

215
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,750
Budi na doku za 10 min

216
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,790
zasto si se prijavio?

217
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,940
bio mi je san da udjem na brod

218
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,470
svi to zele.

219
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,270
i to je to?

220
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,520
Hocu da se dokazem.

221
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,980
gde to idemo?

222
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,880
cekaj i videces.

223
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,730
Koristi kamufkazu.

224
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,670
Dimensional Oscillation Warhead...

225
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:22,310
So this thing can provide all the energy we need.

226
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,010
Pretty neat isn't it?

227
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:38,010
Set coordinates of latitude 32 degrees 7 minutes

228
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,180
Longitude 126 degrees 4 minutes

229
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,290
Jim Dahl High Lands, east of the Wye valley at the southern end. Mark, please

230
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,270
Coordinates confirmed

231
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,240
Descending now.

232
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,500
We're initiating the task now.

233
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,830
Watch out for corrosive gases.

234
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,670
These are corrosive gases for detonation.

235
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,180
We need to complete this in one hour.

236
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,860
Just follow me.

237
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,370
Kane is best for this environment.

238
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,060
They are very useful here

239
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:16,110
Some biologists studied their special abilities.

240
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:16,980
What are they?

241
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,130
They can survive the gases without side-effects.

242
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,430
That's amazing.

243
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,820
That's why we start over.

244
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:34,920
Start over?

245
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,510
Regardless of where we look in the universe.

246
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,930
Aside from Earth...

247
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,950
They don't let their fellow humans be identified as their own kind

248
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,240
Everyone wants to go home

249
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:51,750
However, due to the Gaia Coalition the Earth became "a sacred land"

250
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,680
No-one is permitted to enter.

251
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,500
Going back to Earth is not gonna be easy.

252
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,300
Everyone said that humanity will soon come to an end.

253
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,980
Humanity is scattered everywhere in the universe.

254
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,990
Like a resurgence of species.

255
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,440
At least the last time

256
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,460
Did not want to do in their own lives

257
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,410
Option One,

258
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,200
Go back to the distant past...

259
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,640
The early days of human life

260
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,630
But how?

261
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,370
The Junction Point will unlock the harness of time

262
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,620
Where is it?

263
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,630
Somewhere in this universe

264
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,130
there's a place where time gaps are connected

265
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,590
free from the shackles of causality,

266
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,140
The universe from a continuous cycle of time.

267
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,400
Freedom.

268
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:57,210
But it needs a large amount of energy,

269
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,540
We need to close the Gap in the universe...

270
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,320
The one that is untied

271
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,160
That is...

272
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:09,370
If we deployed it in the universe...

273
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,160
2 million vibration bombs would detonate simultaneously.

274
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,410
It would unlock the "time of the end point"

275
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,360
Well, I acted like a captain.

276
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,590
The purpose of these bombs,

277
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,270
I still don't understand it

278
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,300
What if what you just said proves wrong...

279
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,990
everyone might be in danger.

280
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,460
I trust the Captain's decision.

281
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,160
though I don't really agree with his goals.

282
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:46,030
But we need to trust him.

283
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,850
What's going on?

284
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,050
I've never felt this before

285
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,220
Hurry! Get back!

286
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,900
That's not a rock formation but a Strata Serpent!

287
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,720
Oh, crap

288
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,060
Are you okay?

289
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,340
I'm okay.

290
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,830
Let me go , I want to go back

291
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,730
Don't be a fool, do you want to die?

292
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,360
It was my fault it fell in

293
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,190
There are corrosive gases in there.

294
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,670
You will also get involved in it

295
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,790
What about him?

296
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,580
Sometimes you have all the bad luck.

297
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,130
No way!

298
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,130
Captain.

299
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:12,400
They're withered, also the trees.

300
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,180
These species are not ready for Yama

301
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,740
These flowers can only bloom on Earth.

302
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:20,320
Mars is not suitable for mother's dream.

303
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:20,960
Yama

304
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,620
Stop it!

305
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,640
Brother!

306
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:56,880
Brother

307
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,830
Don't come over

308
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:00,750
Don't come

309
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,990
You're like this...

310
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,600
Tell me brother

311
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,170
What should I do?

312
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,000
Be my legs

313
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,490
take my place,

314
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,680
Walking, running in the battlefield

315
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,790
That is your...

316
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,370
Retribution

317
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,100
Captain you're heading to the steam geysers!

318
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,890
The Strata Serpent is active.

319
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,030
I need the Dimensional Oscillation Warhead to be in manual mode

320
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:37,090
You noticed it, didn't you?

321
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:41,630
As long as you're on the Arcadia, you're my crew.

322
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,410
That idea was stupid.

323
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,010
I'm not here just to join your crew,

324
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,050
My mission is to kill you!

325
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,110
Is this what you want to do?

326
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,840
The likelihood of survival is less than one ten thousandth of the task

327
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,480
Even if you succeed no one will praise you.

328
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,120
Only a fool would follow such orders.

329
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,130
You're on your own now.

330
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,380
Why's there been no contact yet?

331
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,850
There's no signal on any of the radio frequencies.

332
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,920
We can't confirm if they're still alive.

333
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,720
Why did the Captain have to get involved?

334
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,070
We would do the same in his place.

335
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,210
Trust in him.

336
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,740
Captain,

337
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,860
If you die...

338
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,970
I'm not willingly doing this,

339
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:09,640
I'm not...

340
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,240
Freedom

341
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,200
You said that when you boarded the Arcadia.

342
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,800
That is...

343
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,920
If what you say is true,

344
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,360
Fight against the shackles that bind you

345
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,290
If that doesn't kill me,

346
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,680
Do it again.

347
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:40,980
Maybe you can kill me.

348
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,030
I wanted to give you 2 or 3 punches...

349
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,860
But forget it.

350
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,999
What matters is that you returned home safely.

351
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,980
Fight against the shackles that bind you...

352
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,850
So, now we've managed to deploy a couple of the bombs,

353
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,530
We can finally go to on our next target.

354
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,010
0 degrees galactic latitude...

355
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,150
Humanity's Home.

356
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:06,170
Earth

357
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,390
Earth

358
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,730
Earth

359
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,030
Earth

360
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:39,370
The Arcadia is heading towards Earth's solar system,

361
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:42,050
And is now underway

362
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,990
Your Fleet has not contacted you.

363
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,260
Communications are interrupted.

364
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,990
Don't let them get close to the Earth.

365
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,830
Please allow us to use the "Kaleido Star System"

366
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,480
I will destroy the Arcadia myself.

367
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,160
"Kaleido Star System"?

368
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:07,600
Using collapsed neutron star material needs concentrated light energy.

369
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,310
a resource contolled by the government.

370
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:19,410
However, Harlock's Dimensional Oscillation Warheads can destroy worlds

371
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,390
His warheads need Junction Points.

372
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,170
which are not readily available.

373
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,610
Using the "Kaleido Star System" will ensure our victory.

374
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,610
The last time it destroyed everything.

375
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:38,830
Soldiers engaged in a never-ending war?

376
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:42,810
Your Lordship what's your decision?

377
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,620
The use of the "Kaleido Star System" is permitted.

378
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,530
Use all means to stop him.

379
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,360
Even if it's the best idea we've got it'll disrupt communications

380
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:19,840
I'm always prepared with battleplans

381
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,960
Like intending to abandon him?

382
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:27,170
How can you do this?

383
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,280
Gaia Coalition Command

384
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,230
Order to all warships of the Gaia Fleet

385
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:02,400
Entire Fleet, make ready to sail

386
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,240
Repeat, entire Fleet, make ready to sail

387
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:07,520
Unlock all warships

388
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,670
All ships, set systems ready for departure

389
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,540
Once Fleet co-ordinates received

390
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,360
Gejian Fleet, begin departure

391
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:19,190
45 minutes in the high-speed optical furnace. Re-fuelling completed.

392
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,000
"Oceanus". Configuration coordinate positioning now completed.

393
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,810
I was Fleet Commander Lu Wali's aide

394
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,690
According to the orders of Commander Ezra

395
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,610
The whole Gejian Fleet is to go into Jump

396
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,080
and then the battle begins

397
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:47,000
Waiting for your order

398
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,830
We will now engage the Arcadia.

399
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,640
Prepare for battle!!

400
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:57,580
Roger

401
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,750
Fleet Gejian has verified their coordinate links

402
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,530
Large number of asteriods spotted outside the area.

403
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,370
Begin Jump

404
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:38,040
My friends,

405
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,970
This is the final voyage of your journey

406
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,040
Confused?

407
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:49,180
I don't understand.

408
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,730
Red Alert! Enemy fleet approaching!

409
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:58,970
Most of the enemy ships are in front with a distance of about 36,000km

410
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,380
The asteroid debris should have been a good line of defense

411
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:03,990
How did they come from the rear?

412
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,300
They traveled here at sub-light speed.

413
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,650
A nasty trick.

414
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:11,620
Do we engage them?

415
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:15,890
Affirmative.

416
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:19,070
Let's give them a warm welcome.

417
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:20,520
Understand.

418
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,220
Dark Matter increasing to maximum output

419
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,730
Broad cannons ready.

420
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:30,450
Deploying turrets in active mode

421
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,370
It's really quite a grand welcome.

422
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:50,400
Arcadia's position still registering as ahead

423
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,650
They're heading towards the asteriod debris.

424
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,750
We're ready to force a breakthrough

425
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:59,200
They've activated the Dark Matter Shield

426
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:08,980
Guns are now in range of the Arcadia

427
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:13,330
We're awaiting your order

428
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:14,930
Wait...

429
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,340
Just a little more...

430
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:27,490
Brother

431
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:33,010
Now!

432
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,200
Fleet, fire at will!

433
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,820
The warships are shelling each other.  We're losing ships!

434
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,130
The target is nowhere to be found!

435
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,350
Hold your fire!

436
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:57,080
We have an emergency situation

437
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:58,750
A hologram?

438
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:03,920
A clever plan...

439
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:08,010
Arcadia spotted heading for Saturn

440
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,320
Commander

441
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:12,250
2nd Fleet, use Jump to get there

442
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,610
Ships within a radius of 7400km, a total of 136 enemy units

443
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:33,790
Very close

444
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,900
Were not safe yet

445
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,210
The enemy did a stupid thing.

446
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:42,000
Yama

447
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,370
Incoming transmission from Arcadia.

448
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:51,780
Using Gaia Fleet's access code.

449
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:53,960
Connected.

450
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:56,430
Brother

451
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,220
You're still alive

452
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:00,440
Please back off your Fleet.

453
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:03,680
Harlock's mission is not to destroy the Universe.

454
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:05,460
His plans go far beyond what you think.

455
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,880
Just listen to me.

456
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,430
Is that all you can say?

457
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,770
I'm very disappointed.

458
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:14,550
Disconnect.

459
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:15,760
Brother

460
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,110
Transport the "Kaleido Star System".

461
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,630
The collapsed neutron star,

462
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,520
Is converted into a powerful light source.

463
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,420
As long as it maintains its massive photon energy output then,

464
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,000
the Arcadia won't have a chance.

465
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,860
2nd Fleet 84-93

466
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:10,990
Flank the Arcadia on both sides

467
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,350
Use light to dispel darkness.

468
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:17,450
This will be a huge battle all over again

469
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,060
A powerful gravitational field has appeared outside the Fleet

470
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,180
What?

471
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:32,620
It's huge

472
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:35,000
I can't give you an estimate

473
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:40,230
Critical light

474
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:41,880
Irradiate!

475
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,730
Debris increasing...

476
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,710
Raising shields to maximum output

477
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:19,400
Photon light gradually in cool down.

478
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,040
Alert! Incoming debris impact!

479
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,610
Intense electromagnetic interference, cannot activate remote sensors

480
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,800
Approximately 2 minutes to reboot.

481
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:27,640
Report target's status.

482
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:30,790
Using full telephoto global scan and spectroscopic scan

483
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:35,710
Arcadia is nowhere to be found!

484
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,590
Disappeared?

485
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,320
No trace found.

486
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,050
Was it still a holographic projection?

487
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:44,780
How?

488
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,640
They were very close to the target zone.

489
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,370
Arcadia detected above!

490
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:07,790
What?

491
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:17,500
The battleships are too slow to turn around in time.

492
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:24,600
Heavy cruiser "Nei Lede" completely destroyed

493
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:27,340
"Ares" also suffered heavy damage

494
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,980
Close the gap between the warships. Immediate action

495
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:50,840
Gravitational perturbations from the Arcadia have changed

496
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:51,930
It's heading here...

497
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:53,730
The Arcadia is here

498
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,370
Yama

499
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:25,090
97% of the Fleet warships have suffered major damage

500
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:28,930
Including the "Oceanus", only 17 ships are functioning

501
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,560
Try to hold on

502
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:57,470
Brother, it's useless to resist

503
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:20,910
Gaia Fleet's flagship looks very 'inspiring'

504
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,240
You need to abandon it

505
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:26,940
The "Oceanus" will be used to hold captives

506
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:30,270
Inform the Gaia Coalition that we have hostages

507
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,170
Good job.

508
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:34,100
Thanks to you, brother

509
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,660
You lured Joint Fleet Operations according to what I've told you

510
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:42,120
I'm only doing this for her

511
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,150
It's Nami

512
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,510
Keep her out of this

513
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:51,620
I want to take a gamble.

514
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:55,260
Humans can start over again

515
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:56,590
Thus, we have to...

516
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:57,530
Start over?

517
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:04,330
You don't understand anything

518
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:13,970
We're about to enter the Earth's field of protection

519
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,000
After a hundred years,

520
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,570
We return to our home planet

521
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:41,430
As a Junction Point in the Earth,

522
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:44,490
Here we can start over.

523
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,180
How do we install the Dimensional Oscillation Warhead on the Earth?

524
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,930
Earth is not meant to be blown.

525
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,850
The Captain will decide what to do.

526
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:57,060
Just trust in him.

527
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,850
Harlock is deceiving you guys.

528
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,220
When we enter the field of the inviolability

529
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:08,360
You'll see what I mean.

530
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:20,030
What's that?

531
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:28,340
A hologram. It's a holographic projection...

532
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,110
That means...

533
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,290
This...

534
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,470
Harlock committed a great sin

535
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:54,970
The blue surface is actually a holographic projection satellite illusion?

536
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,350
Captain

537
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,270
A hundred years ago,

538
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,230
Humans were scattered throughout the universe

539
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,080
and the Earth was the centre of a return to war

540
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,330
"The Homecoming War"

541
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:22,230
Tired of tragic human conflicts

542
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:28,050
The Gaia Coalition wanted to end the war

543
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,980
The Earth is our "holy land"

544
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:35,850
Regardless of what people do, this planet cannot be violated

545
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:43,620
Then, the Earth was guarded by the Gaia Fleet

546
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:47,490
Solar Federation Officer Captain Harlock was on board the battlecruiser "Death Shadow"

547
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:48,910
Harlock?

548
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:54,380
The Death Shadow was equipped with the Dark Matter Energy fuelling their warships

549
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:56,990
It was simply an armada

550
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:01,000
Planning to resurrect the lost alien civilizations

551
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,660
Harlock met Toshiro, a former Solar Federation Officer

552
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:07,420
They became good friends.

553
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:18,360
We told him the impending doom of our race, he wanted to save it.

554
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,120
We agreed to preserve our heritage

555
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,720
Harlock continued to defend the Earth

556
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:53,240
But the Gaia Coalition is giving special treatment to immigrant politicians.

557
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:57,990
That was the exchange for peace

558
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,960
Beautiful words can not end the war

559
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,390
But,

560
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,980
This man launched a revolt

561
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,950
and the Earth is the only shrine

562
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:41,260
It convinced Harlock to start fighting

563
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,280
He hated Gaia Coalition's betrayal

564
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:46,640
Toshiro!

565
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:50,360
So the Gaia Coalition turned against him.

566
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,130
Toshiro

567
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:11,070
Harlock was cornered.

568
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,620
He threatened to use the Dark Matter Energy

569
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:18,910
If Dark Matter Energy covered the Earth, then...

570
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:22,580
the Earth would truly be inviolable

571
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:26,620
That's how dangerous this thing is

572
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:29,900
It had to be prevented...

573
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,010
But it didn't happen as Harlock expected.

574
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:14,840
Dark Matter Energy converted the earth itself

575
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,730
The Earth was mercilessly devoured

576
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,140
And everything ended.

577
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,600
Everyone is gone,

578
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:34,400
But...

579
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,340
The man rose up

580
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:41,160
Not the same Harlock that we knew.

581
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:45,980
The ship had changed, transformed into a cursed pirate warship

582
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:56,790
By the end of the 5th year of war

583
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:02,190
The Gaia Coalition was pursuing him

584
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,890
and then Harlock disappeared

585
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:07,040
That purpose...

586
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:12,370
With the extinction of the Nibelung race throughout the worlds...

587
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:15,640
the Gaia Coalition would have come to an end.

588
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:18,750
That man...

589
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,510
Could not bear the burden and wanted to end all evil

590
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:26,830
Yama

591
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,120
What would you do?

592
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:39,970
What will become of the universe?

593
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:48,100
This infinitely large bubble called the universe...

594
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:52,750
A space node will act like a cork

595
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,140
If you pull the plug,

596
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,450
Everything will return to nothing,

597
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,800
Then be reborn again

598
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,470
So this is it!

599
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:07,640
No other way

600
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:10,510
Humans,

601
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:14,890
After all, the history of the universe appears only in a quick moment.

602
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,370
Whether or not, in the sense that it exists,

603
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:19,490
There still exists hope,

604
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:23,260
Which can't simply be annihilated

605
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:26,050
I fear for the time

606
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,100
people will again target the Earth

607
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,740
The home planet that gave birth to all.

608
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,250
Back to that era of ignorance

609
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:42,120
which contains infinite possibilities...

610
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,110
But that Earth is useless now.

611
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:50,540
Doing it all over.

612
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,790
Earth is all we had.

613
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,430
But it gave me a cursed ship

614
01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:00,370
It awarded me for immortality.

615
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:03,620
But that doesn't compsenate for those I lost

616
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,900
It's not your fault!

617
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:06,720
If only,

618
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:10,830
We could bring back the dead

619
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:13,190
Then all will be well in the world.

620
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:14,080
Kei

621
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,670
The restoration of Humanity...

622
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,460
How?

623
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:25,800
Harlock

624
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,300
Don't carry the burden by yourself

625
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,190
We are here to help you.

626
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:36,030
Miime

627
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:40,000
What is this?

628
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,800
We're moving away from the Earth

629
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:44,630
Who's doing this?

630
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,130
My friends...

631
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:52,970
You're betraying me now?

632
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:04,250
The "Oceanus'" engines are under way

633
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:05,750
They are in the engine room!

634
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:07,760
All the prisoners have escaped!

635
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:08,350
How?

636
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:09,940
Fast Report

637
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,750
Emergency compartment closed!

638
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:13,560
The captives are armed with weapons!

639
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:16,920
Don't let them enter the bridge!

640
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:33,480
You!

641
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:39,550
Kei said it before

642
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,840
Mediocrity is better to die...

643
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:45,760
Everyone is the same

644
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:49,710
Maybe someone looking forward to the end all of this

645
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:51,240
But,

646
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:59,120
So, is this your answer?

647
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:01,200
Probably...

648
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:04,250
You are immortal

649
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:07,990
Not all things can be killed

650
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:10,930
This cursed body is all that remains

651
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:23,810
Space Criminal Code S-OO999

652
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:25,660
Harlock

653
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:30,980
Has violated the Article 62, terrorizing and bringing terror in the universe,

654
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:33,650
You're under arrest.

655
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:40,340
Breaking news has been received,

656
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,910
Gaia Coalition has an announcement.

657
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:51,150
The 100-year-old fugitive who hindered the peace agreement,

658
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:55,570
Space Pirate Captain Harlock and his crew of 40 people,

659
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,320
have been arrested by the Gaia Fleet.

660
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:39,350
You are now in charge of the Central Command.

661
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:41,400
Brother

662
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:42,090
Where's Nami?

663
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:44,940
Stay away from her.

664
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:02,470
Why is he still looking for you?

665
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:06,670
Forget it.

666
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,270
I already knew.

667
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:12,210
Your heart belongs only to Yama

668
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,480
You know nothing.

669
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:25,180
The way you respond to me...

670
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,710
You want to eliminate hatred?

671
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:30,290
Don't say something nice!

672
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:40,550
Look at this

673
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,090
In my own way,

674
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:46,120
I've done this just for you

675
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:22,520
I regretted that day,

676
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:26,350
Why him?

677
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:31,150
Now you're aware of this

678
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:36,370
Your pain is not Yama's fault

679
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:37,930
I...

680
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:48,140
always loved Yama, your brother

681
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:50,790
This can't be

682
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:52,270
I wanted to eliminate your hatred

683
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:53,370
That's enough! Don't say it!

684
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:54,480
This needs to end!

685
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:55,820
Stop it!

686
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:22,780
I lied to you

687
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,490
I'm sorry, Ezra

688
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:33,590
Nami...

689
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,990
You're my favorite

690
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:42,420
I know that.

691
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,620
It is most likely you

692
01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:20,400
Fool...

693
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:23,000
Fool!

694
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,120
Fool! Fool!

695
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:27,750
FOOL!

696
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:46,890
It's Nami's

697
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:50,900
Use this to communicate with her

698
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,550
A virus invaded her network

699
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:54,040
It seems

700
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:57,460
Her life support system malfunctioned

701
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:02,750
It's a pity

702
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:04,840
This can't be...

703
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,420
Ezra what did you do!

704
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:17,110
Look, Yama

705
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:20,850
This is the only planet where flowers grow

706
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:24,350
Your mother's flower.

707
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:28,880
Turned out strong. it blooms beautifully

708
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:32,280
I've tried to persuade Ezra,

709
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,330
To let me handle the greenhouse cultivation.

710
01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:37,420
I hope you will look after these flowers too.

711
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:42,110
Even if you don't like it.

712
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,110
No matter how hard,

713
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:49,250
Embrace your own pain.

714
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,320
If possible,

715
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,100
break through it

716
01:12:55,930 --> 01:12:56,930
And also,

717
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:01,150
Ezra has been always at my side

718
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:05,810
His gentleness made ??me feel at ease.

719
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:10,330
I chose Ezra.

720
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:13,360
So don't blame yourself.

721
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:02,030
Some day, if you meet that important person,

722
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:03,110
remember me.

723
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,500
We are family.

724
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,680
You look very weak.

725
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:25,530
As expected.

726
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:28,760
This afternoon,

727
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,030
You will be executed.

728
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,430
Your source of immortality,

729
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,480
The Dark Matter Energy has failed you this time.

730
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:38,930
The curse you have been given will be removed.

731
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:40,900
It's futile.

732
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:44,090
What's your goal?

733
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:49,190
Could it be you want to re-do it again?

734
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,660
Everybody knows that's not possible.

735
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:56,330
I have to rely on others

736
01:14:58,870 --> 01:14:59,590
In that case...

737
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:02,910
No matter who it is...

738
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:13,230
Good luck with that...

739
01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:15,220
Freedom

740
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:21,230
Today,

741
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:25,910
Soon, the universe's Space Pirate Captain Harlock and his crew,

742
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:29,200
will accept the merciful gift of the death rituals of Gaia

743
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,640
The communications network between galaxies, live from the Gaia Coalition, will broadcast the event.

744
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:39,510
By now most of the Elders have taken their offical positions

745
01:15:42,490 --> 01:15:44,940
High Supreme Court of Gaia

746
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:47,700
Order and peace

747
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:50,400
Order and peace

748
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:52,860
Our Home planet

749
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,380
Mother Earth

750
01:15:56,570 --> 01:15:57,240
Gaia

751
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:02,100
who scattered her children throughout this universe

752
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:04,960
shines forever

753
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,550
Her children sleep

754
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,230
Until that day

755
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:13,370
Even if...

756
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:15,950
It's as fantastic as...

757
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:19,590
Their nonsense speeches are just a waste

758
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:22,970
We're just puppets to him

759
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,810
You guys already know it

760
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:26,580
What did you say?!

761
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:28,760
I have a plan.

762
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:30,460
What is it?

763
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:33,860
Obviously we have no place on this planet,

764
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,790
only on the pirate ship.

765
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:40,360
There's this problem,

766
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:41,350
What is it?

767
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,350
The Captain doesn't care if we live or die.

768
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:51,750
You're just like Yama

769
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:53,830
You're worse!

770
01:16:54,830 --> 01:16:56,560
You're not qualified to complain!

771
01:16:57,170 --> 01:16:58,810
Like you, I'm also

772
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:03,610
desperate to explain the Captain's objectives

773
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:08,490
Execution will commence

774
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,500
Guard ship to main exit

775
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:12,910
Repeat

776
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:15,630
Guard ship to main exit

777
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,010
Hey, we've been ordered to fall back

778
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:22,900
What's with that guy?

779
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:25,490
Commence field collapse

780
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:27,270
Commence Singularity, maintain barriers

781
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:29,680
Osmotic field on, quantum gravity diverse state maintained

782
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,000
Spatial collapse rate rising to predetermined level

783
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:33,870
Spatial collapse rate has risen to critical point

784
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:34,970
Reduce pressure

785
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:37,210
Breakthrough properties will begin shortly

786
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,230
Execution will start in

787
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:47,320
10 seconds

788
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,940
Pressure units have exploded!

789
01:18:07,330 --> 01:18:08,010
All readings are off scale!

790
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:09,830
Dark Matter Energy released!

791
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:18,990
Get out!

792
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:20,870
What are you doing ?

793
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:22,370
I was wrong

794
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:23,840
Right now?!

795
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,360
Not only the Gaia Coalition is wrong

796
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:29,250
Harlock, everyone is wrong

797
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:32,440
Go down to Earth, you'll understand what I mean.

798
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:35,600
There's something I need you to see.

799
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:37,950
Why do we believe in this guy?

800
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:38,970
I'll tell you after this.

801
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,650
The guards will soon come

802
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:43,250
Let the ship escape

803
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:48,400
Hey, do you believe in him?

804
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,780
Stay here and you'll die

805
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:51,950
Come

806
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:53,320
I hate this

807
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:58,820
Switch to the screen inside the ship

808
01:18:59,040 --> 01:18:59,540
Yes!

809
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:05,860
How is this possible?

810
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:07,450
Rebellion...

811
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:09,670
It was a hindered execution

812
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,130
Quickly terminate the broadcast!

813
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,270
Dispose them at once!

814
01:19:13,930 --> 01:19:14,460
I understand.

815
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,780
Space squadron!

816
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:21,000
Obliterate all "Arcadia" crew members!

817
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:44,580
I'm not going to run anymore!

818
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,480
We need your help to escape the ship

819
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,100
Captain, fight it!

820
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:04,870
You said this ship is unable to move

821
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:05,720
Hurry!

822
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:08,320
Stand up Captain!

823
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,710
You may indeed have destroyed mankind's Home planet,

824
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:17,870
But you gave us shelter

825
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:18,820
That's the ship

826
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:22,990
There is no other place for us.

827
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:28,220
Harlock.

828
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:32,170
Please take a look.

829
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:43,750
This flower is

830
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:46,110
Earth's hope

831
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:53,640
Hey, how the...

832
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:58,690
There are signs Earth is regenerating

833
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:02,930
Nothing has ended, this is the beginning.

834
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:07,430
Even if we destroy the flower...

835
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:09,780
Fertilitize the world

836
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:11,230
No matter how many times you try to revive it,

837
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,080
Even humans can have hope

838
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:17,990
Repeat the event...

839
01:21:21,530 --> 01:21:22,810
Forever

840
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:27,950
This is...

841
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:30,900
Freedom

842
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:12,170
My crew...

843
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,040
The Dark Matter Energy is continuing to increase

844
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:39,020
We're unable to absorb it

845
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:14,160
Where did the ship go?

846
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:17,510
In the direction it's taken...

847
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:19,370
...it's heading for Earth?

848
01:23:24,230 --> 01:23:26,710
Mobilize all forces in the solar system

849
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:29,210
Prevent the "Arcadia" from going near the Earth!

850
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:32,940
What's the status of the "Oceanus"?

851
01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:34,430
Repairs are not yet completed,

852
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:35,980
But it can get under way

853
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:36,510
Yes, sir!

854
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,120
Amazing, this ship moves by itself...

855
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:55,560
The coordinates of the Earth?

856
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:58,340
Could it be the "End Point"?

857
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:00,600
Yattaran

858
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:04,630
The Gaia Coalition is communicating over the galaxy networks

859
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:08,970
Hyperspace communications should be able to communicate, simultaneously throughout the universe

860
01:24:13,660 --> 01:24:17,810
From now on the ship will be fighting against the strength of the Earth's satellite hologram

861
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:22,340
n order to reveal the truth to the whole universe.

862
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:26,970
Yama

863
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:29,170
Convey to the people,

864
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:31,410
The true face of the Earth

865
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:45,380
I never expected this...

866
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:48,380
Prepare the ship for combat!

867
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:12,670
I've lost count again

868
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:14,460
Our goal is the hologram satellite

869
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,840
Ignore them.

870
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,440
Yattaran, it's not good!

871
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:19,560
It's not that simple

872
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:34,820
They're removing the hologram satellite

873
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:37,190
Don't let them succeed!

874
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,380
Their central hull armour is critical!

875
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:54,660
Yattaran!

876
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,250
Alright then,

877
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:59,350
Come come come come come!!!

878
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:03,560
Linking to Gaia Coalition galactic communications network

879
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:05,020
Success!

880
01:26:07,150 --> 01:26:07,670
Yama...

881
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:29,160
We can't avoid it!

882
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:49,020
This is the "Arcadia"

883
01:26:50,370 --> 01:26:52,270
To all the people from around the universe...

884
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:55,500
Don't look away

885
01:26:57,110 --> 01:27:00,000
See it with your eyes

886
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,640
The Gaia Coalition wants to hide the truth

887
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:05,560
The true face of the Earth

888
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:08,150
Because of past wars...

889
01:27:08,650 --> 01:27:10,900
The beautiful planet was turned into this

890
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:13,160
Stop the broadcast!

891
01:27:16,330 --> 01:27:16,860
But...

892
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:19,250
do not despair.

893
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:22,330
Earth is still alive

894
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:26,720
The land of the dead has regained new life

895
01:27:27,930 --> 01:27:29,260
This kind of life is extremely fragile

896
01:27:30,130 --> 01:27:31,210
But we must nurture it

897
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:35,040
In repeating the cycle,

898
01:27:37,570 --> 01:27:39,280
Don't just rely on dreams.

899
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:42,240
Don't be afraid to accept the truth.

900
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:45,670
We can take our first real step.

901
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,340
We are not alone.

902
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:51,940
Even if our race is dead

903
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:54,220
Life will continue to grow.

904
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:56,740
Look in front of you.

905
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:58,820
Our last hope

906
01:28:00,330 --> 01:28:01,350
All the life

907
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:03,590
In this thing

908
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:05,710
is there forever!

909
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:10,910
That's really stupid!

910
01:28:11,530 --> 01:28:15,930
In this situation the order of the universe will collapse

911
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:19,770
Stop that "Arcadia" as soon as possible!

912
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:21,970
Do not panic.

913
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:29,560
The use of the "Jovian Blaster" is permitted.

914
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:36,410
"Jovian Blaster"?

915
01:28:38,170 --> 01:28:41,200
For the sake of the "The Homecoming War",

916
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:47,420
complete your mission using this ultimate weapon

917
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:49,080
But...

918
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,620
The "Arcadia" is in the Earth's orbit

919
01:28:51,650 --> 01:28:52,160
Earth will...

920
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:54,400
That sacred place is

921
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:58,470
No longer inhabitable.

922
01:28:59,470 --> 01:29:01,750
We need to consider making it a sacrfice.

923
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:03,600
Please wait! Your Lordship!

924
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:06,370
Order the Fleet to fall back, Ezra.

925
01:29:13,070 --> 01:29:15,070
Hostile ships retreating...

926
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:16,260
I don't get it.

927
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,320
That Gaia Fleet guy

928
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:20,810
Wants to give up?

929
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,110
One ship approaching...

930
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:25,690
The "Oceanus"!

931
01:29:31,970 --> 01:29:32,490
Ezra

932
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:59,450
The ship is prepared to withstand any shock!

933
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:22,170
Why is this happening?

934
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:25,650
The enemy has grappled the ship!

935
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:32,580
Is it charged yet?

936
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:35,840
They'll pay for this!

937
01:31:17,570 --> 01:31:18,990
Kei, are you alright?

938
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:28,310
This is not your style at the moment...

939
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:30,960
Yattaran!

940
01:31:44,930 --> 01:31:48,050
I'm not running away anymore!

941
01:31:58,940 --> 01:31:59,820
Ezra, where are you?

942
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,310
Get out of my way!

943
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:08,400
Rail loop electromagnetic poles on boot

944
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,150
"Jovian Blaster's" rotation speed increasing

945
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:13,630
Situation report update

946
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:16,590
Centrifugal-free transition to the excited state of atmospheric plasma

947
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:20,290
"Jovian Blaster" charged at 60%

948
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:22,830
Rotation rate still rising

949
01:32:23,970 --> 01:32:26,120
Jupiter will gradually deform...

950
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:30,270
180 seconds before critical output achieved

951
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:34,640
"Oceanus" and "Arcadia" must keep each other busy

952
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:36,430
Proceeding...

953
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:37,950
Never mind

954
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:41,880
I wish we had more to spare

955
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:18,350
"Do not despair"?

956
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:21,650
You're now a saviour, Yama ?

957
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:23,190
Where are you Ezra?

958
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,930
You couldn't even save the woman you love.

959
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,870
You? Save mankind? What a joke.

960
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:42,680
I've got you now.

961
01:34:51,690 --> 01:34:53,330
You are so naive

962
01:34:54,770 --> 01:34:56,160
With your mother's flower,

963
01:34:56,690 --> 01:34:59,070
In this situation you haven't any hope!

964
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:02,190
But the flower...

965
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:03,490
bloomed!

966
01:35:05,130 --> 01:35:06,260
You're too late!

967
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:13,640
If not for you, Nami would not be dead!

968
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:09,090
That test beam,

969
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,790
was shot from Jupiter

970
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:16,730
"Arcadia", along with the Earth will be destroyed

971
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:22,410
You...

972
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:28,620
Captain, please go

973
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:34,030
Miime has been able to

974
01:36:38,050 --> 01:36:39,350
protect the Earth.

975
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:44,150
She's doing this for a long time.

976
01:36:57,390 --> 01:37:00,120
We can't completely control it.

977
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:04,250
The results from the test firing look excellent.

978
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:07,260
To end "The Homecoming War"

979
01:37:07,790 --> 01:37:09,490
this is our only way.

980
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:11,230
Resetting almost complete!

981
01:37:12,940 --> 01:37:15,960
The second plasma energy level now at 95%

982
01:37:16,190 --> 01:37:17,550
approaching target value

983
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:33,380
Preparing to open the force field!

984
01:38:20,690 --> 01:38:23,850
Hyperspace tracking locking on to the target

985
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:26,220
Targeting "Arcadia"

986
01:38:26,670 --> 01:38:28,430
Automatic tracking complete

987
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:32,160
This one is the last,

988
01:38:34,010 --> 01:38:36,260
There are enough worlds for us

989
01:38:37,230 --> 01:38:41,770
After all, our life is not yet ended.

990
01:38:47,870 --> 01:38:48,690
Harlock

991
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:51,980
This is...

992
01:38:53,860 --> 01:38:55,020
Sorry Miime

993
01:38:56,460 --> 01:38:57,200
For you...

994
01:38:58,790 --> 01:38:59,880
It's alright.

995
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:02,300
I feel your sufferings.

996
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:06,440
Just continue doing what you believe in.

997
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:10,700
Even if there's a price to pay.

998
01:39:18,770 --> 01:39:21,890
This is the only way to save mankind.

999
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,220
This can't be.

1000
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:28,720
What happened?

1001
01:41:29,730 --> 01:41:31,580
They changed the course of the beam

1002
01:41:31,690 --> 01:41:33,690
Preventing it from hitting the Earth.

1003
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:35,690
"Oceanus"

1004
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:38,640
Ezra

1005
01:42:03,650 --> 01:42:05,540
Deflecting the beam from hitting the Earth

1006
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:08,210
Instead it hit the "Arcadia"

1007
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:10,990
Why?

1008
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:14,540
I wanted to see

1009
01:42:17,230 --> 01:42:18,560
Nami's flowers

1010
01:42:21,050 --> 01:42:23,780
They're really beautiful

1011
01:42:45,610 --> 01:42:46,540
Brother

1012
01:42:48,110 --> 01:42:48,930
Brother!

1013
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:26,740
While the Earth is recovering,

1014
01:43:29,410 --> 01:43:32,430
the Government will once again take all the glory.

1015
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,930
"The Homecoming War" will happen again.

1016
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:40,860
Using this will prevent that from happening.

1017
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:46,540
Dark Matter Energy will be released.

1018
01:43:47,630 --> 01:43:49,770
Many will die.

1019
01:43:50,970 --> 01:43:51,470
You know it.

1020
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:56,820
This world is Nami and Ezra's inheritance

1021
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:02,710
Is that so?

1022
01:44:04,890 --> 01:44:08,280
If the Union makes mistakes again,

1023
01:44:11,130 --> 01:44:12,570
I will not hesitate to bring them...

1024
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:18,870
Curse and terror

1025
01:44:19,930 --> 01:44:21,870
Repeating the cycle again.

1026
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:26,530
As long as humans unite

1027
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:31,870
There will be hope and freedom

1028
01:44:34,130 --> 01:44:35,600
This should continue to exist,

1029
01:44:41,290 --> 01:44:42,290
Forever...

1030
01:44:54,210 --> 01:44:55,500
This is the Planetary Joint Army

1031
01:44:56,250 --> 01:44:57,480
Place yourself by the bridge

1032
01:44:58,060 --> 01:44:59,610
You are advised to surrender

1033
01:45:00,340 --> 01:45:02,220
All survivors leave the ship

1034
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:04,770
Quickly disarm yourselves.

1035
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:08,610
If you refuse to surrender,

1036
01:45:09,070 --> 01:45:10,890
We will resume our attack

1037
01:46:15,510 --> 01:46:18,690
Harlock was right in believing in you.

1038
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:24,890
The "Arcadia" will rise again...

1039
01:46:31,430 --> 01:46:32,390
The "Arcadia"!

1040
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:34,900
Full sail!

1041
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:08,310
<i>Human's recession</i>

1042
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:13,620
<i>There is nowhere to go forward</i>

1043
01:47:15,030 --> 01:47:16,830
<i>All is changed</i>

1044
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:24,540
<i>The man will continue his legacy</i>

1045
01:47:27,090 --> 01:47:32,110
<i>In order to bring hope and freedom</i>

1046
01:49:26,170 --> 01:49:28,600
<i><font color="#ffff00">Recall that day</font></i>

1047
01:49:26,170 --> 01:49:28,600
<i><font color="#ffff00">Just the thought of another day</font></i>

1048
01:49:29,090 --> 01:49:31,190
<i><font color="#ffff00">Why are we on this end</font></i>

1049
01:49:29,090 --> 01:49:31,190
<i><font color="#ffff00">How did we end up this way</font></i>

1050
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:35,480
<i><font color="#ffff00">What we've done</font></i>

1051
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:35,480
<i><font color="#ffff00">What did we do wrong?</font></i>

1052
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:38,230
<i><font color="#ffff00">God ah</font></i>

1053
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:38,230
<i><font color="#ffff00">God</font></i>

1054
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:55,260
<i><font color="#ffff00">Despite the rush hour flow to</font></i>

1055
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:55,260
<i><font color="#ffff00">Even though the days go on</font></i>

1056
01:49:55,310 --> 01:49:58,170
<i><font color="#ffff00">That day has long gone</font></i>

1057
01:49:55,310 --> 01:49:58,170
<i><font color="#ffff00">So far so far away from</font></i>

1058
01:49:58,230 --> 01:50:02,700
<i><font color="#ffff00">I still feel fresh in our memory</font></i>

1059
01:49:58,230 --> 01:50:02,700
<i><font color="#ffff00">It seems so close</font></i>

1060
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:07,020
<i><font color="#ffff00">Always makes me like shoulder the burden</font></i>

1061
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:07,020
<i><font color="#ffff00">Always weighing on my shoulder</font></i>

1062
01:50:07,190 --> 01:50:09,910
<i><font color="#ffff00">Extraordinary moment</font></i>

1063
01:50:07,190 --> 01:50:09,910
<i><font color="#ffff00">A time like no other</font></i>

1064
01:50:10,090 --> 01:50:12,880
<i><font color="#ffff00">That day changed everything</font></i>

1065
01:50:10,090 --> 01:50:12,880
<i><font color="#ffff00">It all changed on that day</font></i>

1066
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:15,720
<i><font color="#ffff00">Grief and endless pain</font></i>

1067
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:15,720
<i><font color="#ffff00">Sadness and so much pain</font></i>

1068
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:18,640
<i><font color="#ffff00">You can feel my sorrow</font></i>

1069
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:18,640
<i><font color="#ffff00">You can touch the sorrow here</font></i>

1070
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:22,350
<i><font color="#ffff00">I do not know what to blame</font></i>

1071
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:22,350
<i><font color="#ffff00">I don't know what to blame</font></i>

1072
01:50:22,590 --> 01:50:26,090
<i><font color="#ffff00">Just watched repeatedly in the side</font></i>

1073
01:50:22,590 --> 01:50:26,090
<i><font color="#ffff00">I just watch and watch again</font></i>

1074
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:30,430
<i><font color="#ffff00">Even if the flow of time to rush</font></i>

1075
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:30,430
<i><font color="#ffff00">Even though the days go on</font></i>

1076
01:50:30,510 --> 01:50:33,380
<i><font color="#ffff00">That day has long gone</font></i>

1077
01:50:30,510 --> 01:50:33,380
<i><font color="#ffff00">So far so far away from</font></i>

1078
01:50:33,410 --> 01:50:37,710
<i><font color="#ffff00">I still feel fresh in our memory</font></i>

1079
01:50:33,410 --> 01:50:37,710
<i><font color="#ffff00">It seems so close</font></i>

1080
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:42,200
<i><font color="#ffff00">Even if the flow of time to rush</font></i>

1081
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:42,200
<i><font color="#ffff00">Even though the days go on</font></i>

1082
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:45,110
<i><font color="#ffff00">That day has long gone</font></i>

1083
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:45,110
<i><font color="#ffff00">So far so far away from</font></i>

1084
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:49,440
<i><font color="#ffff00">I still feel fresh in our memory</font></i>

1085
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:49,440
<i><font color="#ffff00">It seems so close</font></i>

1086
01:50:51,830 --> 01:50:54,650
<i><font color="#ffff00">It is what is left</font></i>

1087
01:50:51,830 --> 01:50:54,650
<i><font color="#ffff00">What did it leave behind?</font></i>

1088
01:50:54,850 --> 01:51:01,080
<i><font color="#ffff00">And from here we take and erase what</font></i>

1089
01:50:54,850 --> 01:51:01,080
<i><font color="#ffff00">What did it take from us and wash away?</font></i>

1090
01:51:01,570 --> 01:51:02,510
<i><font color="#ffff00">Maybe a long way</font></i>

1091
01:51:01,570 --> 01:51:02,510
<i><font color="#ffff00">It may be long</font></i>

1092
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:05,380
<i><font color="#ffff00">But as long as we re 'heart' start</font></i>

1093
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:05,380
<i><font color="#ffff00">But with our hearts start a new</font></i>

1094
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:07,870
<i><font color="#ffff00">Keep the faith and never give up</font></i>

1095
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:07,870
<i><font color="#ffff00">And keep it up and not give up</font></i>

1096
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:12,760
<i><font color="#ffff00">And head forward</font></i>

1097
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:12,760
<i><font color="#ffff00">With our heads held high</font></i>

1098
01:51:13,710 --> 01:51:17,480
<i><font color="#ffff00">You have entered hell and come back again</font></i>

1099
01:51:13,710 --> 01:51:17,480
<i><font color="#ffff00">You have seen hell and made it back again</font></i>

1100
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:19,990
<i><font color="#ffff00">How to forget ? We can not forget</font></i>

1101
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:19,990
<i><font color="#ffff00">How to forget? We can't forget</font></i>
