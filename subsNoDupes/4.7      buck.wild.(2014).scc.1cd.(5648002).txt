00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:26,825
K vragu!

3
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,331
Halo?

4
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,071
Prokleti rakuni.

5
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:49,081
Sranje!

6
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:53,619
Tko je tamo?

7
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,257
Ima li koga?

8
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:18,477
Tatice! Oh!

9
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,879
Prokletstvo Candy!

10
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,215
Koliko puta ti moram reci?

11
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,119
O ne.

12
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,694
Moji tulipani.

13
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,329
Zbilja mi je zao, Clyde.

14
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:40,165
E sada ce ti tek biti zao!!!

15
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,271
Ne!

16
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,140
O!

17
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:50,409
Kako si mogao?!

18
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:51,777
Mi smo zaljubljeni tatice!

19
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,012
Htio me voditi u Novi Meksiko!

20
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,415
O Candy, 
idi u svoju prikolicu.

21
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:57,683
Ali mi smo zaljubljeni.

22
00:01:57,685 --> 00:02:00,285
Da. Odmah u kuću.

23
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,421
Rekao sam sada, kvragu!

24
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:04,123
Aah! 

25
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,325
Mrzim te!

26
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:08,961
Da pa,
to čini nas dvoje.

27
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,859
Prokletstvo Candy!

28
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,973
Dušo? Jesi to ti?

29
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,062
Chupacabra?

30
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,769
Aah! Chupacabra!

31
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,883
Hoćeš li molim te,
dati šansu našem putovanju?

32
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,518
Obećajem, zabaviti ćemo se.

33
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,087
Okej? Ha?

34
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,556
Samo mi društvo, ha?

35
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,226
Loviti ćemo okolo.

36
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,794
Kome pišeš?

37
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:51,196
Tvojoj curi.
Pozdravlja te.

38
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:03,642
Pa, ne želim biti davež...

39
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:06,011
..ali, bi li htio otvoriti prozor..

40
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:08,981
..ili ugasiti to?

41
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:12,384
Baš sam dobio ovu majicu
iz praonice.

42
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:16,188
I htio bih je nositi
više od jednog puta.

43
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,559
Ili napravi to, da

44
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,561
Hvala.

45
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,063
Tom, Jerry je iz New York-a.

46
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,531
Reci mu Jerry.

47
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,566
Da, 
ja sam iz New York-a.

48
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,668
Oh, zbilja?

49
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,870
Šta te dovodi u Texas,
Jerry?

50
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,506
Ah, Jerry je ovdije privremeno.

51
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:37,276
Samo dok ne riješi neke stvari.

52
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:38,577
Stvari?

53
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:41,013
Ah, kakve stvari?

54
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:43,615
Samo neke stvari,
koje sam trebao riješiti...

55
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,485
...kada sam imao šanse.

56
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,989
Reci, jel nebi bilo udobnije

57
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,225
ako stavimo tu veliku torbu u gepek?

58
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:56,895
Možda će ti biti lakše
jesti taj kikiriki.

59
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,297
Zapravo Tom,

60
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,599
meni bi bilo udobnije
da staviš tu veliku torbu iza.

61
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,277
Ja se samo zajebavam
sa tobom čovječe!

62
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,745
Tako si napet!

63
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,814
Skoro si upišao gaće Tom.

64
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:19,184
Ali da ti nikada nije palo na pamet
da diraš tu torbu--

65
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,554
NIKADA

66
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,025
Da li netko želi slatkoga?

67
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,861
Isuse. Šta-- jel kolači
imaju fufu u sebi, Lance?

68
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,730
Pa, Mama, tko još kaže "fufu"?

69
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,598
Ja ću uzeti jedan, šefe.

70
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,635
Ne!
Dečki, hajde. Dobro?

71
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,637
Gledajte, 
moramo ići u grad prvo,

72
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,905
a onda se moramo naći sa Clyde.

73
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:42,040
Tko je kvragu Clyde?
On.. 

74
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,209
On posjeduje Buck Wild ranč.

75
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,744
Pa, 
ja sam sa tobom, šefe.

76
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,312
I koju god životinju ubijemo,
ja ću guliti kožu

77
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:48,947
jer sam dobar sa nožem

78
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,217
Prokleto dobar.

79
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,694
Clyde --
zvuči super, Craig.

80
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,390
Ehm, zašto ja moram sjediti iza

81
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:33,191
sa Jeffreyem Dahmer (serijski ubojica)?

82
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,060
Oprostite dečki.
On je obitelj, okej?

83
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,528
I nezna nikoga ovdije

84
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,929
Vjerojatno,
jer ih je ubio sve.

85
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,866
I nagurao ih u svoju veliku torbu.

86
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,701
Zbilja --
jeste vidjeli kako je

87
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,035
dobro pazio na tu torbu?

88
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,904
Tip je ravno iz nekog
filma u kojem je on ubojica.

89
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,539
I šta je to sa kikirikijem?

90
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,074
Kao da radi na novoj protezi.

91
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,177
Okej gledajte,
znam da je malo "napet"?

92
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,678
ali, dajte malo popustite

93
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,314
i samo mu dajte šansu, okej?

94
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,963
Oh, slatko.

95
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,682
Nisam ja za ovo.

96
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,562
Dobar dan, gospodo.

97
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:46,198
Jel mi se priviđa od nih kolača.

98
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,633
Dobar dan, hm, gospon..

99
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,702
Ima li problema?
Da, zapravo ima.

100
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,972
Parkirao si na mojoj pumpi.

101
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,707
Tvojoj pumpi?

102
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,009
Da,vidiš,
ja sam čovjek što ljudi ovdije

103
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,046
zovu "jebač"
izvan zakona zapravo,

104
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:04,082
i sa time,
zaslužujem određenu slobodu.

105
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:07,118
U ovom slučaju,
odabrao sam ovu pumpu kao MOJU pumpu.

106
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,589
I zato vas tražim,
da maknete svoj jebeni kamion.

107
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:11,923
Hej, Billy Ray!

108
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,658
Jedan se skriva ovdije!

109
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,427
Prestani se skrivati!

110
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:17,329
Prestani se skrivati!

111
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,331
Prestani se skrivati!

112
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,635
Gledajte gospodo,

113
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:26,004
Vidim da niste odavdije.

114
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,540
Pa ću vam dopustiti da odete dostojanstveno.

115
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,076
A da?
A šta ako nećemo?

116
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,748
Da,
definitivno su kolači.

117
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,451
Užasno mi je žao gospodo.

118
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:42,187
Uvijek gubim ključeve,
znate.

119
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,090
Ajmo probati ponovno.

120
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,525
samo malo.

121
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,361
Hej. ne želimo probleme, 
okej?

122
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,930
Pa, izgleda da imamo probleme.

123
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:55,033
Ovo je glupo.
Jerry, maknuti ćemo se.

124
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,568
Ili možemo ostati

125
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,438
A gosp. Kikiriki ovdije
i njegova grupa "Dixie Chicks"
mogu tankirati negdije drugdije.

126
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,743
Šta se ovdije dešava dečki?

127
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,279
Samo bezopasno
muško razmetanje, shipley.

128
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:08,813
Aha.

129
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,882
Izgleda kao par mladića
koji obilježavaju svoj teritorij.

130
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,851
I kaže se poručnik Shipley,
Billy ray.

131
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,853
Koliko puta ti to moram reći?

132
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,856
Koja je tvoja priča, sine?

133
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,959
Hej!

134
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:24,296
Poručnik Teksaškog parka
ti se obraća, dečko.

135
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:25,497
Lovočuvar Shipley?

136
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,599 
Bok. Craig Thompson.

137
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,238
Ma, samo uzimamo benzin,

138
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,107
I onda idemo do našeg
vodiča na Buck Wild ranč.

139
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,276
Idete upoznati Clyde-a?

140
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,579
To je on.
Sranje. Kužim.

141
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:41,980
Pa, kada ga vidite,

142
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,215
pitajte ga da li je vidio
"Chupacabre" u posljednje vrijeme .

143
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,695
U redu dečki, magla .

144
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:59,097
I, Billy Ray...

145
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,600
Držim te na oku.

146
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,941
Vjerujem,
da ćemo se sresti ponovno

147
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,476
pisano je.

148
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,294
Šta je "chupacabra"?

149
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,296
Mislim da je rekao
"chalupa."

150
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,765
Rekao je "chupacabra."

151
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,100
To je legendarno stvorenje

152
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,636
glasine su da je nastanjivao
dijelove Amerike.

153
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,271
Ozloglašen chupacabra,
ili "Goat Sucker,"

154
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,207
pije krv svojim žrtvama.

155
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,676
Neki kažu da je samo
pobješnjeli kojot sa šugom.

156
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:48,346
Drugi se kunu da je čisto zlo.

157
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:51,082
Kako dovraga ti znaš to sve?

158
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:54,786
Pa, petljao sam prije sa
Meksikankom farmericom.

159
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,893
Bok.

160
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:04,229
Jesi ti Clyde?

161
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,934
Jesi ti Clyde
sa Buck Wild ranča?

162
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:16,841
Hm.

163
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:20,578
Moje ime je --
Craig Thompson.

164
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,480
Pa, ti si Clyde.

165
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,916
Drago mi je što sam vas upoznao, gospodine .

166
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,918
Lovočuvar,
iz grada --

167
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,356
me zamolio
da vas pitam o, uh, chupacabri?

168
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,294
Sine, jel se ti praviš pametan?

169
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,529
Hm, ne, gospodine.

170
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,831
Je li ti netko rekao
da Buck Wild ranč

171
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,400
prima aplikacije za pametnjakoviće?

172
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,135
Ne, gospodine.

173
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:47,739
Pa, onda ne govori gluposti
o kojima nemaš pojma.

174
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,541
U redu.

175
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,976
Da, gospodine.

176
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,785
Prati me.

177
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,344
Sve u redu, šefe?

178
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:29,114
Ajmo da to riješimo.

179
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:56,241
U redu,
ovo je tvoj vikend za bijeg.

180
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,043
Ja ga zovem "Raj."

181
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,651
Okupite se i slušajte.

182
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,990
Reći ću ovo samo jedanput.

183
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,159
Krevet je za spavanje.

184
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,426
Biljar za igranje.

185
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,262
Televizija za gledanje.

186
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,597
Ima svega 4 kanala,

187
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,933
pet ako se igrate sa antenom.

188
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,968
Raj, malo sutra.

189
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,974
Uuu, udobno je.

190
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:34,979
Ta tvoja lajava usta,
 dovesti će te u neprilike, sine.

191
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,319
Psst,
hej, dođi ovdije.

192
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,958
Stol za jesti.

193
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,993
Da,
nakon temeljitog čišćenja.

194
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,129
Tiho.

195
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,302
Ovo je kuhinja.
Za kuhanje?

196
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:01,239
Reci, kako si smislio
ime Buck Wild? Sviđa mi se.

197
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,874
Ako pogledate iza,

198
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:06,110
primjetiti ćete
roštilj za roštiljanje,

199
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:07,745
sjedalice za sjedenje,

200
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:11,516
I  4-x --

201
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,755
I 4x4.

202
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:20,191
Ima dva rezervara --
Izbrojite ih, jedan, dva --

203
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,528
i čekujem da budu puni 
po vašem odlasku.

204
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,864
Ne želim da itko
hoda gol ovuda, također..

205
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,365
Oh, no, sir.

206
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,668
Uh, ne -- 
Nema toga ovdije..

207
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,447
U redu, slušajte.

208
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,282
Ovo ovdije je "raj".

209
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,317
Ovo cesta kojom smo došli.

210
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,988
Imate
jedan, dva, tri, četiri,

211
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,358
pet mjesta za lov jelena
na Buck Wild ranču.

212
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,894
Možete loviti na bilo kojem.

213
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,963
Ali nemojte...

214
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:06,971
...ponoviti ću, nemojte
prelaziti ovu ogradu

215
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:10,108
Jer je ovo ovdije
mjesto od Billy Ray-a.

216
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,045
A Billy Ray je "jebač".

217
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,853
pa prokletstvo, Candy!

218
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,721
Nismo radili ništa.

219
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,423
Idi u prokleti kamion.

220
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,192
Ne mješaj mi se u život!

221
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:29,694
Sad.
Ufff!

222
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,767
Jel ti se sviđa Candy?

223
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,237
Hm, Candy se čini jako,
hm...

224
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,039
Slatka.

225
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:46,144
Prokleti komičari!

226
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,680
Svi vi.

227
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:51,983
Nepristojni balavci.

228
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:59,424
Prokleti jadni popišanci!

229
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,592
Pokušajte se ne poubijati međusobno.

230
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,965
Uh.

231
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,535
Netko za slatko?

232
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,650
Halo?
Hej, dušo,šta radiš?

233
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:29,120
Skidaj majicu.
Idemo u jacuzzi!
Prestani!

234
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,922
Tko je to? Gdje si?
Mike, mi krećemo!

235
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,657
Samo skini majicu!
Šta?

236
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,093
Ne čujem te.
Na fešti sam.

237
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,496
Dušo, sada je 16:30.

238
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,565
Da,znam to, Craig.

239
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,767
Dobro, pa, hm,
to- to je cool.

240
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,236
Makni se sa telefona!
Imam drugi poziv.

241
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:48,006
Nadam se da se ti i dečki
zabavljate na vašem kampiranju.

242
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,574
Hm, lovu.

243
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,242
Aha. Dobro.

244
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,744
Moram ići.

245
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:55,213
D-dobro. Volim te.
Skidaj se sa telefona, kučko!

246
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,915
Sranje.

247
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,186
Hej,
imaš muinutu?

248
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,855
Naravno prijatelju. Šta je bilo??

249
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,324
Pa, hm...
Vidiš, to...

250
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,797
Lance.

251
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,833
Hej, znaš koji
je tvoj problem?

252
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,802
Brineš se za druge dečke.

253
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:20,938
Ne opterećuj se, prijatelju 
moj mali. Ovo će biti vraški dobar odmor.

254
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,940
Mislim, ne tako dobar
kao što sam ja isplanirao prošle godine

255
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,876
ali na drugom ili trećem mjestu.

256
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,445
Top 5 -- 10.
Hvala.

257
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,783
Vidiš,
t-t-to nije zapravo to...

258
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:33,551
...šta sam htio reći --

259
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,553
Evo i nje!
Sačekaj.

260
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,624
Hej.

261
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:42,727
Oh, ne,
Dobro sam.

262
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,630
Oh, ne,dovesti ćemo te u crkvu
na vrijeme

263
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,932
ne brini.

264
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,361
Zar to nije super?

265
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,930
Tako mirno.

266
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,200
Samo naše društvo,
jedemo meso...

267
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,305
...oštrimo noževe...

268
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:31,609
...okupljamo se oko logorske vatre.

269
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,478
Znate,
znam da neki od vas

270
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,279
bi voljeli da smo
otišli na neko drugo mjesto,

271
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,849
ali, hm...

272
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,984
Osjećaj je dobar kada ste svi
ovdije samnom.

273
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:42,286
Pa, nama je isto drago biti sa tobom
 također, prijatelju.

274
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,755
Iako je vožnja bila malo nezgodna,

275
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,991
ali definitivno
top-10 putovanje.

276
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,327
Imali smo samo
pet ili šest putovanja, Lance.

277
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,761
Začepi, Tom.

278
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,878
Hej, dečki,

279
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,880
Htio bih nešto objaviti.

280
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,284
Lance?
Samo sekunda.

281
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,958
Dobro.

282
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,794
Hm, čuvao sam ovo određeno vrijeme,

283
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:27,265
i, hm, pa,
u ponedjeljak ujutro --

284
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:29,600
[ screaming ]

285
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,271
Oh! Našao si si prijatelja, ha druže?

286
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,872
Koji je to kurac?!

287
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,074
Neznam.Udavio sam ga kod smeća.

288
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:38,643
Makni to od mene,
Lance.

289
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,945
Pa, ovo je --
ovo je nečuveno!

290
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:43,381
Ma daj Tom..
Prestani biti mali peder.

291
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:45,950
Znaš šta? Mislim da ću --
da ću ići u krevet.

292
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,685
Dobro, u redu.
Žao mi je, šefe.

293
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,887
Bila je to samo šala.
Daj, nemoj ići.

294
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,956
Ne, umoran sam od vožnje.

295
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,291
Sjedaj!

296
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,934
Pij!

297
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,276
Žao mi je, šefe.

298
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,045
Nastavi,
o čemu si počeo pričati.

299
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,246
Da.

300
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:16,981
Hm, da, dobro,

301
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:20,685
Hm, prije ovog...
sa mrtvom životinjom, hm,

302
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:22,987
Htio sam vam reći dečki

303
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:25,356
hm, da, pa...

304
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,558
Pitati ću Carlu da se uda za mene.

305
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,695
Žao mi je, Jerry.
Moja greška.

306
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:33,030
Jel to, 
ono šta ja mislim da je?

307
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:36,567
Da, Lance, ja --
ja ću pitati Carlu da se uda za mene.

308
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,903
To je predivno, šefe.

309
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,739
Pa čestitam čovječe.

310
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,041
Vas dvoje ste idealni jedno za drugo --

311
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,676
jednostavno -- idealni.

312
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,478
Hvala, Lance.

313
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,380
Znaš da ćeš mi biti kum, jelda?

314
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,415
Uh-huh.
Naravno partneru, da.

315
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,618
Pa, hm... mmm.

316
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,486
Znaš, mislim da ću u krevet.

317
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:57,121
Da, ne volim baš jutro

318
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:59,156
a znam da ćemo se rano ustati, pa...

319
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:00,691
Zbilja?

320
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,526
Da, pa se vidimo dečki --

321
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:04,562
ujutro.

322
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:08,132
Pa, u redu prijatelju.
Laku noć.

323
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:11,068
Dobro spavaj.

324
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:18,242
Tom, jel Lance dobro?
Da je.

325
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,910
Tom?

326
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:23,080
Gledaj,
neznam je li istina ili ne,

327
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,649
ali me muči 
u posljednje vrijeme,

328
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,651
i mrzim što to kažem
a neznam dali sam u pravu,

329
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,552
ali onda opet
mislim da jesam.

330
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:30,021
ali opet --
Tom.

331
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:35,493
Mislim da Lance
spava sa tvojom curom Carlom.

332
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:37,061
Šta?!
O sranje..

333
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:37,995
Shh!

334
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,597
Šta to pričaš , Tom?

335
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,732
Okej, jel se sjećaš --

336
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:43,701
se sjećaš kada sam došao
prije par mjeseci

337
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:45,603
da donesem one DVD-e --
par njih.

338
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:47,638
I da kažem samo, "Love Actually"
je super film.

339
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,774
Tom!
Oprosti, hm, pa...

340
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:53,744
Ti nisi bio doma ali....
On je bio.

341
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:57,481
Pa šta. Lance stalno dolazi do nas.

342
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,984
Lance i Carla
su dobri prijatelji.

343
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,895
To --
to je predaleko.

344
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:15,032
To bi mogao biti bilo tko.

345
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:17,468
To bi mogao biti bilo tko.

346
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,904
Stvarno, Tom? Ha?
