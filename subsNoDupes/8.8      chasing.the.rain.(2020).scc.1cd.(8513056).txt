00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,496
Last night,
I dreamt of a steady,

4
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:08,401
cool rain falling out
of the African sky,

5
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,701
soaking me to my bones.

6
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,208
I watched as my filth
pooled at my feet,

7
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,180
the raindrops washing
away my stories.

8
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:23,816
That I was free.

9
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:34,193
But then I awoke, choking on
the dust of this dry place.

10
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:38,529
And I wondered if
hope does exist

11
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,198
for people who are desperate

12
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,201
and have nothing
else to cling to.

13
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:46,105
I have to know.

14
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,542
Because if hope is stupid,

15
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,514
why would anything matter?

16
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,689
Balls, it is so
effin' hot out here.

17
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:05,823
Yeah?

18
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,859
Hell of an experience though.

19
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,129
Feels so good to be
making a difference.

20
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:16,703
Oh.

21
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,374
Shit, I had the total runs for
the first two days straight.

22
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:25,244
I seriously thought I was
gonna perish out here.

23
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:27,644
My parents wanted me
to fly back early,

24
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:30,382
but I was like WWJD?

25
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,319
Oh, whoa!

26
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,321
That feels right.

27
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,655
You've been here longer
than I have though.

28
00:02:38,657 --> 00:02:40,393
Bet you can't wait to get home?

29
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,229
Do you have any
Jamba Juice, dude?

30
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,366
Come, come.

31
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,233
Come here.

32
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,901
You need to move it.

33
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:52,570
Twist it tight.

34
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,204
Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.

35
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:57,543
College boy,
we have to work, please.

36
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:05,816
That sign, you can mix it.

37
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,620
All right, all right.

38
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:48,560
That is the fourth
child that she will bury.

39
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:52,596
This droughts,
they devastate us.

40
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:54,698
This one seems
longer than the last.

41
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,703
We pray to God to help but,

42
00:03:59,004 --> 00:03:59,871
He's silent.

43
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:56,495
Sorry.

44
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:00,764
Where the hell is he?

45
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:02,466
Excuse me. Sorry.

46
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,901
Hey, what's up Kelley?

47
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,603
I'm looking for
your idiot roommate.

48
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,003
Why? Did you guys
break up again?

49
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:07,873
No, why?

50
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,384
Are you Stu's roommate?

51
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,461
Yo, broski.

52
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:32,529
Is it the 14th already, man?

53
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:34,531
I was gonna have this place
all spiffed and shined for ya.

54
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:35,401
Come here.

55
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,469
Oh yeah, man.

56
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,471
I am totally getting
the bad ass vibe

57
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,707
off you with the
beard and the tan.

58
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,108
How was Somalia?

59
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,608
Kenya.

60
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,776
Kenya, right.

61
00:05:46,778 --> 00:05:48,646
Hey, you need to come join us.

62
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,550
Lots of inebriated females
making bad decisions.

63
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:53,483
Let's party.

64
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:54,452
Let's party.

65
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,586
I would but-

66
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,124
- All right, see you out there.

67
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,836
Oh, shit.

68
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,704
Look who's here.

69
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,841
Hey, welcome back.

70
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,509
- How are you?
- I can't believe it.

71
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:26,552
How was Africa?

72
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:42,500
I'll talk to you in a minute.

73
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,668
We've got some really
good news today.

74
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:54,512
Working along with
many other organizations

75
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,947
to raise money for relief help,

76
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,949
and to build wells
in communities

77
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,753
with no access to clean water.

78
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,464
No, no, no, no. Just hold.

79
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,865
What are you doing? Stop.

80
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,534
Okay. What, what lens are...

81
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,902
You're using a 50 millimeter.

82
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:20,738
You've got like the
bridge of the Queen Mary,

83
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,606
between you and her.

84
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,041
You know what? We're gonna
Photoshop a little baby there.

85
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:27,010
What an adorable, next
Fredericks of Hollywood.

86
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:28,745
I think that if
I would, maybe..

87
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:30,113
I'll just try a couple.

88
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:31,748
I'll just try a couple on my own

89
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,117
and we'll see how,
if it turns out

90
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,551
and then we can go from there.

91
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,656
No, her neck is fine.

92
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,156
It's gonna look
good in the lens.

93
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:43,726
You're seeing in
3D with two eyes,

94
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:45,031
the lens sees with 1D.

95
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,033
I want you to learn this.

96
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,469
Watch, watch with your
two-dimensional eyes.

97
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:53,603
I see.

98
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:54,605
And learn. Freeze don't...

99
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,173
No, no, no, no, no.

100
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,541
That, if she moves half an inch

101
00:07:58,543 --> 00:08:00,913
is gonna shatter
the beauty of the...

102
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:07,987
It's better.

103
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,861
Seriously, could my
day get any crappier?

104
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,731
Okay, bye.

105
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,733
I loved painting that one.

106
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:57,903
It's beautiful.

107
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,072
What's it about?

108
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,641
That beauty surrounds us.

109
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:07,112
How much is it?

110
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:13,953
You any good?

111
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:16,587
Oh.

112
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,256
Nah.

113
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:20,190
My dad volunteers
teaching an art class

114
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,658
at a homeless shelter.

115
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,728
He's obsessed with photography.

116
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,233
So why was your day so bad?

117
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:31,102
What?

118
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,603
Oh yeah.

119
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:35,672
I have a flat tire and
I don't have a car jack

120
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:37,676
and just some
other stupid stuff.

121
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,846
I don't wanna bore you with my
life's insignificant details.

122
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,214
But it's your life.

123
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:47,084
How could the details
be insignificant?

124
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:53,825
Thanks.

125
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:11,610
I have a car jack you could use.

126
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,648
I can't believe
I don't even have a spare.

127
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,849
I think I have one
in my car that'll fit.

128
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:22,752
No, no, no, I don't
wanna take your tire.

129
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:24,189
It's okay. I'll be right back

130
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,061
You
from around here?

131
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,397
Yep. You?

132
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,331
Yep.

133
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,202
I graduate from the U this
spring with an art degree.

134
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:39,169
Oh.

135
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,972
Everything okay?

136
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,406
Yeah.

137
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:46,276
So what do you wanna
do after you graduate?

138
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,379
I don't know.

139
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,280
Teach, I guess.

140
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,150
You guess?

141
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,419
I wanna teach, just...

142
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,934
- Vanessa.
- It's nothing. I'm sorry.

143
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,435
I had a meeting with
my advisor yesterday.

144
00:11:12,437 --> 00:11:15,204
He completely tore my
senior project to shreds.

145
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:18,342
He said that it
lacked distinction

146
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,681
or originality or whatever.

147
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:24,681
I always wanted
to have, you know,

148
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,949
like an art gallery
or something some day.

149
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,952
Nothing big or fancy, I just...

150
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,754
I feel really stupid right now.

151
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:33,158
I don't know why I'm
telling you this. I'm sorry.

152
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,063
Just paint whatever
pulls you out of bed

153
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,199
in the middle of the night,

154
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:44,302
and people will stand
in line to see that.

155
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,431
And then kind of,.

156
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:16,900
Just wait.

157
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,770
Move over.

158
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,071
Watch this, watch this.

159
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:23,440
Dutch angle candid.

160
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,242
Just slightly over.

161
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,343
Yes.

162
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,945
- Perfect.
- That's good.

163
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,012
- Do you see that?
- That's good.

164
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,448
That's the magic.

165
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:49,199
I just don't know.
They're all so good.

166
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,136
Yes, Steve did a great job.

167
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,936
You're very photogenic.

168
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:56,873
You are so sweet.

169
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,108
And who knew I
could look 25 again?

170
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,878
Hey, Eric.

171
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,016
Some chick holding a tire
is out front asking for you.

172
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,892
So, what do you think?

173
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,526
I'm thinking...

174
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:16,560
I'm thinking you should
get a 24 by 36 of that.

175
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,895
Of this one.

176
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,329
I think we should do 36 wallets.

177
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,565
What do you think
about that one?

178
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,032
Genius.

179
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,437
Hey.

180
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:32,142
I never got your number.
I gave you mine but...

181
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,011
And I couldn't remember
where you worked.

182
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:37,046
So I checked every store
with a photo studio attached

183
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:38,515
like a stalker,

184
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,917
but I promised you that
I'd get your tire back.

185
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:41,586
So here it is.

186
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:48,124
Some of these photos
are really something.

187
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:52,128
Yeah, those were
mostly taken by Steve.

188
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,296
My boss.

189
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:54,998
I love that one.

190
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,868
Oh yeah.

191
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,002
That kid did not wanna be here.

192
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,438
Took about an hour
to calm him down.

193
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,942
You must be very patient.

194
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,447
Hey, I was gonna...

195
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,484
And I was
at a complete loss.

196
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:17,387
Oh, dude. I'm so
glad you're still here.

197
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,988
Stu, what are you doing here?

198
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,456
I dropped by
the old port stude

199
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,092
to see if you wanted
to grab some dinner,

200
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,026
but I overheard
you making plans.

201
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:25,929
And it's a good thing that I
was eavesdropping this time

202
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,129
because I locked myself
out of the apartment again.

203
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:30,066
And you turned off your phone.

204
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:31,468
- Hey.
- Hey

205
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,636
Vanessa. This is my-

206
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,240
- Stuart Halcombe.

207
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,940
I'm Eric's closest confidante.

208
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:39,877
Just don't lock
me out this time.

209
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,277
Absolutely, dude.

210
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,546
- All right. Cool.
- Nice to see you, Stu.

211
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,180
Bye.

212
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:45,348
He's...

213
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,917
What is that?

214
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,320
Hey, Vanessa. How're you doing?

215
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,589
So has Eric been telling
you about all the marathons

216
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:55,224
that he runs to raise money

217
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:56,660
for his charity
work in Ethiopia?

218
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,462
Hey, can we get some
more chips and salsa?

219
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,329
- You've been to Africa?
- Well, yeah.

220
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:02,232
- I mean, a little bit.
- Oh yeah. He's so modest.

221
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,367
You should totally get him
to show you the pictures

222
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:07,070
of him holding the sick babies.

223
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:07,940
It's just...

224
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,915
All right, so you know,
I've gotta go somewhere.

225
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,951
You need that back?

226
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:21,651
Okay, bye.

227
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:23,954
How long have you known him?

228
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,024
I met him two years
ago at a laundromat.

229
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:29,325
Oh my God.

230
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,031
I love the rain.

231
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,232
Well, that's fortunate.

232
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,168
You ready to run?

233
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:38,200
You first.

234
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:39,268
Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go.

235
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:01,123
Take my jacket.

236
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,160
It's wet. It's all wet.

237
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:16,008
Come on.

238
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,110
What are you...

239
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,384
Go in there.

240
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,089
Greetings, my dear child.

241
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:35,461
How long has it been since
your last confession?

242
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:38,663
So tell me about your mother.

243
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:41,198
Why?

244
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,368
I'm just kidding.

245
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:45,167
Oh.

246
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:46,169
Besides I
don't think priests ask

247
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,337
about that anyway.

248
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,440
Right, shrinks do.

249
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,143
Okay.

250
00:16:54,145 --> 00:16:56,381
Let's ask each other deep and
invasive personal questions.

251
00:16:57,482 --> 00:16:59,248
Why would we do that?

252
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,586
Because it's fun.

253
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,222
Tell me your biggest regret.

254
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:09,060
Okay. The biggest regret.

255
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:15,632
Do you routinely corner
people in confessional booths

256
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,601
to ask them personal questions?

257
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,268
No.

258
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,104
But since we are in one,
it seems fitting, right?

259
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:24,609
How about, have you
ever been in love?

260
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,080
No, not in the
way that you mean.

261
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,248
Which way is that?

262
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,116
The real way.

263
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:37,787
Okay, who is the most
influential person in your life?

264
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:39,555
Definitely my parents.

265
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:41,091
It's a tie.

266
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,294
Are you close with yours?

267
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:46,430
I never really knew my dad.

268
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,565
Why not?

269
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,066
He left before I was born.

270
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,367
Isn't that two questions?

271
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:52,303
And your mom?

272
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,110
She's not around anymore.

273
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,478
Did she die?

274
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:03,815
Yeah.

275
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,153
Oh Eric, I'm so sorry.

276
00:18:09,454 --> 00:18:13,155
Holy shit.

277
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:15,659
I thought I was
gonna pee my pants.

278
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,693
How did he not see you?

279
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:19,328
I don't know.

280
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,463
When he started
praying with you,

281
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:22,298
I hightailed it out of there.

282
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,601
And just ran as fast as I can.

283
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,244
Oh, yeah.

284
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,680
Since when do you iron?

285
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:39,382
I got a fellowship
interview today.

286
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,384
So, what's the deal with her?

287
00:18:42,386 --> 00:18:43,385
What?

288
00:18:43,387 --> 00:18:45,287
Oh, come on, man.

289
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:46,722
You've been like a monk
for the last three years.

290
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:48,557
The least you can
do is rollick me

291
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,527
with a few self-indulgent
superficial details.

292
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:52,396
I don't know.

293
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,132
She invited me to her
parents' place Thursday

294
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:55,800
for Thanksgiving.

295
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,503
Let me get this straight.

296
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,238
On your first date,

297
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,206
she wants to spend
like 14 hours with you.

298
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,208
Then she invites you
to her folks' house

299
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,377
for a major holiday?

300
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,312
And all this time,

301
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,180
I thought you needed
remedial help with women.

302
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:12,615
So are you going?

303
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:14,250
Nah, I got too
much stuff to do.

304
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:15,785
Come to Chicago with me.

305
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,720
You know my mom likes
you better anyway.

306
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:19,322
I'll be back by Friday night.

307
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,624
I can't. I gotta work
Friday at 5:00 a.m.

308
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:22,926
Pictures with Santa, remember?

309
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,594
Yay.

310
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:25,564
Have fun with that.

311
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,731
And my goal in
running this marathon

312
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:31,601
is to raise money for
one, maybe even two wells.

313
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,803
Huge tax deduction
for your organization.

314
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,404
Okay, sure. No.

315
00:19:35,406 --> 00:19:36,773
Even a small amount
would be great.

316
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:37,707
Hey, nice job.

317
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,710
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

318
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,712
Hi Vanessa. This is...

319
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,847
I am.

320
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:20,718
Yeah, thanks. It must've
been like a 24-hour thing.

321
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:26,623
I really appreciated dinner.

322
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:30,259
It was really kind of you.

323
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:31,762
So thanks.

324
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,968
Oh

325
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:42,905
Yes.

326
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:43,875
- Okay.
- Awesome.

327
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:46,375
Let's try another one.

328
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:47,443
Brian, look alive.

329
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:48,911
Oh, right.

330
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:50,247
Three, two...

331
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,450
Intelligent, look intelligent.

332
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:55,619
Great.

333
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,420
Brian, tilt and Tricia tilt.

334
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,622
And three, two, One.

335
00:20:58,624 --> 00:20:59,490
Perfect.

336
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:02,324
Try to think of some thoughts.

337
00:21:02,326 --> 00:21:04,663
Just take one more.

338
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,802
Edward Whitney.

339
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,504
What are you doing?

340
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:15,939
You said he's a
philosophy professor

341
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,841
at my place of education.

342
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:18,975
He wrote a book called

343
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:21,344
"Finding Jesus in the Dark Room:

344
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,347
Snapshots of Faith and Doubt".

345
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:26,815
Why would you take a
leak off the Berlin wall?

346
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:29,318
Well, my sergeant and I
actually just wanted pictures

347
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,687
of us standing on the wall.

348
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,389
I still don't know why we peed.

349
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,757
The good news is that our names

350
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,292
weren't on the
ambassador's apology

351
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,660
to the East German people.

352
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,064
So you teach philosophy?

353
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:45,468
Don't miss the donut by
looking through the hole.

354
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,571
A thousand men cannot
undress one naked man.

355
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:49,639
Sorry.

356
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,543
Yes, I teach philosophy.

357
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:55,378
Vanessa says that you
are a photographer?

358
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,813
Yes, sir.

359
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,914
Just most family
portraits, mostly.

360
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,784
Just?

361
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,852
My family portraits are the
most mysterious and fascinating.

362
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,721
Just think if those
photos could speak up.

363
00:22:05,723 --> 00:22:06,724
Yeah, that's true.

364
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:08,994
Are you Lutheran?

365
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:11,661
Lutheran...

366
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,698
Were you at least
baptized as an infant,

367
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,333
or were you dipped?

368
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,834
Mama, could you come
with me in the kitchen?

369
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:22,338
I was just getting to know
Vanessa's new little friend.

370
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,341
My grandma has been
trying to set me up

371
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,976
with her church organist
for like three years.

372
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,611
And?

373
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,846
Well, he's 40
and really creepy.

374
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:33,382
Hey, but at least
he's a Lutheran.

375
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:34,385
Yeah, that's true.

376
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,357
Whatever.

377
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,759
That is JP, my
parents' foster kid,

378
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:45,496
and he is such a jerk.

379
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,797
Says a lot about your parents.

380
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,668
Yeah. Well my dad, his
mom died when he was 15.

381
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,772
He was basically
alone from then on.

382
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,641
You're putting too
much on the plate.

383
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,709
You're doing a great job.

384
00:23:00,711 --> 00:23:02,010
- They'll fall off.
- Mama, come on.

385
00:23:02,012 --> 00:23:06,048
- Come on, mama.
- Oh, grandma, grandma.

386
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,851
Put this right there.

387
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,486
You do such a good
job with that.

388
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,388
Eric, darling, can you
take the punch bowl

389
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,855
and put it on the table and
then come back in and finish?

390
00:23:12,857 --> 00:23:14,524
You're doing a great job.

391
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,426
Mom, oh my God.
These are so cute.

392
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:17,559
You made every single one

393
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:18,663
and you made the walnut ones?

394
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,067
- I'm so sorry.
- There you go.

395
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,469
You know what? I
think you missed a spot.

396
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,970
Shut up.

397
00:23:27,972 --> 00:23:29,538
Here, I grabbed one
of my dad's shirts.

398
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,873
You wanna give me
yours and I'll wash it?

399
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,741
No, thanks. It'll dry.

400
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:34,677
You're covered in punch
and it's gonna stain.

401
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,078
It's just an old shirt.

402
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,713
Eric, just change
your damn shirt.

403
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:39,850
I don't need to,
so just drop it.

404
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,126
Quieter out here, isn't it?

405
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:53,062
Oh, I'm sorry.

406
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,197
I didn't mean to scare you.

407
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,132
No, I just got this new camera

408
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,470
and I was experimenting
with the low light.

409
00:23:59,904 --> 00:24:00,771
Nice.

410
00:24:01,772 --> 00:24:03,172
Hey, come here.

411
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:05,107
Let me show you something.

412
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:10,115
Come on.

413
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,590
Voila!

414
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,191
Wow. This is great.

415
00:24:22,193 --> 00:24:24,494
Ed, I
need you for a sec.

416
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,929
Oh yeah, Bonnie. Be right up.

417
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,030
Here, make yourself at home.

418
00:24:28,032 --> 00:24:28,899
Okay.

419
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:43,979
Where's Ed?

420
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:46,149
I think he'll be
back in a minute.

421
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,519
I'm Eric, Vanessa's friend.

422
00:24:57,828 --> 00:24:58,696
No.

423
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:01,965
So, are you into art too?

424
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,566
I think it's
exceedingly lame actually.

425
00:25:04,568 --> 00:25:06,070
Except for photography, right?

426
00:25:08,205 --> 00:25:10,773
Here, let me show you
something pretty cool.

427
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,711
This was a couple of weeks ago.

428
00:25:17,214 --> 00:25:18,082
JP.

429
00:25:19,884 --> 00:25:22,151
What have I told you
about smoking in here?

430
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,688
We'll talk about this later.

431
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,792
Sorry about that.

432
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:31,661
JP's been a tough nut to crack,

433
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,530
and today he disrespected
Bonnie and I snapped.

434
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:36,533
I said some things to him I
probably shouldn't have said

435
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,768
knowing his history,
and tried to apologize,

436
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,938
but I don't really
think it was enough.

437
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,940
Oh, it's enough.

438
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,174
He's probably more
impressed with you now.

439
00:25:46,176 --> 00:25:47,776
Why is that?

440
00:25:47,778 --> 00:25:50,013
Because you made a
mistake and apologized.

441
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,680
Sometimes that's even better

442
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:53,183
than never making
a mistake at all.

443
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:02,824
Got my first camera when
I was stationed in Korea.

444
00:26:02,826 --> 00:26:04,095
I just couldn't put it down.

445
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:06,996
These are great.

446
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,631
I do love art because I think

447
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,333
it's one of the
few things in life

448
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,201
that you really don't have
to understand to create.

449
00:26:13,203 --> 00:26:15,337
I mean, you can
have contradictions

450
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:17,741
and doubts, insecurities.

451
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,177
Vanna showed me some
of your photographs.

452
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,245
They're exquisite.

453
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,215
You have quite a talent.

454
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,815
Thanks.

455
00:26:26,817 --> 00:26:28,817
Stu says you're
saving for college.

456
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:31,254
You know, the US National Press

457
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,692
has a scholarship
contest for photography.

458
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:38,797
You should really consider
entering one of your photos.

459
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,931
No, I'm serious.

460
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:43,801
You should.

461
00:27:31,415 --> 00:27:33,315
I see the sun
struggling for attention

462
00:27:33,317 --> 00:27:34,985
through the trembling branches.

463
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,856
And the cold wind whispers
our approaching fate.

464
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,424
I've pushed the
envelope of propriety

465
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:44,895
standing so close to her canvas.

466
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:48,930
I'm captivated by
her colorful layers,

467
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:52,701
her deep strokes are miniature
mountains reaching out to me,

468
00:27:52,703 --> 00:27:55,373
making valleys shadow
in the cool lights.

469
00:27:58,308 --> 00:28:01,411
But I'm a shadow too,
sewn to her feet,

470
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,114
with her as she walks.

471
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,784
And she talks to
me as if I'm real.

472
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,419
Are you warm enough?

473
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,452
- Yes.
- You're sure.

474
00:28:10,454 --> 00:28:11,787
Yes.

475
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:13,221
But it's really cold up here.

476
00:28:13,223 --> 00:28:14,425
I just don't want
you to get sick.

477
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,197
But my awkwardness protects me.

478
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:27,003
And like her shadow,

479
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:30,141
I fade and wish the
sun would never set.

480
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,280
But if I confessed,

481
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:40,951
there'd be no reason
to wait for a reply,

482
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,123
knowing full well
this thing will die.

483
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,472
Hey dude.

484
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:04,341
- Hey.
- Hey.

485
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,176
I'm done.

486
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,844
You've written four sentences.

487
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:10,113
That was hard.

488
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:10,981
I need candy.

489
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,486
Hey, you know, most guys

490
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,353
that are trying to
avoid a relationship

491
00:29:18,355 --> 00:29:19,354
just ignore the chick.

492
00:29:19,356 --> 00:29:21,324
You know, stop calling.

493
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,325
They don't run off to
a third world country.

494
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:25,327
It is a bit drastic.

495
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:26,929
It's not what I'm doing.

496
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,930
And you need to stop
reading my mail.

497
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,231
I thought it was mine.

498
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:31,033
From Africa Water Venture?

499
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,068
I care about
Africa too, you know?

500
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,237
Shut up.

501
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,105
What?

502
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:38,910
So you leaving again?

503
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:58,496
You okay?

504
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:15,246
Do you actually
think these look good?

505
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,915
What is the matter with you?

506
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:23,385
I took a chance on you when
you didn't even have an address

507
00:30:23,387 --> 00:30:26,189
or a phone number to
put on an application.

508
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,959
And I have been good to you.

509
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:32,995
I gave you some amazingly
fashionable work clothes.

510
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,565
I gave you 32 bucks
of my own money

511
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,301
to sponsor you in that marathon

512
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,536
for your little Africa thing.

513
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:41,405
And why?

514
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,076
Why Eric?

515
00:30:46,944 --> 00:30:47,611
Don't speak.

516
00:30:49,446 --> 00:30:52,480
Because you were one of the
best damned photographers

517
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:54,517
I had ever seen.

518
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,151
But lately, you are late.

519
00:30:56,153 --> 00:30:58,854
Your work has been
subpar at best.

520
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:00,021
I mean, where is the art?

521
00:31:00,023 --> 00:31:01,324
Where is the craft?

522
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,892
Steve, are you serious?

523
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,594
You take pictures in a mall.

524
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,362
Of people sitting in
front of fake backdrops

525
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,029
like the grand Canyon,

526
00:31:08,031 --> 00:31:10,632
that we then Photoshop
the hell out of.

527
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:13,436
What did you say?

528
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,305
I'm sorry.

529
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,274
I'll redo the session
on my own time.

530
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,143
I'm sorry.

531
00:31:26,183 --> 00:31:27,050
I'm sorry, kid.

532
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,385
You're fired.

533
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:32,020
What?

534
00:31:32,022 --> 00:31:32,889
Yeah.

535
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,259
F-R-I-E-D.

536
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,151
There's a problem
with the well we built.

537
00:32:03,153 --> 00:32:05,153
It's contaminated.

538
00:32:05,155 --> 00:32:07,055
They had to shut it down.

539
00:32:07,057 --> 00:32:08,457
What?

540
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,359
They can't do
that. They need it.

541
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,361
It's contaminated by
some form of arsenic.

542
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,162
That's impossible.
We tested it.

543
00:32:14,164 --> 00:32:16,632
Yeah, but Eric, contaminants
can migrate for miles.

544
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,967
We need to fix it.

545
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,604
There's no money to fix it.

546
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,472
Donations are down.

547
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:25,975
I can hardly even pay the
lease to keep our door open.

548
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:28,046
We can't just sit
here and do nothing.

549
00:32:31,982 --> 00:32:35,217
They're depriving communities
of clean water because donors,

550
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:37,219
governments and
nongovernmental organizations

551
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,087
have built infrastructure

552
00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:40,724
and then just ignored the
need to maintain them.

553
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,997
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

554
00:32:48,665 --> 00:32:50,134
Okay. All right.

555
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,971
Yeah, thank you.

556
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,173
I'm sorry.

557
00:33:12,222 --> 00:33:13,090
Eric.

558
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,193
Eric.

559
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,228
Hey, buddy.

560
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,398
I'm back from Chicago.

561
00:33:24,134 --> 00:33:25,236
How'd the marathon go?

562
00:33:26,503 --> 00:33:29,171
Dude, you look like hell.

563
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,375
- Are you sick?
- What?

564
00:33:34,378 --> 00:33:37,313
Hey, aren't you
going with Vanessa

565
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,583
to an art party tonight?

566
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,584
And you are a little musty.

567
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,520
You might wanna shower it up.

568
00:34:02,773 --> 00:34:04,574
You look beautiful.

569
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:07,709
Where have you been?

570
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:09,711
I'm sorry I'm late.

571
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:11,713
I've been calling
you for days.

572
00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:13,682
I misplaced my phone.

573
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,383
And I came by, are you okay?

574
00:34:15,385 --> 00:34:17,385
- You don't look good.
- I'm fine.

575
00:34:17,387 --> 00:34:19,389
Sorry I didn't call you.

576
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,496
I'll be right back.

577
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:58,623
Hey...

578
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:06,597
What are you doing?

579
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,865
You smoke?

580
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:11,735
No.

581
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:13,735
Then why are you smoking?

582
00:36:13,737 --> 00:36:14,869
I don't smoke.

583
00:36:14,871 --> 00:36:16,572
It was just one cigarette.

584
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,309
Okay Eric, what's going on?

585
00:36:21,244 --> 00:36:22,744
I'm leaving.

586
00:36:22,746 --> 00:36:24,579
Okay. Well, wait
I'll go with you.

587
00:36:24,581 --> 00:36:25,449
No, Vanessa.

588
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:30,318
I'm going back to
Kenya, I leave Monday.

589
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,188
What?

590
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:33,356
When will you be back?

591
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:36,726
I'm not coming back.

592
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,394
You're kidding, right?

593
00:36:39,396 --> 00:36:41,329
I always said
I was going back.

594
00:36:41,331 --> 00:36:42,597
Yeah, for like a little
mission trip or something.

595
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,233
Not to go there indefinitely.

596
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,702
And what, you're
going in two days?

597
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,639
- Where's the fire?
- It hasn't rained.

598
00:36:49,706 --> 00:36:51,340
There's no water.

599
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,275
The villages are waste
and full of disease-

600
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:54,709
- So I'm a horrible person
for not wanting you to go?

601
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:56,746
'cause I thought
that you and I...

602
00:36:59,282 --> 00:37:00,749
So what? This it, huh?

603
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,351
I'm just gonna get like
a Christmas form letter

604
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,251
from you once a
year, and that's it?

605
00:37:03,253 --> 00:37:04,286
Vanessa...

606
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,954
No.

607
00:37:05,956 --> 00:37:07,590
Have I been huffing spray
paint this entire time

608
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:08,757
or have you almost
been pretending

609
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,358
like there's not something

610
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,830
not going on between
us, on purpose?

611
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:22,271
Just because I'm leaving
doesn't mean that I don't...

612
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,271
This isn't easy.

613
00:37:23,273 --> 00:37:24,706
What it isn't easy?

614
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:25,609
Tell me the truth.

615
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,553
It never would've
worked between us.

616
00:38:33,443 --> 00:38:35,846
What if we're longing
for day to break

617
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:40,617
but night has already
strangled the dawn in her bed?

618
00:38:43,086 --> 00:38:46,389
What if hope is just a
tale we tell ourselves

619
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:49,626
and there's nothing
else to hold on to?

620
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,765
I came to this place
to feel normal,

621
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:59,637
but someone is still
pressing me down on my back.

622
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,442
My mind is throbbing,

623
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:07,110
my hands weakening,

624
00:39:09,512 --> 00:39:11,614
and my pictures
are slipping away.

625
00:39:42,545 --> 00:39:44,445
Hey, Eric.

626
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:47,148
You know I'm surprised to
see you sleeping on the job.

627
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,818
Eric, are you okay?

628
00:39:49,753 --> 00:39:51,820
Eric, are you okay?

629
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:52,688
Come, can you get up?

630
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:53,824
Yeah.

631
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:58,092
Okay, just lie back.

632
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:00,829
I can't
move. I can't move.

633
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,463
Okay Eric, don't worry.

634
00:40:02,465 --> 00:40:03,898
We're going to get
you to a doctor.

635
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,833
It's okay. We're going
to get you to a doctor.

636
00:40:17,947 --> 00:40:19,182
How are you feeling?

637
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:21,552
Better.

638
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,653
Thank you.

639
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,992
Eric, arrangements
have been made for you

640
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,661
to be sent home.

641
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:33,664
No, no, no.

642
00:40:34,898 --> 00:40:35,833
I'll be fine here.

643
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,635
Look, I will be very
sorry to see you go,

644
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:42,003
but our doctor is very concerned

645
00:40:42,005 --> 00:40:43,871
at how weak you still are.

646
00:40:43,873 --> 00:40:46,175
American hospitals can help
you much more than we can here.

647
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:47,675
No, no, Matua.

648
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:48,545
Please.

649
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:51,114
I need to stay.

650
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:58,622
I'm begging you.

651
00:41:14,103 --> 00:41:16,804
You clicked like,
and then all of a sudden,

652
00:41:16,806 --> 00:41:18,740
you was talking about
some matters of the heart

653
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,175
on his status.

654
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:21,876
What, you aren't fucking
lying to me right now.

655
00:41:21,878 --> 00:41:23,144
No, this bitch.

656
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:25,682
She's got too much respect...

657
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,034
I don't understand.

658
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:49,003
Basically, your
immune system thinks

659
00:41:49,005 --> 00:41:52,076
your spinal cord has an
infection, even though it doesn't.

660
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,177
So it's making antibodies

661
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,112
that are attacking the myelin
cells of your optic nerve

662
00:41:58,114 --> 00:42:00,016
and your healthy spinal cord.

663
00:42:01,985 --> 00:42:05,052
Eric, we don't know
exactly what causes this

664
00:42:05,054 --> 00:42:06,623
and it's very rare,

665
00:42:08,224 --> 00:42:10,760
but there's nothing you
could've done to prevent it.

666
00:42:15,164 --> 00:42:16,699
What's gonna happen to me?

667
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,717
A household water heater

668
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,818
can boil hundreds of gallons
of water a day, right?

669
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,854
But this wouldn't be an
ordinary gravity filter.

670
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:13,991
I mean, this would...

671
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,624
Hello.

672
00:43:16,626 --> 00:43:18,025
I'm sorry.

673
00:43:18,027 --> 00:43:19,760
This wouldn't be an
ordinary gravity filter.

674
00:43:19,762 --> 00:43:21,195
You could use the pumps

675
00:43:21,197 --> 00:43:22,966
to force the water
through the filter.

676
00:43:24,934 --> 00:43:28,202
I know, but I'm
not a scientist...

677
00:43:28,204 --> 00:43:29,873
Okay, I understand.

678
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:22,858
Oh God.

679
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,092
Oh God, help me.

680
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:25,362
Oh God, help me.

681
00:44:50,086 --> 00:44:51,853
This episode
was much more severe

682
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,454
than the mild ones he's had

683
00:44:53,456 --> 00:44:56,958
and caused irreversible
inflammation of his spinal cord.

684
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,793
Optica is progressing...

685
00:44:58,795 --> 00:45:00,996
He has some left arm paralysis
and right leg weakness.

686
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,298
Optic nerve damage causing
significantly blurred division.

687
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,766
Of a chronic pain and
become more disabled

688
00:45:05,768 --> 00:45:07,202
throughout his life.

689
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,105
I'm so sorry.

690
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:26,023
Hey.

691
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:28,391
How you doing?

692
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:34,095
The doctor said that
you've responded great

693
00:45:34,097 --> 00:45:35,030
to the medication.

694
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:39,001
So that's great.

695
00:45:42,972 --> 00:45:46,210
I made some new
playlists for you.

696
00:45:47,777 --> 00:45:51,179
I'll just put 'em
on your table there.

697
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,882
You know, you don't
need to feel weird

698
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,383
or anything around me.

699
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:58,820
Not that you would or
should for that matter.

700
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:01,856
Besides, my mom already
bought you all this new crap

701
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:03,358
from Ikea that she
made me put together.

702
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,096
So you can't really
decide to move now.

703
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,768
All right.

704
00:46:12,135 --> 00:46:15,170
Well, hey, I gotta
get going to class,

705
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:18,442
but I'll stop by afterwards.

706
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:20,344
Okay?

707
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:23,144
Okay.

708
00:46:23,146 --> 00:46:26,884
Well, yeah, I'll see you later.

709
00:46:43,065 --> 00:46:44,065
Be careful.

710
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,016
Okay.

711
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,821
That's cool.

712
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,363
I got you.

713
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,130
Easy.

714
00:47:16,132 --> 00:47:17,201
Easy does it.

715
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:57,173
Any change?

716
00:48:02,211 --> 00:48:03,644
I've been concerned

717
00:48:03,646 --> 00:48:05,012
because you skipped
several appointments.

718
00:48:05,014 --> 00:48:05,949
I'm sorry.

719
00:48:07,617 --> 00:48:09,251
I've just been really busy
with the holidays and all.

720
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:10,918
I see.

721
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,487
And how have you been adjusting?

722
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:13,523
Just peachy.

723
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:18,994
Eric, I would encourage
you to utilize the services

724
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:20,631
that are available
to assist you.

725
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:28,302
Now, it's a little trickier
with the blurry vision

726
00:48:28,304 --> 00:48:32,643
and the leg weakness
and the arm immobility.

727
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,177
Thank you for that
comprehensive recap.

728
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:37,345
Sure thing.

729
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:38,348
Here you go.

730
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:47,554
Okay. That's where we are today.

731
00:48:47,556 --> 00:48:51,492
Now, it's very important
for you to learn

732
00:48:51,494 --> 00:48:53,994
to do things for yourself,

733
00:48:53,996 --> 00:48:57,164
so you don't have to depend
on other people all the time.

734
00:48:57,166 --> 00:48:58,199
Wow.

735
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,101
That was beautiful.

736
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,539
I think I'll needlepoint that
and put it above the mantle.

737
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:09,045
Shit.

738
00:49:10,313 --> 00:49:11,248
I'm reaching him.

739
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:29,229
I truly believe that
I have the favor of God.

740
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:34,101
And the good news is that
the Lord wants all of us

741
00:49:34,103 --> 00:49:36,739
to have thriving
and abundant lives.

742
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:43,046
He wants everyone of us to
be healthy and successful.

743
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:48,652
I have a vibrant life filled
with blessing I don't deserve.

744
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,019
Blessing after blessing after
blessing after blessing...

745
00:49:52,021 --> 00:49:52,688
Hey.

746
00:49:54,557 --> 00:49:56,257
It sounds like God
is your trophy wife.

747
00:49:57,693 --> 00:49:58,561
Eric.

748
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:04,365
Been a while since you stopped
by here to argue with me.

749
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:06,266
Everything all right?

750
00:50:06,268 --> 00:50:07,769
Oh, you know, other than
having a fucked spinal cord,

751
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:09,506
just living the dream.

752
00:50:10,606 --> 00:50:12,139
Spinal cord?

753
00:50:12,141 --> 00:50:13,009
I'm sorry.

754
00:50:15,478 --> 00:50:16,346
That's it?

755
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:21,016
And if you need
His healing powers,

756
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,017
just call on Him
and He'll be there.

757
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,523
Amen and hallelujah.

758
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:31,527
Oh my God.

759
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:33,730
It's a miracle.

760
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:37,200
Are you serious?

761
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:44,041
How's it feel to get out?

762
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,278
Well, feels good to me.

763
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:53,380
Oh, hey.

764
00:50:53,382 --> 00:50:54,349
Do you mind if I say hi to
a buddy of mine from school?

765
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:55,215
Go.

766
00:50:55,217 --> 00:50:56,383
Cool.

767
00:50:56,385 --> 00:50:57,385
What's up?

768
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,519
Hey, Stu. How are you?

769
00:50:58,521 --> 00:50:59,521
How are you doin', man.

770
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:00,356
Good to see you, buddy.

771
00:51:05,327 --> 00:51:06,262
How was Africa?

772
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:13,135
I love your tan.

773
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,840
Oh my God.

774
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:19,709
Vanessa.

775
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,209
Hey.

776
00:51:22,211 --> 00:51:24,545
How the hell are you?

777
00:51:24,547 --> 00:51:26,113
You know what?

778
00:51:26,115 --> 00:51:27,414
I would totally
invite you to join us,

779
00:51:27,416 --> 00:51:29,717
but we were just about to leave.

780
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:31,788
No, I'm not
staying. I'm just...

781
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,090
My roommate thought
she saw you here

782
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:37,624
and I didn't believe her.

783
00:51:37,626 --> 00:51:39,661
What's happened to
you? You look awful.

784
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:40,530
Thanks.

785
00:51:41,797 --> 00:51:43,130
I'm fine.

786
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:44,132
How long have you been back?

787
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:44,701
It didn't work out?

788
00:51:46,802 --> 00:51:49,336
Did you get my drawing?

789
00:51:49,338 --> 00:51:50,838
Oh, you know
what? That's my bad.

790
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,173
Dude, I'm sorry.

791
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:53,173
I totally forgot to give it...

792
00:51:53,175 --> 00:51:54,374
You gave it to me.

793
00:51:54,376 --> 00:51:56,110
No, I'm pretty
sure I forgot...

794
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:57,547
No, you didn't forget.

795
00:51:58,681 --> 00:51:59,548
It was great.

796
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:02,249
Yeah, well you
said you never had

797
00:52:02,251 --> 00:52:03,353
your portrait made before, so...

798
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:07,690
Congratulations on
winning that scholarship.

799
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:12,260
Your story and your
picture were really moving.

800
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:14,896
Can you believe they called
him an idealist though?

801
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:16,764
- This guy?
- My dad said

802
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:18,635
it might open up some new
doors for you for photography.

803
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,505
I'm doing some
new things instead.

804
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:23,773
Yeah, I can see that.

805
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:28,711
Basically you quit everything
when you get tired of it.

806
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:32,815
Well,

807
00:52:35,784 --> 00:52:37,851
I never lied to you, Eric.

808
00:52:37,853 --> 00:52:40,256
And I really hope I
never see you again.

809
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,499
I'm sorry, man.

810
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,369
Are you okay?

811
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:57,740
You told me she drew a circus.

812
00:53:00,409 --> 00:53:01,543
I'm sorry.

813
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:02,646
I thought it would upset you.

814
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:26,266
What the hell
did you do in here?

815
00:53:26,268 --> 00:53:27,969
She never wants
to see me again.

816
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:31,305
And you, you wouldn't
want to either

817
00:53:31,307 --> 00:53:32,673
if you knew who I really am.

818
00:53:32,675 --> 00:53:34,275
All right, you're
talking smack.

819
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:35,943
Shut up. I can't
even see shit.

820
00:53:35,945 --> 00:53:37,413
Hey, hey, hey.

821
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:43,253
Do you know there are
millions of people

822
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:49,226
who are at risk of death
because of drought?

823
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:53,494
Good segue, buddy.

824
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:55,599
But yeah, I think I heard
something about that.

825
00:53:57,266 --> 00:53:59,266
See, here's the thing.

826
00:53:59,268 --> 00:54:03,637
If I was God and I was gonna
drop a drought on some folks

827
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:08,612
for the hell of it, I
personally would at least try

828
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,845
to drop it on people
that could handle it.

829
00:54:11,847 --> 00:54:16,583
Not people that are
hardly surviving as it is.

830
00:54:16,585 --> 00:54:18,487
No, drunk man.

831
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:21,021
Area's just prone
to more droughts.

832
00:54:21,023 --> 00:54:23,559
There's no cosmic conspiracy.

833
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:28,262
And seriously, why do you
keep trying to believe

834
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:31,634
in some supposedly omnipotent
being you don't even like?

835
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:37,507
I was just trying
to be a good person.

836
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,927
You're saying you want me
to record a message for Eric?

837
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:02,429
Yeah, it's this new
thing that Eric's doing.

838
00:55:02,431 --> 00:55:03,930
He thinks that recorded messages

839
00:55:03,932 --> 00:55:05,867
are more personal
than written ones.

840
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:06,800
Stu, what's going on?

841
00:55:06,802 --> 00:55:08,735
Nothing.

842
00:55:08,737 --> 00:55:10,606
Look, you said you didn't
ever wanna see him again.

843
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,307
He looked terrible when I saw-

844
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,508
- You know, well, time's
kinder to some of us.

845
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:15,642
So I'll have him
give you a call.

846
00:55:15,644 --> 00:55:16,911
Stu.

847
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:17,912
Yeah.

848
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:19,646
Don't you have class?

849
00:55:19,648 --> 00:55:20,516
You know what?

850
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:22,751
Seriously, what are the odds?

851
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:25,619
You know...

852
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:27,021
What are you doing?

853
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:27,891
Nothing.

854
00:55:29,925 --> 00:55:31,559
Please stop leaving
your crap on the floor?

855
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:32,793
Yeah, you're right.

856
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:33,663
I'm sorry.

857
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:37,030
And even if
you're on a diet,

858
00:55:37,032 --> 00:55:39,700
look at just some of the
great foods you can prepare

859
00:55:39,702 --> 00:55:42,003
in your new Showtime rotisserie.

860
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,403
Hey, man.

861
00:55:43,405 --> 00:55:45,106
Hey.

862
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:46,474
Anything good on?

863
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:48,376
No.

864
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:50,912
An eight-pound
mouthwatering pork loin roast-

865
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:54,048
- So there's this thing
I need to tell you,

866
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,450
but I'm not really
sure how to say it.

867
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:57,851
You could just say it.

868
00:55:57,853 --> 00:55:59,686
Okay, brilliant.

869
00:55:59,688 --> 00:56:01,857
Just promise me you're not
gonna try to kill the messenger.

870
00:56:08,864 --> 00:56:10,399
Broski, you okay?

871
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:15,670
She freaked, man.

872
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,104
I didn't know what to do.

873
00:56:17,106 --> 00:56:18,438
You should have
told me right away.

874
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,907
I tried, but she took off

875
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:21,541
and I had to make
sure she was okay.

876
00:56:21,543 --> 00:56:23,411
What happened? Is she okay?

877
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:26,012
I chased her down the street
and we went out to coffee.

878
00:56:26,014 --> 00:56:27,749
She was a total mess.

879
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:29,717
I missed my class
because she was sobbing

880
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,153
- for like two hours.
- I don't wanna hear this.

881
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:34,054
No, no, no. It's a good thing.

882
00:56:34,056 --> 00:56:35,655
I think I helped her like
process it a little bit.

883
00:56:35,657 --> 00:56:38,793
I gave her like the
basic Wikipedia version,

884
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:41,729
with maybe just a
little added commentary.

885
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,664
You promised me you would
never talk to her about this.

886
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,032
Dude, I promised that
like six months ago.

887
00:56:46,034 --> 00:56:47,635
Besides, I kind of
figured the jig was up

888
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:48,936
when she was standing
at our front door

889
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:50,539
and you didn't even notice.

890
00:56:51,907 --> 00:56:53,508
Shit man, I'm sorry.

891
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:54,778
She wants you to call her.

892
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,845
This does not go here.

893
00:56:58,847 --> 00:57:00,483
I had to change a light bulb.

894
00:57:13,195 --> 00:57:14,795
Whoopsie.

895
00:57:14,797 --> 00:57:15,731
I got it. I got it.

896
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,666
I got a surprise for you before
I head off to the airport

897
00:57:19,668 --> 00:57:22,570
that might cheer
you up a little bit.

898
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:26,675
So, I want to do our Christmas
gift exchange a little early.

899
00:57:27,876 --> 00:57:29,142
You're kidding, right?

900
00:57:29,144 --> 00:57:30,478
No, come on.

901
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,447
I know that you're still pissed

902
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,684
about the whole
Vanessa thing, but...

903
00:57:36,985 --> 00:57:37,985
What is that?

904
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:39,122
It's a dog, homie.

905
00:57:41,056 --> 00:57:42,657
Chill out.

906
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:44,592
That's not a dog.
It's a fricking hamster.

907
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:45,927
No, it's a teacup poodle.

908
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,461
Merry Christmas.

909
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:48,896
Do you wanna hold him?

910
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:50,764
Why the hell would
you give me a poodle?

911
00:57:50,766 --> 00:57:52,233
What do you mean? They're
like the smartest breed.

912
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,633
Check it out. I already
taught them how to sit.

913
00:57:53,635 --> 00:57:54,635
Sit.

914
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:55,670
Sit.

915
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,472
Oh, look at that, huh?

916
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,905
And his uncle's cousin's brother

917
00:57:58,907 --> 00:58:00,041
was like a poodle
state champion.

918
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:01,943
I can't believe you did this.

919
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:02,943
Don't worry about the
apartment's no dog policy.

920
00:58:02,945 --> 00:58:04,845
I talked to the manager.

921
00:58:04,847 --> 00:58:05,713
I told him you needed him
and he said it was okay.

922
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:08,117
So I got you

923
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:11,985
a bed and some food,

924
00:58:11,987 --> 00:58:12,855
and a bowl.

925
00:58:14,523 --> 00:58:15,557
I don't want a dog.

926
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,527
Take him back.

927
00:58:24,967 --> 00:58:26,969
You made him feel bad.

928
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:31,037
Hey man, it's cool.

929
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,840
I never asked if you
were a dog person.

930
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,010
I just thought that...

931
00:58:36,278 --> 00:58:38,679
Well, I'm sure I can find
a nice geriatric couple

932
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,113
that'll take him or...

933
00:58:40,115 --> 00:58:42,016
I appreciate you
thinking of me.

934
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:45,019
You know I'm only gonna
be in Aspen for a few days.

935
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,987
My parents still
want you to come.

936
00:58:46,989 --> 00:58:48,523
That's nice.

937
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,559
Thank them for me.

938
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:54,831
You know, between my
classes and my internship,

939
00:58:56,632 --> 00:58:58,967
I'm not really gonna be around
a whole lot next semester.

940
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,871
I should get going
to the airport.

941
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,641
So what do you want me
to do with tiny Tim here?

942
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:09,644
I mean, I'll take him
as soon as I get back.

943
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:10,313
Fine.

944
00:59:11,914 --> 00:59:12,782
Okay.

945
00:59:14,182 --> 00:59:15,184
What's that smell?

946
00:59:17,286 --> 00:59:18,920
He took a dump in
my bed, didn't he?

947
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:20,657
It's a good
thing he's small.

948
00:59:58,795 --> 00:59:59,662
Jeffrey.

949
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,767
I can't believe it.

950
01:00:06,735 --> 01:00:10,271
I know I shouldn't be surprised
you're all grown up but...

951
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,938
How'd you find me?

952
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,143
The lady at the
library helped me.

953
01:00:15,978 --> 01:00:17,378
It was a little bit tricky
using your middle name,

954
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,648
but I'd recognize these
baby blues anywhere.

955
01:00:20,983 --> 01:00:23,016
And aren't you the
good little Samaritan?

956
01:00:23,018 --> 01:00:24,686
And winning 10 grand to boot.

957
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:27,220
It's just a scholarship.

958
01:00:27,222 --> 01:00:28,991
Who knew I'd raise
such a smarty pants.

959
01:00:32,094 --> 01:00:33,661
It's freezing out here.

960
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,896
Are you gonna invite
me in or what?

961
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:37,130
Fuck.

962
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:42,905
Oh, look at the puppy.

963
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,141
He's so cute.

964
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:05,928
I don't...

965
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:09,898
I never heard of that before.

966
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:13,767
You're not...

967
01:01:13,769 --> 01:01:14,434
It's not...

968
01:01:14,436 --> 01:01:15,304
Fatal?

969
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,208
No, unfortunately not.

970
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:27,882
Well, no big deal. Shit happens.

971
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:29,018
Yeah, it does.

972
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:47,170
Here, let me.

973
01:02:02,117 --> 01:02:03,786
Nice place you got here.

974
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:06,422
Live alone?

975
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,092
No.

976
01:02:11,193 --> 01:02:12,929
You get a girlfriend?

977
01:02:13,862 --> 01:02:14,730
No.

978
01:02:19,835 --> 01:02:20,836
You get by okay?

979
01:02:22,304 --> 01:02:23,172
Yup.

980
01:02:28,143 --> 01:02:29,244
So are you clean?

981
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:35,751
Yeah.

982
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:37,420
A long time now.

983
01:02:42,891 --> 01:02:45,327
Well, I'm surprised
to see you here.

984
01:02:47,195 --> 01:02:48,297
Surprised?

985
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:52,802
That a mother would wanna see
her only child after 10 years?

986
01:02:54,836 --> 01:02:55,505
It's 12.

987
01:02:57,072 --> 01:02:59,940
It's the day after my
13th birthday, remember?

988
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,142
You got me a lottery ticket.

989
01:03:02,144 --> 01:03:03,278
Of course I remember.

990
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,150
You just took off and I didn't
even know if you were alive.

991
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:13,222
Anyway,

992
01:03:15,257 --> 01:03:16,458
I have to be somewhere.

993
01:03:20,061 --> 01:03:23,132
I'll come by again and
lend a hand or something.

994
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,474
I remember being so sure

995
01:03:34,476 --> 01:03:37,078
that I had picked the
winning numbers for you too.

996
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:24,293
Are you done?

997
01:04:30,532 --> 01:04:32,599
Hey, you stupid
dog, where are you?

998
01:04:32,601 --> 01:04:33,969
Come on, where'd you go?

999
01:04:50,018 --> 01:04:52,254
Get out of the road, you bum.

1000
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,905
Rough night?

1001
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:11,537
Oh my God.

1002
01:05:11,539 --> 01:05:12,675
Where the hell am I?

1003
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,943
Hell's about right.

1004
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:16,612
Hey.

1005
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:18,681
What's your name?

1006
01:05:20,181 --> 01:05:21,049
Amy.

1007
01:05:24,686 --> 01:05:26,586
What's wrong with you?

1008
01:05:26,588 --> 01:05:27,456
Several things.

1009
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:39,133
What?

1010
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:43,103
I was just looking at all
the religious books you've got.

1011
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,206
Yeah, it was a phase.

1012
01:05:45,206 --> 01:05:46,141
You want 'em?

1013
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:48,544
Phase?

1014
01:05:50,278 --> 01:05:52,681
So you're like an
atheist now or something?

1015
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:55,551
I wish.

1016
01:05:59,454 --> 01:06:01,188
It's complicated.

1017
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:02,191
How can it not be?

1018
01:06:07,262 --> 01:06:12,268
As for me, I definitely
believe in God.

1019
01:06:13,068 --> 01:06:13,635
You do?

1020
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:17,606
Oh yes.

1021
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:23,545
I love him.

1022
01:06:34,356 --> 01:06:35,224
No.

1023
01:08:10,418 --> 01:08:12,251
Just a second.

1024
01:08:12,253 --> 01:08:13,521
Eric, it's Ed.

1025
01:08:35,877 --> 01:08:37,345
- Hey.
- Hi.

1026
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:41,317
Hey, I've been thinking
about you a lot lately.

1027
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:45,119
How much I miss
having you around?

1028
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:47,722
And not just 'cause you fix
things for me on the house.

1029
01:08:49,524 --> 01:08:51,191
JP and I were thinking about
doing a little fishing.

1030
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:53,729
I thought I'd see
what you're up to.

1031
01:08:55,296 --> 01:08:57,464
Oh, come on. I'll take
you out for an hour.

1032
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:58,799
I'll bring you back.

1033
01:08:58,801 --> 01:08:59,668
That's it.

1034
01:09:01,569 --> 01:09:04,571
I'm not really
feeling up to it today.

1035
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:06,540
I appreciate what
you're trying to do.

1036
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:08,808
Come on. You know, I
don't pull that crap.

1037
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:10,578
I just want to hang out
a little bit, come on.

1038
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,551
Who's your little friend?

1039
01:09:16,618 --> 01:09:17,617
I'm watching him for Stu.

1040
01:09:17,619 --> 01:09:19,318
Oh, bring him along.

1041
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:20,421
We'll use him for bait.

1042
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:35,871
Want some coffee?

1043
01:09:37,372 --> 01:09:38,239
No, thanks.

1044
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:42,409
Ed, I'm sorry I never
called you back.

1045
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:43,544
I meant to. I just-

1046
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:44,713
- You had your reasons.

1047
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,215
Christmas is such a
dichotomy, ain't it?

1048
01:09:49,217 --> 01:09:52,585
Happy for some, sad for others.

1049
01:09:52,587 --> 01:09:53,521
It's just a day.

1050
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:03,463
I used to spend
every Christmas

1051
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:06,200
waiting for my dad to come home.

1052
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:06,869
Where was he?

1053
01:10:07,869 --> 01:10:09,503
Don't know.

1054
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:10,873
Sometimes he'd be
gone for months,

1055
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:16,843
but no matter what,
for whatever reason,

1056
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:20,382
he'd always come
home for Christmas.

1057
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:26,956
Christmas when I was 14, first
time that he never showed.

1058
01:10:29,324 --> 01:10:31,260
I had stayed up all night

1059
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:35,663
like a little kid
waiting around for Santa.

1060
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:39,532
When did he come back?

1061
01:10:39,534 --> 01:10:40,802
Never saw him again.

1062
01:10:43,238 --> 01:10:47,408
I hated that I kept hoping
that he'd show up every year.

1063
01:10:53,548 --> 01:10:55,951
Hell, I'm almost 70 years old.

1064
01:10:57,485 --> 01:10:59,320
I'm still hoping
he'll show up today.

1065
01:11:00,521 --> 01:11:01,556
It's crazy.

1066
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:06,261
That's not crazy.

1067
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:22,011
Vanna, what are
you doing here?

1068
01:11:23,578 --> 01:11:25,044
Mom told grandma
that Eric's with you

1069
01:11:25,046 --> 01:11:26,847
and grandma told me.

1070
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:28,684
That big busybody.

1071
01:11:29,784 --> 01:11:30,918
- Hey, Eric.
- Hey.

1072
01:11:33,354 --> 01:11:35,022
Can I talk to you?

1073
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:37,359
Actually, your dad was
just about to take me home.

1074
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:39,762
Please?

1075
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:51,937
You're kinda freaking me
out there being so quiet.

1076
01:11:51,939 --> 01:11:53,341
It's not really like you.

1077
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:56,543
I'm sorry.

1078
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:58,411
No, it's fine.

1079
01:11:58,413 --> 01:12:01,015
I just expected you to
hit me with 20 questions.

1080
01:12:02,583 --> 01:12:03,983
Well, yeah, I mean
I have questions-

1081
01:12:03,985 --> 01:12:05,953
- So your dad says
you're in grad school.

1082
01:12:06,921 --> 01:12:08,988
- Yeah.
- That's great.

1083
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:09,858
That's great.

1084
01:12:11,426 --> 01:12:14,460
Eric, I want you to
come over to the house.

1085
01:12:14,462 --> 01:12:15,331
What?

1086
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:18,464
- No.
- No, no, it's okay.

1087
01:12:18,466 --> 01:12:19,499
I mean, it's just my
grandparents there

1088
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:20,634
and it's nothing big.

1089
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:22,971
Just for a little while, please.

1090
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:27,876
Please.

1091
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:47,460
How about some of Ethel's
cranberry gelatin relish, Eric?

1092
01:12:47,462 --> 01:12:48,130
No, thank you.

1093
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:50,062
Dad.

1094
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:51,397
Here. That enough?

1095
01:12:51,399 --> 01:12:52,833
He said he didn't want any.

1096
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:54,668
The boy's gotta
eat. He looks awful.

1097
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,035
- Grandpa.
- Give him a ham.

1098
01:12:56,037 --> 01:12:57,670
He needs protein.

1099
01:12:57,672 --> 01:12:58,839
Dad, how are you
feeling these days?

1100
01:12:58,841 --> 01:12:59,973
Not good at all?

1101
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:01,641
Eric, I still don't understand

1102
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:03,410
what really happened to you.

1103
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:04,710
Mama, let the boy eat.

1104
01:13:04,712 --> 01:13:06,112
No, no. It's okay.

1105
01:13:06,114 --> 01:13:09,449
I told you Ethel about
this wacky business

1106
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:11,819
with his spinal column
eating away at itself.

1107
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:15,688
It's so interesting that
it affects so many things.

1108
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:17,691
I know. It's crazy, huh?

1109
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:20,160
Well, don't you worry
about a thing, Eric.

1110
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:24,097
I have many friends over
at the Lutheran Manor

1111
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:25,866
who have problems
with their eyes,

1112
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:29,870
or legs or their arms.

1113
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:32,539
They're getting along just fine.

1114
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:33,641
That's good to know.

1115
01:13:48,055 --> 01:13:50,589
I was in
there in the hospital

1116
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:53,994
a couple of months ago
for the colon thing.

1117
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:55,728
The oscopy.

1118
01:13:55,730 --> 01:13:58,063
They took out a
couple of polyps.

1119
01:13:58,065 --> 01:14:00,166
Uncle Howard
thinks Eric's problem

1120
01:14:00,168 --> 01:14:02,501
can be caused by glaucoma.

1121
01:14:02,503 --> 01:14:03,637
Glaucoma?

1122
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:05,037
I have some glaucoma.

1123
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:07,808
Poor
Eric. Such a shame.

1124
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,809
And he was so handsome.

1125
01:14:09,811 --> 01:14:11,445
Now, he
looks like something

1126
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,446
that crawled out of a trash bag.

1127
01:14:20,788 --> 01:14:23,692
He didn't look good,
I can tell you that.

1128
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,187
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

1129
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:56,089
Merry Christmas.

1130
01:14:56,091 --> 01:14:58,090
Oh, sorry.

1131
01:14:58,092 --> 01:14:59,625
You called Stu?

1132
01:14:59,627 --> 01:15:00,828
Yeah, I gotta get back.

1133
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:08,268
Thursday
night into Friday,

1134
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:09,936
those will be the worst
travel conditions.

1135
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:11,071
This is a powerful winter storm.

1136
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:12,705
There's the low pressure area.

1137
01:15:12,707 --> 01:15:13,839
Let's put this in the most-

1138
01:15:13,841 --> 01:15:15,008
- What the hell are you doing?

1139
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,913
Why would you bring him here?

1140
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:24,284
Bro, I'm sorry.

1141
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:26,753
But it's nasty out there and
they even shut down the airport

1142
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:28,120
right after I arrived.

1143
01:15:28,122 --> 01:15:29,257
It took me two
hours to drive here.

1144
01:15:30,792 --> 01:15:32,858
We're not gonna make
it back tonight.

1145
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:34,727
It's a nightmare.

1146
01:15:34,729 --> 01:15:36,161
Corn relish comes shooting
out of me like bullets.

1147
01:15:36,163 --> 01:15:37,198
Maybe it'll be fun.

1148
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:41,968
Some nice hot tea.

1149
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:43,602
I'm so glad you
guys are staying.

1150
01:15:43,604 --> 01:15:45,706
It will be so much more
festive with you here.

1151
01:15:46,641 --> 01:15:47,542
Here we go.

1152
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:49,675
Here you go, sweetie.

1153
01:15:49,677 --> 01:15:51,143
- No, thank you.
- Okay, sweetie.

1154
01:15:51,145 --> 01:15:52,812
I'm gonna put you
in Vanessa's room.

1155
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:55,147
I hope you don't mind
sharing Vanessa's bed.

1156
01:15:55,149 --> 01:15:56,683
No.

1157
01:15:56,685 --> 01:15:58,754
We're both mature adults.

1158
01:15:59,787 --> 01:16:00,655
Good.

1159
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:08,894
Do you wanna know
what I'm wearing?

1160
01:16:08,896 --> 01:16:10,930
Stu, jeez no.

1161
01:16:10,932 --> 01:16:12,831
Sorry.

1162
01:16:12,833 --> 01:16:15,770
I just know how you feel about
full disclosure these days.

1163
01:16:19,073 --> 01:16:20,141
Take your dog.

1164
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:30,817
Hey, could I ask you something?

1165
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:32,054
Yeah, shoot.

1166
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:34,955
I mean, I can mostly tell,

1167
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:37,960
but Vanessa looks the
same to you, right?

1168
01:16:40,895 --> 01:16:43,097
Yeah, I'd say so.

1169
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:52,339
She was wearing this top thing

1170
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:55,008
that you could totally see
her bra straps through,

1171
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:57,309
and some jeans
that if I might add

1172
01:16:57,311 --> 01:16:59,280
were rather tight in the ass.

1173
01:17:01,115 --> 01:17:02,915
I never thought she
was particularly hot,

1174
01:17:02,917 --> 01:17:05,753
but she was pretty
smoking in 'em.

1175
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:17,630
Well, I'm beat.

1176
01:17:17,632 --> 01:17:18,833
You don't snore, do you?

1177
01:18:11,185 --> 01:18:12,420
Stu, go back to sleep.

1178
01:18:14,088 --> 01:18:14,956
It's Ed.

1179
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:17,857
Sorry, I heard a noise.

1180
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,861
I thought I'd come see
if everything was okay.

1181
01:18:21,195 --> 01:18:23,830
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to wake you.

1182
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:25,197
That's okay.

1183
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:26,068
No problem.

1184
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:30,269
Well, goodnight.

1185
01:18:30,271 --> 01:18:31,838
Hey, Ed.

1186
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:32,708
Yeah.

1187
01:18:34,975 --> 01:18:36,076
Do you remember
that woman from Kenya

1188
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:37,245
I was telling you about?

1189
01:18:39,213 --> 01:18:40,082
Yeah.

1190
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:44,349
Her entire life
has been nothing

1191
01:18:44,351 --> 01:18:46,121
but hunger and thirst, pain.

1192
01:18:49,323 --> 01:18:50,991
Suffering from day one.

1193
01:18:52,293 --> 01:18:53,327
It's heartbreaking.

1194
01:18:55,229 --> 01:18:59,734
Most people wouldn't even
give it a second thought.

1195
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:02,104
But you do.

1196
01:19:05,172 --> 01:19:06,505
Do you think that
there are people

1197
01:19:06,507 --> 01:19:08,777
that are just doomed or cursed?

1198
01:19:14,882 --> 01:19:17,483
There's an old Navajo
proverb that I love.

1199
01:19:17,485 --> 01:19:22,490
It says you can't wake a man
who's pretending to be asleep.

1200
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:27,893
Now, you can pretend that
you've thrown the towel in

1201
01:19:27,895 --> 01:19:31,966
and like, you're so pissed,
you can't even think straight,

1202
01:19:33,301 --> 01:19:37,105
but you're still wide
awake, aren't you?

1203
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:48,016
- You wanna sit down?
- No.

1204
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:54,288
You all right?

1205
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:56,321
Hurt my ankle.

1206
01:19:56,323 --> 01:19:57,358
Oh man. How?

1207
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:00,360
I went home last weekend.

1208
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:01,997
Got in a fight with my stepdad.

1209
01:20:03,364 --> 01:20:04,429
Who won.

1210
01:20:04,431 --> 01:20:05,300
I did.

1211
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:08,336
So the asshole pushed
me down the stairs.

1212
01:20:10,204 --> 01:20:11,305
It didn't hurt though.

1213
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:14,943
Well, you're
tougher than I was.

1214
01:20:18,846 --> 01:20:23,117
Here, I wanted to give you this.

1215
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:27,387
I'm not gonna
take your camera.

1216
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:29,022
Right, 'cause I'm
really gonna be using it.

1217
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,159
Here, I want you to have it.

1218
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:34,527
What am I gonna do with it?

1219
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:36,398
Probably just sell it.

1220
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:38,266
That's all right.

1221
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,136
Just before you sell
it, mess around with it.

1222
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:44,072
Best way to learn.

1223
01:20:53,914 --> 01:20:54,582
Hey.

1224
01:20:56,484 --> 01:20:57,352
Hey.

1225
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:00,419
Stu, ready?

1226
01:21:00,421 --> 01:21:02,321
Yeah, just about.

1227
01:21:02,323 --> 01:21:04,590
He's getting lectured by
my grandpa in Lutheranism

1228
01:21:04,592 --> 01:21:06,862
and the light bulb crisis.

1229
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:12,065
Whoa, there's a trash can.

1230
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:13,400
- Do you need help?
- No.

1231
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:19,039
I've been praying
really hard for you.

1232
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:22,107
You're going through
so much right now,

1233
01:21:22,109 --> 01:21:23,242
but if you just hang in there,

1234
01:21:23,244 --> 01:21:24,211
things are gonna get better.

1235
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:27,246
Look, I'm just trying to...

1236
01:21:27,248 --> 01:21:29,050
Well, I don't need you to.

1237
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:30,919
Fine.

1238
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:35,420
You know, it must be so
awesome going through life

1239
01:21:35,422 --> 01:21:37,357
not needing anything or anyone.

1240
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:38,223
I'm gonna go find Stu.

1241
01:21:38,225 --> 01:21:39,358
Okay. Yeah.

1242
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:40,362
Let's see you go find Stu.

1243
01:21:41,962 --> 01:21:42,629
What do you want
from me, Vanessa?

1244
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:43,265
Nothing.

1245
01:21:44,632 --> 01:21:46,501
You know, I used
to want you though.

1246
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:49,168
Not that that matters now.

1247
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:51,937
I would have been
there for you though.

1248
01:21:51,939 --> 01:21:53,572
Why?

1249
01:21:53,574 --> 01:21:54,907
To tell me stuff like
things are gonna get better?

1250
01:21:54,909 --> 01:21:55,642
Is that wrong?

1251
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:56,976
Yes.

1252
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:58,413
Because sometimes they don't.

1253
01:21:59,948 --> 01:22:01,446
Or is that just foreign
to someone like you?

1254
01:22:01,448 --> 01:22:03,516
What is your problem with me?

1255
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:07,152
Is my life not tragic
enough for you or something?

1256
01:22:07,154 --> 01:22:08,588
Like how much crap do
I have to go through

1257
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10,156
for you to sanction me

1258
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:11,223
into your elite
little suffering club?

1259
01:22:11,225 --> 01:22:12,357
Just stop it.

1260
01:22:12,359 --> 01:22:13,960
Do I have to lose my parents

1261
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:15,661
or have my face ripped
off by barbed wire

1262
01:22:15,663 --> 01:22:17,965
or be starving with malaria?

1263
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:21,036
Would any of that
be enough for you?

1264
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:24,102
- What?
- What?

1265
01:22:24,104 --> 01:22:26,173
What did you just
say about barbed wire?

1266
01:22:30,177 --> 01:22:32,010
I don't know.

1267
01:22:32,012 --> 01:22:33,446
I read about a woman
whose face got ripped off

1268
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:36,084
by barbed wire when she
was climbing a fence.

1269
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:40,519
It's not funny. It's horrible.

1270
01:22:40,521 --> 01:22:42,455
I know.

1271
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:46,227
Having your face ripped off
by barbed wire sounds awful.

1272
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:51,697
I just don't think I
ever want something bad

1273
01:22:51,699 --> 01:22:52,567
to happen to you.

1274
01:22:57,572 --> 01:22:58,705
What?

1275
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:00,005
What's going on, Eric?

1276
01:23:00,007 --> 01:23:01,406
What's going on?

1277
01:23:01,408 --> 01:23:02,308
It's my fine, it's
fine, it's fine.

1278
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,175
What, what?

1279
01:23:03,177 --> 01:23:04,509
Sit down.

1280
01:23:04,511 --> 01:23:05,380
It's my leg.

1281
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:07,679
It's fine. It's normal.

1282
01:23:07,681 --> 01:23:08,982
It's fine.

1283
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:09,517
- What can I do?
- Nothing.

1284
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,253
This was a mistake coming here.

1285
01:23:47,255 --> 01:23:48,187
Eric.

1286
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,155
Wait.

1287
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:50,555
Shit.

1288
01:23:50,557 --> 01:23:51,691
You know, I used to
stare at your paintings

1289
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:52,427
trying to figure you out?

1290
01:23:54,061 --> 01:23:55,495
They only told me
what I already knew

1291
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:57,062
after talking to you
for five minutes.

1292
01:23:57,064 --> 01:23:58,464
I know what
you're trying to do.

1293
01:23:58,466 --> 01:23:59,598
You're just scared
of facing things

1294
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,233
you don't have the answers for.

1295
01:24:01,235 --> 01:24:02,668
You're scared of
opening your eyes

1296
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:02,804
and seeing things
as they really are.

1297
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:10,645
V, I'm sorry.

1298
01:24:11,712 --> 01:24:13,414
Just so you know, I don't...

1299
01:24:32,266 --> 01:24:34,200
Crap. Kelley's here.

1300
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:35,567
Where have you been?

1301
01:24:35,569 --> 01:24:38,504
At Vanessa's
house. I texted you.

1302
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:39,371
You texted me?

1303
01:24:39,373 --> 01:24:40,807
Yeah.

1304
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:42,442
It's Christmas
day, you schlarb.

1305
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:44,343
I know. I drove
as fast as I could.

1306
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:45,745
What are you talking about?

1307
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,813
Do you know how
long I was waiting?

1308
01:24:47,815 --> 01:24:49,415
You do this every time.

1309
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:50,817
I was sitting there
with my parents.

1310
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:52,454
They were wondering
where you were.

1311
01:24:54,288 --> 01:24:56,222
Someone has got
to say something.

1312
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:59,525
Eric, are you aware that
every time we go out,

1313
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:01,794
Stu insists on coming
back here to check on you?

1314
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:03,629
That is not true.

1315
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:05,464
Look, I know that
you got a raw deal,

1316
01:25:05,466 --> 01:25:09,269
but you have got to stop
relying on Stu for everything.

1317
01:25:10,204 --> 01:25:11,204
I don't need Stu.

1318
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:12,671
See, I told you.

1319
01:25:12,673 --> 01:25:14,639
So Eric
has nothing to do

1320
01:25:14,641 --> 01:25:17,144
with you turning down
that fellowship in Belize?

1321
01:25:22,516 --> 01:25:23,417
What fellowship?

1322
01:25:25,886 --> 01:25:27,285
You know?

1323
01:25:27,287 --> 01:25:28,620
I told you.

1324
01:25:28,622 --> 01:25:29,621
- No, you didn't.
- Really?

1325
01:25:29,623 --> 01:25:30,524
I thought that...

1326
01:25:32,193 --> 01:25:33,326
It's nothing.

1327
01:25:33,328 --> 01:25:34,729
I decided not to take it anyway.

1328
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:38,900
Why not?

1329
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:41,302
Come on.

1330
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:44,137
Who wants to live in Belize?

1331
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:46,671
Besides, you know I hate
moving, and the ocean.

1332
01:25:46,673 --> 01:25:48,374
It was a great opportunity,

1333
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:50,576
and he was handpicked
out of 1000 applicants.

1334
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:52,245
I didn't wanna take it.

1335
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:53,646
So drop it.

1336
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:55,147
- You are such a liar.
- Shut up, Kelley.

1337
01:25:55,149 --> 01:25:56,848
No, you know what?

1338
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:58,451
I am not gonna sit back and
watch you trash your life

1339
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:00,288
because someone else
chooses to trash theirs.

1340
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:09,928
If I find out that
I had anything to do

1341
01:26:09,930 --> 01:26:11,865
with you not taking
that fellowship...

1342
01:26:23,645 --> 01:26:25,277
Why would you do that?

1343
01:26:25,279 --> 01:26:26,678
Why did you have
to do that today?

1344
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,281
Because somebody
had to say something.

1345
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:30,415
No, I would have told
him if you would...

1346
01:26:30,417 --> 01:26:31,416
When were you gonna tell him?

1347
01:26:31,418 --> 01:26:32,852
It doesn't matter.

1348
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,586
I don't need your
help with this.

1349
01:26:34,588 --> 01:26:36,188
- You don't need my help?
- No, I don't.

1350
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:36,356
- Okay.
- Goodbye. Merry Christmas.

1351
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:45,533
Hey, man.

1352
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,601
Hey, I'm sorry about that.

1353
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:50,535
She's pissed, because I
won't move in with her.

1354
01:26:50,537 --> 01:26:52,639
Yeah, well, she's
right about one thing.

1355
01:26:54,841 --> 01:26:55,710
You're a liar.

1356
01:26:57,845 --> 01:26:59,778
Go to Belize.

1357
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:01,513
What if I did go?

1358
01:27:01,515 --> 01:27:02,583
And what would you do?

1359
01:27:03,917 --> 01:27:05,585
You spend all the money
Uncle Sam gives you

1360
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:07,887
on nothing but booze,
cigarettes and cereal.

1361
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,789
Wear the same two disgusting
shirts all the time

1362
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:11,656
and you generally look like
complete and utter shit.

1363
01:27:11,658 --> 01:27:13,558
So yeah, man. Yeah.

1364
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,928
You're the poster child
of self sufficiency.

1365
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:17,530
- Absolutely.
- It's my life.

1366
01:27:17,532 --> 01:27:18,964
Yup. It is.

1367
01:27:18,966 --> 01:27:20,833
What's all this shit of
indeterminate origin?

1368
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:22,835
You're doing drugs now?

1369
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:23,902
How about your scholarship?

1370
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,805
Plan on using it?

1371
01:27:26,506 --> 01:27:27,906
- No.
- Yeah.

1372
01:27:27,908 --> 01:27:29,442
I guess it's kinda
hard to go to college

1373
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:30,979
if you haven't finished
high school yet.

1374
01:27:33,347 --> 01:27:36,415
You got a letter from the
department of education

1375
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:38,453
asking when you're
gonna start your GED.

1376
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:42,655
Can't just cease to
exist, so how about it?

1377
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:44,290
Did you even finish high school?

1378
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:45,290
Why do you care?

1379
01:27:45,292 --> 01:27:46,826
I don't even know.

1380
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:48,427
God.

1381
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:50,263
In the few years
of living together,

1382
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:51,599
you'd figure it's something
that might've come up.

1383
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:54,567
The least you can do is
let some sunlight in here.

1384
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:56,001
What the hell for, you moron.

1385
01:27:56,003 --> 01:27:57,836
For vitamin fucking
D man. I don't know.

1386
01:27:57,838 --> 01:27:59,472
You know what? You're just
pissed 'cause you're stuck here.

1387
01:27:59,474 --> 01:28:02,441
I'm not stuck here.
I'm going back to Kenya.

1388
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:04,442
Oh my God. That's ludicrous.

1389
01:28:04,444 --> 01:28:06,611
God, man. You're screwed
up, you know that?

1390
01:28:06,613 --> 01:28:08,046
Man, I don't even think
you care about Kenya.

1391
01:28:08,048 --> 01:28:09,514
I think you just use
them as an excuse

1392
01:28:09,516 --> 01:28:11,452
so you can get out of here.

1393
01:28:16,890 --> 01:28:18,023
Get off me.

1394
01:28:18,025 --> 01:28:18,960
Get off me.

1395
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:45,518
Not now, JP.

1396
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,587
Take a 'lude, Vanna.

1397
01:28:48,456 --> 01:28:49,487
Eric gave me his camera.

1398
01:28:49,489 --> 01:28:50,358
He did?

1399
01:28:51,893 --> 01:28:54,761
And I threw all of his
pictures on your dad's computer.

1400
01:28:56,564 --> 01:28:58,566
Thought you might like to see
them before I delete them.

1401
01:29:40,073 --> 01:29:41,639
Stay right there.

1402
01:29:41,641 --> 01:29:42,676
I'm gonna grab a camera.

1403
01:29:53,554 --> 01:29:55,821
Matua, I'll be able to get
around on my own, I promise.

1404
01:29:55,823 --> 01:29:57,757
You won't have to
do anything for me.

1405
01:29:57,759 --> 01:29:59,993
I'll live in the village.
I'll sleep anywhere.

1406
01:30:01,061 --> 01:30:02,462
All I want is to come back.

1407
01:30:11,905 --> 01:30:13,774
Come here, little guy.

1408
01:30:19,947 --> 01:30:21,481
Jeffrey.

1409
01:30:22,449 --> 01:30:23,616
It's mom.

1410
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:24,485
Open up.

1411
01:30:27,454 --> 01:30:28,454
Jeffrey.

1412
01:30:28,456 --> 01:30:30,089
Honey, I need your help.

1413
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:31,790
I lost my job and I just
need to borrow a little cash.

1414
01:30:31,792 --> 01:30:33,425
- You're strung out.
- No, no, I promise.

1415
01:30:33,427 --> 01:30:34,125
I can smell the
drugs all over you.

1416
01:30:34,127 --> 01:30:35,460
No, I'm not.

1417
01:30:35,462 --> 01:30:36,594
I was with some people that use,

1418
01:30:36,596 --> 01:30:38,496
but it's all behind me, I swear.

1419
01:30:38,498 --> 01:30:40,132
Listen honey, I need you.

1420
01:30:40,134 --> 01:30:42,034
No, stop it, stop it.

1421
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:44,939
Listen. I need you to please
show me that you love me.

1422
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:49,110
Who are you?

1423
01:30:50,645 --> 01:30:51,943
- Vanessa.
- I'm sorry.

1424
01:30:51,945 --> 01:30:53,545
I didn't mean interrupt
you. I just...

1425
01:30:53,547 --> 01:30:55,447
Vanessa, what
are you doing here?

1426
01:30:55,449 --> 01:30:56,882
I tried to call you, but
you never answer your phone.

1427
01:30:56,884 --> 01:30:58,517
V, just please go.
I will call you later.

1428
01:30:58,519 --> 01:30:59,852
I know all about
girls like you.

1429
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:00,986
- I shouldn't have come.
- You're in love

1430
01:31:00,988 --> 01:31:02,120
with my Jeffrey, aren't you?

1431
01:31:02,122 --> 01:31:03,121
- Stop it.
- No.

1432
01:31:03,123 --> 01:31:04,757
Vanessa, please go.

1433
01:31:04,759 --> 01:31:05,126
Mothers can always
tell these things.

1434
01:31:10,163 --> 01:31:12,031
I just came to
return your sweatshirt

1435
01:31:12,033 --> 01:31:14,602
that you left at our
house and here, take it.

1436
01:31:16,237 --> 01:31:17,937
And to tell you that...

1437
01:31:17,939 --> 01:31:19,707
All I wanted was
to know you too.

1438
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:25,076
Vanessa, wait.

1439
01:31:26,514 --> 01:31:27,181
Vanessa.

1440
01:31:28,949 --> 01:31:29,817
Vanessa.

1441
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:37,156
I'll be damned.

1442
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,590
You remember Buzz?

1443
01:31:38,592 --> 01:31:40,159
He still takes good care of me.

1444
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:41,826
What the hell
happened to you, kid?

1445
01:31:41,828 --> 01:31:42,995
This is why you want
me to stay outside?

1446
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:43,995
Leave him alone.

1447
01:31:43,997 --> 01:31:45,030
Leave him alone.

1448
01:31:45,032 --> 01:31:45,930
He's sick, okay Buzz.

1449
01:31:45,932 --> 01:31:47,532
He's sick.

1450
01:31:47,534 --> 01:31:48,534
Come on, obviously
you could use some help.

1451
01:31:48,536 --> 01:31:50,201
Don't touch me.

1452
01:31:50,203 --> 01:31:51,070
Oh my God.

1453
01:31:51,072 --> 01:31:52,670
Oh my God.

1454
01:31:52,672 --> 01:31:53,839
God, that son of yours
just broke my nose.

1455
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:54,940
Don't worry about it.

1456
01:31:54,942 --> 01:31:55,810
Come on.

1457
01:31:57,011 --> 01:31:58,079
Just come on.

1458
01:32:02,516 --> 01:32:04,050
Stay away from me.

1459
01:32:05,152 --> 01:32:07,221
Buzz, come on. Stop it.

1460
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:11,223
Be quiet.

1461
01:32:12,659 --> 01:32:15,193
Where do you think you're going?

1462
01:32:15,195 --> 01:32:17,595
I told you what would
happen if you ran away,

1463
01:32:17,597 --> 01:32:19,598
you little faggot.

1464
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,535
You owe me.

1465
01:32:21,868 --> 01:32:23,802
I swear to God,
I'll fucking kill you.

1466
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:25,605
Your mom still
needs you, Jeffy.

1467
01:32:27,641 --> 01:32:30,142
I still have a lot of
customers that'd be into you,

1468
01:32:30,144 --> 01:32:31,811
pretty little face like yours.

1469
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,879
You got yourself all worked up.

1470
01:32:34,881 --> 01:32:36,982
You could still make a
good little hooker, I bet.

1471
01:32:36,984 --> 01:32:39,250
- Oh God, help me.
- I'm gonna take care of you.

1472
01:32:39,252 --> 01:32:41,152
Please get off me.

1473
01:32:41,154 --> 01:32:42,556
Please get off.

1474
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:50,696
Oh God, I missed you.

1475
01:32:50,698 --> 01:32:53,132
Look what we have here.

1476
01:32:53,134 --> 01:32:55,202
You better look out, kid.

1477
01:33:07,247 --> 01:33:08,114
Mom.

1478
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:20,927
Eric.

1479
01:33:26,199 --> 01:33:27,068
Eric.

1480
01:33:31,104 --> 01:33:31,972
Eric.

1481
01:33:34,774 --> 01:33:35,773
Oh my God, man.

1482
01:33:35,775 --> 01:33:37,742
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

1483
01:33:37,744 --> 01:33:39,644
I'm so sorry.

1484
01:33:39,646 --> 01:33:42,113
I lost the dog.

1485
01:33:42,115 --> 01:33:43,816
I can't find him.

1486
01:33:43,818 --> 01:33:44,849
We will find him.

1487
01:33:44,851 --> 01:33:46,018
I lost the dog.

1488
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:47,018
I lost the dog.

1489
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:47,885
It's okay, man.

1490
01:33:47,887 --> 01:33:49,254
It's okay.

1491
01:33:49,256 --> 01:33:51,255
I swear, we'll find him.

1492
01:33:51,257 --> 01:33:52,891
Come on, man.

1493
01:33:52,893 --> 01:33:54,026
You can't stay in here
like this, come on.

1494
01:33:54,028 --> 01:33:55,126
I don't know, you know.

1495
01:33:55,128 --> 01:33:57,362
You know I don't know.

1496
01:33:57,364 --> 01:33:58,763
But what is to know?

1497
01:33:58,765 --> 01:34:00,766
Do you know?

1498
01:34:00,768 --> 01:34:02,701
- You know-
- Here you go, hun.

1499
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:03,337
Thanks.

1500
01:34:09,877 --> 01:34:12,413
I write poems,
did you know that?

1501
01:34:13,713 --> 01:34:15,082
No. Like what?

1502
01:34:17,150 --> 01:34:19,854
Roses are red,
violets are blue.

1503
01:34:21,188 --> 01:34:24,358
If you needed a kidney,
I'd give one to you.

1504
01:34:26,694 --> 01:34:27,328
Funny.

1505
01:34:31,798 --> 01:34:33,667
Here, sign me up.
I'll go up there.

1506
01:34:36,302 --> 01:34:37,438
Wait, are you serious?

1507
01:35:01,395 --> 01:35:05,731
I've never done this before,

1508
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:07,802
but what the hell, right?

1509
01:37:26,306 --> 01:37:28,474
Hi. You're
Jeffrey, right?

1510
01:37:32,145 --> 01:37:33,277
I don't know. I don't know.

1511
01:37:33,279 --> 01:37:35,112
He's not in the apartment.

1512
01:37:35,114 --> 01:37:36,548
I looked like five blocks
away from the house.

1513
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:37,883
I can't find him anywhere.

1514
01:37:37,885 --> 01:37:38,953
I don't know where he is.

1515
01:37:40,186 --> 01:37:41,622
I didn't know who else to call.

1516
01:37:47,293 --> 01:37:48,962
Hey, here you go.

1517
01:38:00,039 --> 01:38:01,440
Why did you come back here?

1518
01:38:01,442 --> 01:38:03,141
Yeah, you maybe
have some rough times,

1519
01:38:03,143 --> 01:38:05,110
but you got outta here.

1520
01:38:05,112 --> 01:38:06,180
You had a life, man.

1521
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:10,551
I had a lie.

1522
01:38:24,265 --> 01:38:25,664
Ed.

1523
01:38:25,666 --> 01:38:26,999
Yeah.

1524
01:38:27,001 --> 01:38:27,501
This is your old camera.

1525
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:31,038
What would it be doing here?

1526
01:38:37,344 --> 01:38:39,311
I thought teaching an art
class to a bunch of people

1527
01:38:39,313 --> 01:38:43,214
that didn't have a place
to live was so stupid.

1528
01:38:43,216 --> 01:38:44,585
I was just trying to survive.

1529
01:38:46,619 --> 01:38:48,253
I'm Ed.

1530
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:49,590
That's my daughter, Vanessa.

1531
01:38:51,158 --> 01:38:52,459
I knew it was her.

1532
01:38:53,927 --> 01:38:54,927
You're hungry?

1533
01:38:54,929 --> 01:38:56,361
Oh, maybe later.

1534
01:38:56,363 --> 01:38:58,562
I teach philosophy.
That's my day job.

1535
01:38:58,564 --> 01:39:00,500
It's either that or
write fortune cookies.

1536
01:39:04,305 --> 01:39:06,037
Wow.

1537
01:39:06,039 --> 01:39:07,106
Look at this.

1538
01:39:10,444 --> 01:39:14,478
Here. Keep capturing
this monumental moment.

1539
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,113
I don't know how to use this.

1540
01:39:16,115 --> 01:39:17,984
Experiment. That's
the way to learn.

1541
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:22,254
Always impressed when
I see a photographer

1542
01:39:22,256 --> 01:39:26,023
with the bravery to take
a shot up at close range.

1543
01:39:26,025 --> 01:39:27,027
No, no, no. Keep it.

1544
01:39:28,362 --> 01:39:29,961
- What?
- No, I want you to have it.

1545
01:39:29,963 --> 01:39:31,631
I have no idea
why he gave it to me

1546
01:39:32,699 --> 01:39:34,233
and I never even thanked him.

1547
01:39:37,738 --> 01:39:39,504
I never intended to lie to them.

1548
01:39:39,506 --> 01:39:41,608
It's just somewhere
along the way

1549
01:39:43,176 --> 01:39:45,179
it was nice not having
a history for a change.

1550
01:39:50,016 --> 01:39:50,684
I'm tired.

1551
01:40:16,076 --> 01:40:16,743
Jeff.

1552
01:40:19,046 --> 01:40:20,512
Jeff.

1553
01:40:20,514 --> 01:40:21,382
Hey, wait.

1554
01:40:36,596 --> 01:40:37,463
Wait.

1555
01:40:38,498 --> 01:40:39,731
Wait.

1556
01:40:39,733 --> 01:40:42,168
Jeff, where are you going?

1557
01:40:48,341 --> 01:40:49,208
Stop.

1558
01:40:53,146 --> 01:40:53,814
Stop.

1559
01:40:57,717 --> 01:41:00,384
I've never done this before,

1560
01:41:00,386 --> 01:41:01,587
but what the hell, right?

1561
01:41:04,757 --> 01:41:07,260
Have you ever wondered
on your daily commute

1562
01:41:08,796 --> 01:41:10,695
while you take in the
sights and the smells

1563
01:41:10,697 --> 01:41:12,330
of the world around you

1564
01:41:12,332 --> 01:41:13,734
through a tempered glass
and air conditioning,

1565
01:41:15,301 --> 01:41:17,369
if there's less
to life than this?

1566
01:41:17,371 --> 01:41:20,371
Less than your job and your
house, your hot girlfriend,

1567
01:41:20,373 --> 01:41:21,673
the sex you're having,

1568
01:41:21,675 --> 01:41:24,144
the sex you wish
you were having?

1569
01:41:25,779 --> 01:41:28,546
I'm not gonna spew a
courageous story of survival

1570
01:41:28,548 --> 01:41:30,315
to restore anyone's
hope in mankind

1571
01:41:30,317 --> 01:41:33,119
'cause it doesn't exist.

1572
01:41:34,488 --> 01:41:36,420
I'm just a bug in a jar

1573
01:41:36,422 --> 01:41:39,391
straining to squeeze my
contorted, splitting flesh

1574
01:41:39,393 --> 01:41:41,561
through a nail-poked
hole in the lid.

1575
01:41:44,597 --> 01:41:48,335
At night, I still see her
emaciated form pleading.

1576
01:41:49,869 --> 01:41:51,535
Her starving body
feeding itself with grief

1577
01:41:51,537 --> 01:41:53,705
as she sobs dry tears
over her lifeless baby

1578
01:41:53,707 --> 01:41:55,507
stiffening in her arms.

1579
01:41:55,509 --> 01:41:57,108
She's locked her eyes to mine

1580
01:41:57,110 --> 01:41:58,576
and I desperately
seek some callousness

1581
01:41:58,578 --> 01:42:00,812
to force my eyes away,
but everywhere I turn,

1582
01:42:00,814 --> 01:42:03,650
she's there and I curse her.

1583
01:42:05,185 --> 01:42:06,884
Because the shit I've seen

1584
01:42:06,886 --> 01:42:08,320
has burned a hole
so deep inside of me

1585
01:42:08,322 --> 01:42:10,354
that everything blurs,

1586
01:42:10,356 --> 01:42:12,391
and the only thing
that I can see clearly

1587
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:15,759
is some almighty son of a bitch,

1588
01:42:15,761 --> 01:42:18,398
hell bent on making a
sick believer out of me.

1589
01:42:25,204 --> 01:42:27,608
I would love to be an atheist,

1590
01:42:28,908 --> 01:42:31,209
but when you are sitting there

1591
01:42:31,211 --> 01:42:33,180
sucking down on your
peppermint latte,

1592
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:38,185
and she's digging a grave in
the dry dirt for her dead baby,

1593
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,256
I simply can't
escape the obvious

1594
01:42:44,757 --> 01:42:49,395
that somebody up there is
just fucking with all of us.

1595
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:12,719
Where have you been?

1596
01:43:28,801 --> 01:43:29,670
Fuck you.

1597
01:44:35,868 --> 01:44:37,804
You have been so thirsty,

1598
01:44:41,841 --> 01:44:43,876
but your cries are heard.

1599
01:46:04,490 --> 01:46:05,359
Hurry.

1600
01:46:06,693 --> 01:46:07,561
Come on.

1601
01:46:16,103 --> 01:46:16,970
- Hey.
- Hey.

1602
01:46:18,438 --> 01:46:19,637
Here you go.

1603
01:46:19,639 --> 01:46:20,571
- Thank you.
- You okay?

1604
01:46:20,573 --> 01:46:22,374
Yeah.

1605
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:23,775
You want me to hang around?
I can wait downstairs.

1606
01:46:23,777 --> 01:46:25,078
No, you should
be home with Vanna.

1607
01:46:26,546 --> 01:46:28,414
I love you.

1608
01:46:35,956 --> 01:46:36,823
Eric.

1609
01:46:37,890 --> 01:46:38,757
It's okay, hey.

1610
01:46:38,759 --> 01:46:39,626
It's me.

1611
01:46:41,528 --> 01:46:42,396
It's Ed.

1612
01:46:47,033 --> 01:46:48,769
I think this belongs to you.

1613
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:07,953
I'm sorry.

1614
01:47:11,490 --> 01:47:12,492
It's okay.

1615
01:47:13,827 --> 01:47:14,694
Son,

1616
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:19,998
I don't know why
some people suffer

1617
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,469
through drought
longer than others,

1618
01:47:23,837 --> 01:47:26,106
but the rain always
comes eventually.

1619
01:47:27,807 --> 01:47:30,942
And when it does, the
desperate, barren, thirsty earth

1620
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:35,513
quenches itself in a way
that the lush, green earth

1621
01:47:35,515 --> 01:47:39,017
could never imagine
or understand.

1622
01:47:39,019 --> 01:47:42,853
And I have to live
in this tension

1623
01:47:42,855 --> 01:47:45,925
because that is
where the fire is.

1624
01:48:54,828 --> 01:48:56,730
I think he's pooping.

1625
01:49:11,110 --> 01:49:12,610
Hey, hey, hey, slow down.

1626
01:49:12,612 --> 01:49:13,745
Here's your camera, dad.

1627
01:49:13,747 --> 01:49:14,745
Get anything good, buddy?

1628
01:49:14,747 --> 01:49:16,315
Yeah, a caterpillar.

1629
01:49:18,118 --> 01:49:19,250
Hey, Eric,
you almost done in there?

1630
01:49:19,252 --> 01:49:20,250
Yeah, I'll be right there.

1631
01:49:26,826 --> 01:49:27,925
Come
on, help mommy out.

1632
01:49:27,927 --> 01:49:29,928
Grab us some plates.

1633
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:32,229
Mom, do you want
us to feed him?

1634
01:49:32,231 --> 01:49:34,165
No, no,
your brother first.

1635
01:49:34,167 --> 01:49:35,098
- Yes.
- No.

1636
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,034
- Yes.
- No.

1637
01:49:36,036 --> 01:49:37,168
- Yes.
- No.

1638
01:49:37,170 --> 01:49:38,769
We caught a caterpillar,

1639
01:49:38,771 --> 01:49:40,204
then it pooped, and then
it fell off the leaf

1640
01:49:40,206 --> 01:49:41,673
and then we took
tons of pictures.

1641
01:49:41,675 --> 01:49:43,308
Really?

1642
01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:45,175
Walked down the
path, and we had dad's camera

1643
01:49:45,177 --> 01:49:49,147
and we took pictures of
trees and interesting rocks

1644
01:49:49,149 --> 01:49:50,915
and a big fish was in the creek.

1645
01:49:50,917 --> 01:49:51,982
Oh wow.

1646
01:49:54,982 --> 01:49:58,982
