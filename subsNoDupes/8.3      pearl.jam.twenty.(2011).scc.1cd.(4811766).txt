1
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:09,244
sa Mother Love Bone,
ste imali nekog uspeha

2
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:10,837
i to je bila tragedija.

3
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:12,213
I sta ste odlucili

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,915
da ne nastavim sa
Mother Love Bone

5
00:00:14,274 --> 00:00:15,775
i da se formira nesto
sasvim drugacije

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,718
Jer je u tom momenu bilo staro

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,178
A mi smo hteli nesto novo

8
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:21,280
I to je ono sto 
radimo sada, novo i sveze

9
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:24,075
I onda su me videli u grudnjaku,
i to je bilo to

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,901
rekli su
"Moramo ga imati"

11
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:28,571
To je bilo pre nego sto je njegov prednji
zub bio izbijen

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,074

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,208
Imam vremensku prognozu

14
00:00:49,475 --> 00:00:51,878
za vas,
i nije dobra.

15
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:57,258
KCMU. Seattle's rock izvestaj.

16
00:00:57,859 --> 00:00:59,027
Sta je to sto vodi

17
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:00,987
hiljade mladih andjeoskog lica

18
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:03,072
u nasa mirna, drvoredna naselja

19
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:05,892
da potrose svoje naknade
na Marshall pojacala?

20
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,021
zasto se to dogadja?

21
00:01:11,498 --> 00:01:13,900
Uistinu,uvek je bila
odlicna scena u  Seattle.

22
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:17,328
Ako zelite ostar, agresivan

23
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:20,031
i emotivan rock-and-roll,
onda dodjite u  The Off Ramp

24
00:01:20,756 --> 00:01:23,125
u petak 5. jula

25
00:01:24,093 --> 00:01:26,496
Wowwee!

26
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,041
to jos niste videli

27
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,362
Moje ime je Cameron Crowe,
i ja sam rock novinar

28
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:02,373
kad sam se preselio u Sijetl
sredinom osamdesetih

29
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:04,826
postao sam svestan cele 
scene muzicara

30
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:06,736
koji stvarno rade zajedno da stvore

31
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:08,730
sopstveni svet uticaja

32
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,840
i bendova i zajednice

33
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:12,600
Odmah sam shvatio

34
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:15,136
koliko je to drugacije
od mesta gde sam odrastao

35
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:18,088
i od muzike koju sam slusao
u juznoj kaliforniji

36
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:20,416
to je bila muzika iz momaka

37
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:22,585
koji su dosta bili u kucama

38
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:25,430
Imali su dosta vremena da sviraju
i dosta vremena da slusaju.

39
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:28,975
Slusali su sve,

40
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,353
hard rock, hair metal, glam,
R&B, soul, disco, blues,

41
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:37,074
i sve je to zajedno uokvireno
u ovaj magicni miks

42
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:41,904
velicanstveni,melodicni, hard rock.

43
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,369
Morali smo da odemo da vidimo shou
koji je bio u  The U-Men,

44
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,972
i da vidimo te momke,

45
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:52,816
i ti momci bi dosli da vide nas.

46
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:54,459
Ponekad bismo otvorili za te momke

47
00:02:54,768 --> 00:02:57,170
bili su poput nas, sviramo

48
00:02:57,979 --> 00:02:59,147
Dvojica koe sam upoznao ranije

49
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,940
bili su Stone Gossard i Jeff Ament.

50
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,384
bili su u lokalnom, poznatom bendu, 
Green River,

51
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:06,303
i ocigledno je bilo da je dosta ljudi vezano za njih

52
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:08,982
Svake noci u Sjetlu,

53
00:03:09,324 --> 00:03:10,925
nije bilo tesko
Stone i Jeffu

54
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,027
da izlaze
i slusaju muziku uzivo.

55
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:15,321
Hajde da uradimo nesto vise od 
intimnih stvari

56
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:18,191
Sedi pored mene, sedi samnom, dete

57
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:24,606
Oni ljudi tamo,

58
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:26,307
policajci.Talas ka njima.

59
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:29,035
Kako si?

60
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:32,697
Ovo nije MTV, ali je dobro

61
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:35,500
moze biti bilo kad.

62
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:39,387
Sarkasticni policajci,
odlicno

63
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:42,382
Trebalo bi da udjemo
da vidimo The Cult veceras,

64
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:45,718
ali se za sada niko nije pojavio.

65
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:48,221
konacno smo usli na koncert.

66
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:49,989
Dugo smo bili napolju i nisu
hteli da nas puste

67
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,999
ali imamo ovo,
backstage propusnicu.

68
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:54,477
kako to da niste dosli ranije
da mi date moju propusnicu?

69
00:03:54,994 --> 00:03:55,995
bio sam dugo npolju.

70
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:57,313
Bili smo dugo napolju,

71
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,115
ovo je moj svedok

72
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:00,400
jer mi nikad ne verujes.

73
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,360
nikad mi ne verujes, Stone.
nikad mi jebeno ne verujes.

74
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:03,928
znao sam kad sam upoznao Stonea,

75
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,046
nisam mogao da zamislim
da izlazim okolo sa momkom.

76
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:07,873
Mark Arm me upoznao,

77
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,618
i izmedju 5 i  30 sekundi,
hteo je vec da me udari.

78
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:14,931
Dobro sam bio poznat

79
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:17,041
u svetu sarkazma,

80
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:19,377
i zbog toga je to bio 
za mene najveci uzitak

81
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:21,087
koji neko moze da ima

82
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,230
ovde...

83
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:25,858
Rock populacija svih zanrova,

84
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,803
Susan Silver, Chris Cornell,
Jeff Ament.

85
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,675
Uvek smo imali malo sumnje.

86
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,528
Osecali smo se da ako neko dolazi 
iz Nju jorka

87
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,523
ili Cikaga, mineapolisa ili Atine,

88
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:43,142
sigurno je bolji,
ali takodje je bio

89
00:04:43,626 --> 00:04:46,028
stav, nekako cemo
mi istrajati.

90
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:50,424
Bilo je jako drugacije

91
00:04:50,716 --> 00:04:52,618
od scene Los Andjelesa ili Nju Jorka.

92
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:54,829
Bilo je desetine grupa u Sjetlu,

93
00:04:55,263 --> 00:04:57,665
i oni su se svi poznavali,
i svi su govorili o

94
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:00,860
Dzefovom i Stonovom novom bendu,
Mother Love Bone,

95
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,838
i njihovom zapanjujucem
harizmaticnom frontmenu.

96
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,841
Njegovo ime je  Andy Wood.

97
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,433
Zeleo sam da svet sazna
da Mother Love Bone dolazi

98
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,812
da bi svet obuzelo obilje uzitka,

99
00:05:20,746 --> 00:05:23,149
ozitak kompota od vocne salate

100
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,068
Bio je odlican zabavljac.
Ljudi su ga obozavali

101
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:37,038
Mislim, ljudi su voleli da vide to sto radi.

102
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:39,466
Bio je smesan.
Radio bi nesto, kao,

103
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:42,210
otisao bi u centralnu birtiju gde sedi 25 ljudi

104
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:44,904
nastupio bi kao da je u koloseumu

105
00:05:45,313 --> 00:05:47,182
"Za sve vas pozadi!"

106
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:50,051
And there's, like, two...
There's the guy at the door.

107
00:05:51,194 --> 00:05:52,729
He was a rock star. He knew it.

108
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:55,515
And something about that...
I'll speak for everyone...

109
00:05:56,324 --> 00:05:58,726
Made us believe that we were, too.

110
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:02,105
I want to get
on an arena tour with some band.

111
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:05,733
Who cares?
Warrant, for that matter.

112
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:09,062
What the hell?
Go on tour with Warrant.

113
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:10,838
Just so we can play arenas.

114
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,306
That's the kind of crowd I like.

115
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,058
There's an easy crowd.

116
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:15,526
You can say anything.

117
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:18,204
You can say,
"Your mother smells bad, people!"

118
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,582
And they'll just go, "Yeah! Yeah!"

119
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:24,376
There are certain people
you just know that you love,

120
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,345
and you'll do anything for them.

121
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:27,764
You just wanted him
to be a rock star.

122
00:06:28,023 --> 00:06:29,991
You just saw it and were like,
"I'm on your team.

123
00:06:30,483 --> 00:06:32,352
"I want to be anywhere near you."

124
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,221
We're going down to L.A.
On Monday to record an album.

125
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:45,840
Do you think you're
the band of the '90s?

126
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:47,517
Do you think you're gonna be
one of the forerunners?

127
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:49,168
I think so. I hope so.

128
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:51,070
I mean, I thought I always
would be involved

129
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:52,430
in the band of the '90s.

130
00:06:52,714 --> 00:06:54,015
So if we're not the band
of the '90s,

131
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,475
I'm gonna fire my band
and get a new one,

132
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:59,178
and then they'll be
the band of the '90s.

133
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,922
'Cause you know what was weird?

134
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:03,091
Like, I was listening
to the bottom end of all the songs,

135
00:07:03,558 --> 00:07:05,260
'cause I was kind of worried
about Stardog, you know,

136
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:06,927
and the bottom end of it...

137
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:08,663
The first guy that I called

138
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:11,056
to see if he wanted to be
my roommate was Stone Gossard.

139
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,034
He was living at home, I think,
and he answered the phone,

140
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:14,735
and he's like,

141
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:17,071
"Yeah, no, I'm good.
I don't really want to...

142
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,306
"I don't really want to change
my living situation right now."

143
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,742
And he was at home, so I thought
that was a little weird.

144
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:24,646
But I thought,
"Whatever. That's great."

145
00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:27,857
And he said,
"But Andy just got out of rehab,

146
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,819
"and he might need a place."

147
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:33,521
And I thought,
"Well, that would be cool."

148
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:35,690
You know, I didn't really know him,

149
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,558
but I thought,
that would be interesting.

150
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,393
He seems like an interesting guy.
It would be cool.

151
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,163
I called Andy up, and he's like,
"Sure. I'm coming over."

152
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:47,510
Chris and Andy
had a very deep relationship.

153
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:49,971
I know that both of them had 4-tracks

154
00:07:50,438 --> 00:07:52,307
set up in their bedrooms,

155
00:07:52,774 --> 00:07:53,908
and they would each try
to record a song a day

156
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:56,594
and play it for the other guy.

157
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:58,663
He just had a freedom.

158
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,815
He didn't edit anything that he did,
anything that he wrote.

159
00:08:01,283 --> 00:08:03,685
He didn't care. He just charged
through the creative process

160
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,095
without a care in the world,
and I was the opposite,

161
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:07,355
over analyzing, and...

162
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,982
It was just
a really exciting creative time.

163
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:15,029
Thank you so much.

164
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:20,602
As long as I've known the guy,

165
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:22,170
there's always been different times

166
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,071
where he wasn't comfortable
with himself,

167
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,874
and his using drugs
was a product of that, too.

168
00:08:31,771 --> 00:08:33,406
If you know any addicts,
you know that, you know,

169
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:35,817
just because they quit
for three months doesn't mean shit,

170
00:08:36,318 --> 00:08:37,919
and he was someone who definitely had

171
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:39,520
a certain tragic flaw.

172
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,223
That's where his greatness came from.

173
00:08:44,993 --> 00:08:46,594
We knew that
he was trying to be sober,

174
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,863
and we knew that he was really...

175
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,898
That he couldn't just sustain...

176
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,059
You know, you can't just...

177
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:55,503
You can't...

178
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:57,739
You can't really be a junkie

179
00:08:58,173 --> 00:09:00,041
and be super-productive and, like...

180
00:09:00,508 --> 00:09:01,976
I mean, maybe somebody can,

181
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:04,746
but he wasn't going to be able
to do it.

182
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:09,083
That morning, like, March 19th, 1990,

183
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,987
there was, like,
five messages from Xana,

184
00:09:13,521 --> 00:09:15,156
Andy's girlfriend at the time,

185
00:09:15,565 --> 00:09:17,967
saying... You know, just hysterical.

186
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,132
We all got in a taxi

187
00:09:25,658 --> 00:09:27,260
and went up to Harbor view,

188
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,062
and he was on life support
at that point,

189
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:32,448
and it was a fucking trip.

190
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:35,276
I mean, it was, like,
the worst, most horrible...

191
00:09:38,546 --> 00:09:40,014
It was confusing, you know.

192
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:42,792
It was, like,
"Andy O.D.'ed and he's not dead,

193
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:46,963
"but he's not gonna live,
but he's not dead,

194
00:09:47,596 --> 00:09:49,131
"and you've got to come now."

195
00:09:49,515 --> 00:09:51,150
Whenever people would start
to get into drugs after that,

196
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,035
I'd always...
I always thought, like,

197
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:55,304
I wish I had a picture of Andy
when he was in the hospital,

198
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:58,040
because it was...
It was so horrible.

199
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:00,977
He was... They kept him alive
for a couple of days.

200
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:04,180
I think mostly just so
family and friends

201
00:10:04,614 --> 00:10:06,883
could say good-bye
or whatever, but...

202
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,152
It was... It was horrible.

203
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:11,988
It's difficult to articulate it,

204
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,159
but, it's...

205
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:19,870
You know, up to that point,

206
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:22,432
I think life was really good for us

207
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:25,326
As a... Just a group of musicians
in a scene,

208
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:28,830
making music.

209
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:31,399
It just... You know,
the world was sort of our oyster,

210
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:33,535
and we had support,
we supported each other.

211
00:10:33,935 --> 00:10:36,237
And he was kind of like
this beam of light

212
00:10:36,813 --> 00:10:37,981
sort of above it all,

213
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:40,675
and to see him hooked up to machines,

214
00:10:41,818 --> 00:10:44,220
that was the...
I think the death of the innocence

215
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:47,657
of the scene.

216
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:50,251
It wasn't later
when people surmised that...

217
00:10:50,826 --> 00:10:53,229
That Kurt blowing his head off
was the end of the innocence.

218
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:55,456
It didn't... It was that.

219
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:58,234
It was walking into that room.

220
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:10,997
So at this point, I think everyone

221
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:13,241
really wants to take a break,
for one,

222
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:15,426
and just kind of let things happen
naturally to a certain extent

223
00:11:15,851 --> 00:11:17,186
to see where we want to go with it,
you know.

224
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,688
We're not in any huge rush

225
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,848
to be rock stars at this point.

226
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:23,417
And Andy's attitudes and personality

227
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:26,346
were such an integral part
of Mother Love Bone

228
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:28,523
that, you know, there's just...

229
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:30,466
You wouldn't be able to replace him.

230
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:32,468
It’s just not,
in our minds at least, it just...

231
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:34,571
Fiddle with it.

232
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:37,164
What? You just lost all sound?

233
00:11:37,706 --> 00:11:38,641
Check.

234
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,277
Hello. Hello. Hello.

235
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:45,606
In  some ways, I was just thinking

236
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,741
about this
in the last couple of days,

237
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,077
that I can relate to
the Clippers and the Nets

238
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:52,955
because... I've kind of...

239
00:11:53,597 --> 00:11:55,999
I feel like my musical career
has kind of been that way,

240
00:11:56,892 --> 00:11:59,294
in that every time that it seems
like it's starting to take off,

241
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:03,291
somebody goes down with an injury

242
00:12:03,775 --> 00:12:06,144
or the coach gets fired
or something happens.

243
00:12:06,736 --> 00:12:08,571
I remember Jeff saying,

244
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,265
"Maybe I'm not supposed to
be doing this.

245
00:12:11,824 --> 00:12:13,493
"You know, that was my shot,
and it's gone."

246
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,378
I think if my dad and I hadn't had

247
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:17,213
such a contentious relationship
at that point,

248
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,682
I probably would have left Seattle.

249
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,842
I never felt like giving up.

250
00:12:22,251 --> 00:12:24,653
You know, I think I was writing
songs days later probably,

251
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:28,558
you know, playing my guitar
and still just going,

252
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,551
"I love playing my guitar."

253
00:12:30,926 --> 00:12:32,294
I ended up playing

254
00:12:32,636 --> 00:12:35,005
with a really good friend of mine
in town named Mike McCready.

255
00:12:38,935 --> 00:12:40,369
We got together,
and we started playing

256
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,596
in his parents' attic.

257
00:12:43,064 --> 00:12:45,166
That's when I had the conversation,

258
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:46,792
"We've got to get Jeff Ament
in the band."

259
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,302
Jeff was playing
with some other folks

260
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:50,146
and I think having a good time
doing that,

261
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,799
and my first instinct was like,
"I don't know."

262
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:54,734
I remember him just saying,
"Fuck Jeff Ament, "

263
00:12:55,076 --> 00:12:56,677
or something like that,
and I was kind of shocked.

264
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:58,312
Like, "Dude, that's your guy.

265
00:12:58,621 --> 00:13:00,122
"You've been with this guy forever."

266
00:13:00,497 --> 00:13:02,032
But Mike was like,
"No, you've got to."

267
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,685
And I was like, "Okay."

268
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,654
And then Jeff was there,
and I was like, "Yes."

269
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:09,540
We went in and did a demo

270
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,267
pretty quickly after that
with Matt Cameron.

271
00:13:11,634 --> 00:13:13,036
And I was like,
"What are you guys gonna do with it?"

272
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:15,788
And they were like, "We're
just trying to get a singer."

273
00:13:16,806 --> 00:13:18,641
I was working a security job
in San Diego.

274
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,468
I was just, like, writing music
in my living room

275
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,278
for the longest time, you know.

276
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:24,514
This instrumental tape,
it migrated to me,

277
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:27,383
then it really started
bringing out some emotions

278
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:29,077
that I hadn't touched on in a while.

279
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:31,421
It just...
this natural thing came out,

280
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:33,314
and all I did was record it.

281
00:13:33,656 --> 00:13:35,391
I surfed in P.B.
One morning after work

282
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:37,660
and went and recorded it,
like, literally

283
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:39,721
with the sand still on my feet
and stuff

284
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:42,523
and just sent it up that day.

285
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,163
This is where Jeff Ament...
His apartment was.

286
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,753
This is the place where I came over
after he called me

287
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,382
and said, "I got this demo from...
Back from Ed,

288
00:14:11,026 --> 00:14:12,361
"back from Eddie,

289
00:14:12,695 --> 00:14:14,330
"and you should come over
and check it out.

290
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:16,774
"It's good."

291
00:14:17,282 --> 00:14:19,551
It was a voice on a tape
that blew my mind.

292
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:22,522
It was kind of,
"Who is this? Is this real?"

293
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:24,732
I really remember thinking that,

294
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,443
like, "Is this a real guy?"

295
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:30,546
"Who is this guy?"

296
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:33,407
Here, in fact, is the Momma Son tape.

297
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:36,201
This is it, huh?

298
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,913
That is the tape.

299
00:14:40,264 --> 00:14:41,432
Crazy.

300
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:43,326
I remember listening to music.

301
00:14:43,726 --> 00:14:45,528
I remember thinking about his voice.

302
00:14:45,979 --> 00:14:47,881
I heard a person in there,
like a real person.

303
00:14:48,356 --> 00:14:50,624
I didn't hear a person trying
to sound like another person.

304
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:53,594
I heard a guy. I hadn't met him,

305
00:14:55,112 --> 00:14:56,113
but he's in there.

306
00:14:56,364 --> 00:14:57,799
And look it. It has...

307
00:14:58,157 --> 00:14:59,425
There's my phone number on it.

308
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:00,809
I'll call the number later

309
00:15:01,076 --> 00:15:03,479
and see if I can find a younger you.

310
00:15:04,496 --> 00:15:06,131
Tell him to be careful.

311
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,943
Hold on. Hold on, my friend.

312
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,780
Hi. I'm Eddie Vedder.

313
00:15:13,922 --> 00:15:16,325
In Seattle, I feel like
I'm kind of the new kid, and...

314
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:22,498
I'll be a new kid for a while.

315
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:26,735
We flew Ed up,
and we hung out for about a week

316
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,729
and worked on these songs

317
00:15:29,105 --> 00:15:30,973
in the basement of
Galleria Potato head.

318
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,042
It’s just nice to walk in that room,

319
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:35,310
and you smell raw materials,
you smell paint.

320
00:15:35,777 --> 00:15:37,379
There's this whole feeling of,
like, creativity.

321
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,948
You hear the pound of your footsteps

322
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,474
as you go down this basement,

323
00:15:40,782 --> 00:15:43,185
and you just go in and light it up.

324
00:15:45,162 --> 00:15:46,930
I remember right before he got
on the plane to come down,

325
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:49,007
he said, "When I get there,
I want you to pick me up,

326
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,851
"and I want to go straight
to the practice studio

327
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,478
"and I don't want to fuck around.

328
00:15:52,795 --> 00:15:54,397
"I just want to plug in
the instruments and get at it."

329
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:56,765
The music that sprouted
right off the bat

330
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,293
was pretty heartfelt and deep,
and before we knew it,

331
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:01,537
we all spent five days rehearsing.

332
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:04,373
The sixth day,
we played a fucking show.

333
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:08,410
We thought it was just insane
that we were playing a show

334
00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:11,380
after being together
for five or six days, yeah. Totally.

335
00:16:58,486 --> 00:17:00,087
Let's talk about the show
at The Moore.

336
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,890
The hidden Eddie Vedder.
Where was he?

337
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:05,860
He was frightened. He was terrified.

338
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,670
It was a bit hard for me
at the beginning,

339
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:18,914
coming up and being part

340
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,842
of a different place
and a different scene,

341
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:22,651
and it wasn't just a neutral zone.

342
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,413
It was their zone.

343
00:17:31,936 --> 00:17:33,337
He was really coming from
a different place

344
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:36,090
that I didn't...
I didn't fully understand.

345
00:17:36,732 --> 00:17:39,134
And I felt like he's good,

346
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:42,196
and then once I met him
and saw how personable he was

347
00:17:42,739 --> 00:17:45,141
and, like, excited and not fucked-up

348
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:48,136
and you know, just like a guy that

349
00:17:48,536 --> 00:17:49,503
we sent him music,

350
00:17:49,745 --> 00:17:51,180
and literally, like, two weeks later,
we had music back.

351
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:52,807
And that it wasn't Mother Love Bone.

352
00:17:53,124 --> 00:17:54,258
That was big.

353
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,910
You know, we had gotten a few tapes,

354
00:17:56,252 --> 00:17:57,419
and they were all, like,
Andy kind of tribute things,

355
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:00,114
and it was all like whoa...

356
00:18:01,507 --> 00:18:03,909
I think it took me years
to understand Eddie.

357
00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:10,041
My dad... He passed away

358
00:18:10,766 --> 00:18:12,835
before I knew he was my dad, right?

359
00:18:13,352 --> 00:18:15,120
So I grew up with this dad
I thought was my dad,

360
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,731
and then I found out later
that he wasn't

361
00:18:18,274 --> 00:18:20,410
and that the guy who was my dad

362
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:23,346
had already passed, like,
a few years earlier, man.

363
00:18:30,995 --> 00:18:32,129
There's only two chords to this song.

364
00:18:32,455 --> 00:18:34,824
It'll probably be really boring
on an acoustic.

365
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:37,827
You know, looking back,
I realize, like,

366
00:18:38,294 --> 00:18:40,263
we all got together in that room
at that time,

367
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:43,165
and you know,
I was still thinking about stuff

368
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:46,835
with, like,
my dad and loss and all that,

369
00:18:47,302 --> 00:18:49,138
and then
what they were thinking about,

370
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:52,008
having been through the situation
with Andy and everything, so...

371
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:54,443
In  ways we were strangers,

372
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,545
but we were coming from
a similar place.

373
00:18:56,979 --> 00:18:59,382
And all that kind of came out
in the first batch of songs.

374
00:19:11,827 --> 00:19:13,662
Release was kind of a drone jam

375
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:16,524
that we were messing around with
in the basement

376
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,634
the first week that Ed came up,

377
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:20,336
and it was one of those songs

378
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,205
that he just started singing
over the top of it,

379
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:24,991
and these words came out of him.

380
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:12,121
I remember the first time
that we played that song,

381
00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:14,073
right at the end of it, I remember

382
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,292
he sort of ran away
and ran around the corner.

383
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,736
I was thinking about my dad,

384
00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:21,631
and then afterward,
it got me all tore up,

385
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:25,643
and I went in the little hallway,

386
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:28,471
and then Jeff came out
and said, you know, "You okay?"

387
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:43,894
So this one here,

388
00:20:44,336 --> 00:20:46,705
this is, I don't know
if you've ever seen this.

389
00:20:47,297 --> 00:20:48,766
This is my dad.

390
00:20:49,134 --> 00:20:51,102
I met him a few times,

391
00:20:51,594 --> 00:20:53,997
but he was just, like, a friend
of the family or something.

392
00:20:55,347 --> 00:20:56,782
Edward Louis Severson lll.

393
00:20:57,141 --> 00:20:59,543
When I was born, that was my name.

394
00:21:00,602 --> 00:21:02,104
So he kind of...
He's up there for me.

395
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,615
Like, he's up in the ether somewhere.

396
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:07,518
I feel him sometimes.

397
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:34,747
The camaraderie and
the healthy competition part

398
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:37,642
I found later was unusual,

399
00:22:38,242 --> 00:22:39,543
and it was Johnny Ramone
that actually

400
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:41,604
pointed that out to me later,

401
00:22:42,037 --> 00:22:43,972
talking about, I think,
you know, the friendship

402
00:22:44,456 --> 00:22:46,125
you saw between Pearl Jam
and Soundgarden, for example,

403
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:47,876
and saying,
"I've never seen that before.

404
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,545
"New York wasn't like that.
We hate each other.

405
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:51,247
"We would screw each other up
at every turn.

406
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:53,091
"If you could, you would
mess the other band up."

407
00:22:53,466 --> 00:22:55,868
The best thing about it is,
I think, that...

408
00:22:57,595 --> 00:22:59,997
You learn from each other,
you know, and you...

409
00:23:00,597 --> 00:23:01,865
You're inspired by each other.

410
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:04,585
For me,
Temple of the Dog grew out of that.

411
00:23:07,814 --> 00:23:10,216
After Andy passed,
Chris (Cornell) just wrote these songs.

412
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:13,636
We were going to record it with,
you know,

413
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,472
the surviving members of
Mother Love Bone.

414
00:23:43,473 --> 00:23:45,709
It was a fun record
that no one had any expectations for,

415
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:47,803
so nobody worried about it,
and that made it

416
00:23:48,187 --> 00:23:50,255
feel very fresh
from beginning to end.

417
00:23:50,772 --> 00:23:52,207
For him to write songs

418
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:54,969
and then have the idea
of sharing those songs

419
00:23:55,986 --> 00:23:58,389
with Jeff and I was just, like,
another generous gesture

420
00:23:59,698 --> 00:24:01,800
that said, "I'm not only gonna
help you guys with this record,

421
00:24:02,326 --> 00:24:03,928
"but I'm gonna even ask
your new singer,

422
00:24:04,328 --> 00:24:06,063
"who he just is kind of
a shy, quiet guy,

423
00:24:06,497 --> 00:24:08,098
"because I haven't really
heard his voice yet.

424
00:24:08,498 --> 00:24:09,966
"I kind of saw you guys live,

425
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,736
"and you know, maybe he can sing.
I'm not sure."

426
00:24:21,512 --> 00:24:22,746
And then you hear it, and you go,

427
00:24:23,055 --> 00:24:25,458
"Our guy sings
really fucking good, too."

428
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:39,463
Eddie was very shy at the beginning.

429
00:24:39,988 --> 00:24:42,024
He was very kind of self-conscious.

430
00:24:42,533 --> 00:24:44,935
He's wasn't fully comfortable,
I think...

431
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:48,355
Until him and Cornell
went out one night.

432
00:25:13,105 --> 00:25:15,308
He really embraced Eddie
when he first moved up here,

433
00:25:15,858 --> 00:25:18,260
and sometimes I wonder
if that was a void that he felt

434
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:20,129
from Andy's passing,

435
00:25:20,487 --> 00:25:22,189
having another
equally talented singer

436
00:25:22,615 --> 00:25:24,083
that he could sort of
bounce ideas off of

437
00:25:24,491 --> 00:25:26,860
or just basically relate to.

438
00:25:28,496 --> 00:25:30,031
I know Eddie felt a real mentorship,

439
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:32,817
and I think that gave him
a lot of confidence.

440
00:25:49,308 --> 00:25:50,475
It was the first time

441
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:52,469
I ever heard myself on a real record.

442
00:25:52,895 --> 00:25:55,298
So it could be one of
my favorite songs that...

443
00:25:56,857 --> 00:25:59,259
That I've ever been on,
or the most meaningful.

444
00:26:32,267 --> 00:26:34,636
Where's Stone Gossard
when we need him?

445
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:37,631
Where is Stone? My God.

446
00:26:50,995 --> 00:26:53,397
We went up to Vancouver
to open for Alice in Chains.

447
00:26:57,876 --> 00:27:00,145
Played at this place called
The Town Pump.

448
00:27:00,712 --> 00:27:02,514
During the song Breath,

449
00:27:02,965 --> 00:27:05,368
security was taking out
some kid, some drunk guy.

450
00:27:13,308 --> 00:27:14,910
They were being overly aggressive.

451
00:27:15,311 --> 00:27:16,779
They were really taking this guy out,

452
00:27:17,146 --> 00:27:19,548
and Ed noticed that, was watching it.

453
00:27:21,817 --> 00:27:24,219
And you could just see
this change come over him.

454
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,132
This guy that had been shy,
that people didn't really know,

455
00:27:36,707 --> 00:27:38,442
he didn't know us, all of a sudden

456
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:40,811
his voice changes,
his attitude changes.

457
00:27:41,295 --> 00:27:43,698
It just got really intense.

458
00:27:50,888 --> 00:27:53,290
You got a problem.

459
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:09,290
Here we are in the studio.

460
00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:11,975
They're known as
Mookie Blaylock, but...

461
00:28:13,493 --> 00:28:15,295
Not anymore.
We had some legal problems.

462
00:28:15,746 --> 00:28:16,614
Yeah, the name was taken

463
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:18,866
by this guy named Mookie Blaylock.

464
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:21,377
Mookie Blaylock and Michael Jordan.

465
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:22,978
Look at that. They played yesterday.

466
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:25,656
The Bulls won, victorious.

467
00:28:28,383 --> 00:28:30,786
So the new name is Pearl Jam.

468
00:28:35,307 --> 00:28:37,710
We're not
gonna cultivate anything today.

469
00:29:05,046 --> 00:29:06,447
Okay. So Pearl Jam, the new name.

470
00:29:06,797 --> 00:29:08,899
And you guys have a lot
of other stuff going on,

471
00:29:09,425 --> 00:29:10,660
almost as we speak.

472
00:29:10,968 --> 00:29:12,402
Yeah. We're going in
the studio tomorrow

473
00:29:12,761 --> 00:29:15,164
to make our first album.

474
00:29:37,536 --> 00:29:39,305
I was selling merchandise
at that time,

475
00:29:39,747 --> 00:29:42,082
and you know, you can only take
so much stuff into Canada.

476
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:44,401
Everything we brought,
you know, I brought

477
00:29:44,835 --> 00:29:46,804
based on kind of what we'd been
selling up to that point.

478
00:29:47,296 --> 00:29:49,431
That night, before the opening band
was even done playing,

479
00:29:50,007 --> 00:29:52,376
I had sold out of everything,
stickers, T-shirts.

480
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,579
Anything that we brought across
was gone.

481
00:29:54,971 --> 00:29:56,339
I had nothing to do
for the rest of the night.

482
00:29:56,681 --> 00:29:59,083
So I grabbed my camera
and filmed the whole show.

483
00:30:00,351 --> 00:30:02,720
They were breaking.
Things were taking off.

484
00:30:10,402 --> 00:30:11,570
That's our CD.

485
00:30:11,862 --> 00:30:12,930
See, I hate holding up a CD.

486
00:30:13,197 --> 00:30:14,264
I want to hold up an album.

487
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:16,901
You can barely see this.

488
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,688
Our band is doing 10 times as well

489
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,064
as I ever thought we would.

490
00:30:55,322 --> 00:30:57,624
We're getting to play shows
almost every day.

491
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,603
You know, we're happy.

492
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,227
So the band's chemistry
seems really good right now.

493
00:31:08,752 --> 00:31:11,155
Yeah. Yeah. Very much a family.

494
00:31:16,636 --> 00:31:18,204
What is, you know, being
on the road, being touring,

495
00:31:18,596 --> 00:31:20,998
what is the strangest thing
that has happened to you?

496
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,211
Right here.

497
00:31:25,436 --> 00:31:26,637
I'd like to thank D'arcy
from the Smashing Pumpkins

498
00:31:26,937 --> 00:31:28,605
for letting me borrow her wardrobe.

499
00:31:29,022 --> 00:31:30,023
I think she looks a little better

500
00:31:30,273 --> 00:31:32,676
in it than you do, though.

501
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:38,457
We showed up in Zurich, Switzerland,

502
00:31:38,782 --> 00:31:41,185
and the venue was almost like
a kind of an art house.

503
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:44,696
The stage is, like, about as big
as our drum riser.

504
00:31:45,288 --> 00:31:46,556
We're like, "What are we gonna do?"

505
00:31:46,873 --> 00:31:47,941
We'd been playing enough
at that point

506
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,676
that we were kind of ready
to change something up.

507
00:31:50,043 --> 00:31:51,778
And we asked the local guys,
"Is there a chance

508
00:31:52,212 --> 00:31:53,413
"that you could get us
some acoustic instruments?

509
00:31:53,713 --> 00:31:55,649
"Maybe we could just do
kind of an acoustic show."

510
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:58,544
And we'd never done that before.

511
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:30,384
And then it was the next day,
somebody called

512
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,278
and asked about "MTV Unplugged."

513
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,138
So we said, "Yeah, we could do that."

514
00:32:34,505 --> 00:32:35,740
Yeah. We just did it. Yeah.

515
00:32:36,048 --> 00:32:38,417
Yeah.

516
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,223
It’s a true story,
something that I really felt

517
00:33:01,782 --> 00:33:04,184
and I still feel
every time I sing it.

518
00:33:16,171 --> 00:33:18,541
A lot of your songs
are sort of on the dark side.

519
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:21,034
Is there any reason for that,

520
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,446
or is that just mostly
what you see, or...

521
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:24,797
My emotions.

522
00:33:25,013 --> 00:33:26,515
It seems like I should be
even really happy right now.

523
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:28,292
You know, I get to, like, play shows.

524
00:33:28,642 --> 00:33:30,477
It’s been amazing, but the fact is,

525
00:33:30,936 --> 00:33:32,938
it's like my emotions are like
a quarter flipped in the air.

526
00:33:33,438 --> 00:33:35,707
It’s just like black and white,
you know, good and bad,

527
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:38,511
constantly, and you know,
maybe by talking

528
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,571
about things that may be
a little darker

529
00:33:40,946 --> 00:33:43,349
or more, you know, on the
negative side of our existence,

530
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,101
by dealing with them,

531
00:33:45,326 --> 00:33:47,728
maybe that's where
I find my happiness.

532
00:34:12,603 --> 00:34:13,637
The folks at MTV said

533
00:34:13,896 --> 00:34:15,631
they thought that was
one of the best "Unpluggeds."

534
00:34:16,065 --> 00:34:17,200
Is it nice
to get that kind of response,

535
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:18,750
especially when it's
a stripped-down...

536
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:20,335
I don't trust nobody,

537
00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:23,064
especially when they say
something good.

538
00:34:28,493 --> 00:34:30,896
If I even see you having fun,

539
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:37,194
you will be promptly arrested

540
00:34:38,546 --> 00:34:40,915
and led away.

541
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,919
Fuck security.

542
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:17,443
Yeah!

543
00:35:23,632 --> 00:35:26,035
That was when Ten
was completely blowing up.

544
00:35:26,636 --> 00:35:27,637
They played at 3:00 in the afternoon.

545
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:29,121
They were, like, the second group.

546
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:31,831
But the frenzy during their set
got more and more extreme

547
00:35:33,183 --> 00:35:35,585
as the tour went on.

548
00:35:40,107 --> 00:35:41,008
And it was all a whirlwind,

549
00:35:41,233 --> 00:35:42,935
because we went from vans
to playing little clubs

550
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:44,528
to a little bit bigger clubs,

551
00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:45,954
and then we get in "Lollapalooza, "

552
00:35:46,238 --> 00:35:48,540
and then you have everything blow up.

553
00:35:49,116 --> 00:35:50,184
I remember not being able to sleep

554
00:35:50,451 --> 00:35:51,752
for entire nights after the show

555
00:35:52,077 --> 00:35:53,579
because you'd be so buzzed.

556
00:35:53,954 --> 00:35:55,055
I finally figured out years later

557
00:35:55,331 --> 00:35:57,733
that if I took a bath,
that sometimes put me to sleep.

558
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:23,342
Is it like you can...

559
00:36:23,567 --> 00:36:25,369
Like you're just walking
down the street one day

560
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:27,687
and all of a sudden you feel like

561
00:36:28,197 --> 00:36:29,331
you're getting a lot more exposure

562
00:36:29,614 --> 00:36:31,082
by a lot more people
coming up to you?

563
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:33,852
Like, I'm just wondering, like,
when would you start noticing

564
00:36:35,162 --> 00:36:37,531
that all of a sudden, you know,
your millions,

565
00:36:38,123 --> 00:36:40,492
millions of people are, like...
Yeah, exactly.

566
00:36:41,084 --> 00:36:41,985
That would be weird.
That would be weird.

567
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:44,480
We try not to think about that
as much as we can.

568
00:36:45,047 --> 00:36:47,216
We try not to think about that
as much as we can.

569
00:36:47,758 --> 00:36:49,293
Think about that sentence
for a while, America.

570
00:36:49,677 --> 00:36:52,079
Think about it.

571
00:36:53,388 --> 00:36:54,756
Back on the "Headbangers Ball"

572
00:36:55,098 --> 00:36:57,034
with Eddie and Mike
of the band Pearl Jam.

573
00:36:57,518 --> 00:36:59,920
The album is called Ten.
Why is it called Ten?

574
00:37:01,146 --> 00:37:02,948
Actually, that's back to
Mookie Blaylock.

575
00:37:03,398 --> 00:37:05,634
That's his number.
It’s total dedication to Mookie.

576
00:37:06,193 --> 00:37:08,362
Now, we're about to play
your video for Alive.

577
00:37:08,904 --> 00:37:10,272
Did you like making the video, or...

578
00:37:10,614 --> 00:37:12,249
That was the thing.
We didn't make a video.

579
00:37:12,658 --> 00:37:14,660
We said we just wanted to play live.

580
00:37:15,161 --> 00:37:16,929
There's no way,
with a song like that,

581
00:37:17,371 --> 00:37:19,073
which talks about
living for the moment,

582
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:20,799
that we're going to, like,
lip-synch something

583
00:37:21,124 --> 00:37:22,459
that we had recorded
a few months ago.

584
00:37:22,793 --> 00:37:24,027
I wonder what they're going to
do for another video

585
00:37:24,336 --> 00:37:25,237
if we ever have to do one,

586
00:37:25,462 --> 00:37:26,663
because all we ever want to do
is live.

587
00:37:26,963 --> 00:37:28,265
Really? You can't see yourself

588
00:37:28,591 --> 00:37:30,960
ever making some sort of conceptual
video or anything like that?

589
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:34,121
Roll sound. Background.

590
00:38:03,876 --> 00:38:05,111
I personally have no problem

591
00:38:05,419 --> 00:38:06,920
with the theory of doing
a concept video at all.

592
00:38:07,296 --> 00:38:08,397
To me, it's more of a question

593
00:38:08,672 --> 00:38:09,973
of what you have more control over,

594
00:38:10,298 --> 00:38:11,666
and we're going to give
some control up this time

595
00:38:12,008 --> 00:38:14,411
and, you know, see how it works.

596
00:38:18,057 --> 00:38:19,959
That song was part of the second wave

597
00:38:20,434 --> 00:38:22,169
of songs that we wrote with Ed.

598
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:24,605
I still didn't really understand
songwriting at that point,

599
00:38:25,106 --> 00:38:26,374
and pretty much
that whole song is in A.

600
00:38:26,691 --> 00:38:28,993
There's not really, like, a real
major chord change in that song.

601
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:31,403
It sort of goes
against the rules of, like,

602
00:38:31,862 --> 00:38:33,597
how to write a pop song.

603
00:38:34,031 --> 00:38:35,499
Ed had been reading a newspaper

604
00:38:35,866 --> 00:38:37,334
when we were starting to
jam on the song

605
00:38:37,701 --> 00:38:38,802
and basically wrote the entire lyrics

606
00:38:39,077 --> 00:38:41,480
off of a newspaper article.

607
00:38:42,664 --> 00:38:44,866
Visually making that video
with Mark Pellington,

608
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:46,785
he did such a great job
at making you see

609
00:38:47,127 --> 00:38:49,329
kind of how heavy that lyric was.

610
00:38:49,879 --> 00:38:50,847
You seem
kind of embarrassed about it.

611
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:52,524
This seems to me to be quite a valid

612
00:38:52,883 --> 00:38:54,785
sort of artistic thing
to be doing up there.

613
00:38:55,261 --> 00:38:56,429
It was just... it’s a different...

614
00:38:56,721 --> 00:38:59,090
You know,
it's a different kind of focus.

615
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:01,266
You know, and that's the key to it,

616
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,268
is just focusing, you know,

617
00:39:03,686 --> 00:39:05,755
but kind of like, with a camera,

618
00:39:06,272 --> 00:39:08,674
that's just... You know,
I'm just not into it really.

619
00:39:56,947 --> 00:39:59,349
Yeah!

620
00:40:08,501 --> 00:40:10,903
We've never played
for this many people before.

621
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:15,240
We never thought we'd ever play
for this many people.

622
00:40:17,509 --> 00:40:19,911
So you ready for one more?
1, 2, 3, 4.

623
00:41:37,756 --> 00:41:39,491
Yeah, lots of times,

624
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:41,760
especially when our singer
starts climbing up on the ceiling,

625
00:41:42,219 --> 00:41:44,621
like, 50 feet above the stage,
and, like, is on a truss.

626
00:41:45,306 --> 00:41:47,708
You know, it's like, "Don't do that."

627
00:41:51,978 --> 00:41:53,146
Were you worried he'd fall down?

628
00:41:53,438 --> 00:41:54,639
All the time.

629
00:41:54,939 --> 00:41:56,541
I thought, "This guy's gonna
fall and kill himself,

630
00:41:56,942 --> 00:41:58,277
"and our career is over."

631
00:41:58,611 --> 00:42:01,013
I was worried every time he did it.

632
00:42:34,146 --> 00:42:35,581
Over the gigs,
it got higher and higher.

633
00:42:35,939 --> 00:42:37,207
You'd do one,
and then you'd notch it up,

634
00:42:37,524 --> 00:42:39,926
because you survived
the last one, so...

635
00:42:40,861 --> 00:42:42,630
We're gonna take this to some level

636
00:42:43,072 --> 00:42:44,473
that people aren't gonna forget,

637
00:42:44,823 --> 00:42:46,992
and if that means risking your life,

638
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:49,936
we're gonna do it.

639
00:42:57,962 --> 00:42:59,964
You know, we'd get to the hotel
after the shows or whatever

640
00:43:00,464 --> 00:43:01,698
and feel pretty good physically,

641
00:43:02,007 --> 00:43:04,143
and then I'd take a shower
and realize that I had, like,

642
00:43:04,677 --> 00:43:07,079
a thousand deep scratches on my back.

643
00:43:09,848 --> 00:43:11,516
I didn't want him to hurt himself.

644
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:14,336
But at the same time, it's like
there was no talking to him.

645
00:43:16,272 --> 00:43:18,674
He was going to do
what he was going to do.

646
00:43:20,151 --> 00:43:22,086
He could have killed himself
a couple of times probably

647
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:24,671
for sure, which would have been...

648
00:43:25,197 --> 00:43:27,599
More than I could have taken.

649
00:43:30,368 --> 00:43:31,703
Tell me. You look quite mixed up.

650
00:43:32,037 --> 00:43:34,073
Look at these pictures.
I'll show you these pictures.

651
00:43:34,582 --> 00:43:36,283
I'll show you why
I feel the way I do.

652
00:43:36,751 --> 00:43:38,052
It’s a little bit overwhelming

653
00:43:38,377 --> 00:43:39,611
to see this many people.

654
00:43:39,919 --> 00:43:42,322
I mean, I'm sure you've been
looking at this all day.

655
00:43:44,216 --> 00:43:46,452
It’s a lot of people.

656
00:43:47,011 --> 00:43:48,779
We're used to playing small clubs,
you know,

657
00:43:49,221 --> 00:43:51,624
and we want to go back
to playing small clubs.

658
00:43:53,351 --> 00:43:55,286
He wanted Pearl Jam to be a band

659
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:57,604
that goes out and tours in the van

660
00:43:58,063 --> 00:44:00,098
and pays its dues and plays clubs

661
00:44:00,607 --> 00:44:03,010
and makes albums and
has a slow, natural life.

662
00:44:04,944 --> 00:44:06,112
He was not the guy
that wanted to come out

663
00:44:06,404 --> 00:44:07,505
and have overnight success.

664
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:09,884
I think he was critical
about the mixes of Ten.

665
00:44:10,409 --> 00:44:12,811
He felt like maybe they were
leaning too commercial.

666
00:44:13,412 --> 00:44:15,814
He was really reluctant.

667
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:19,160
You are also not going to be

668
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:22,395
doing videos right away at least.

669
00:44:22,796 --> 00:44:23,964
We just don't know.

670
00:44:24,256 --> 00:44:25,591
You know,
our mind is on music right now,

671
00:44:25,924 --> 00:44:28,326
which is probably a really
good thing for everybody.

672
00:44:29,971 --> 00:44:31,939
I think I got that theory
to make that part work.

673
00:44:32,431 --> 00:44:34,834
I come in one earlier
than I normally do.

674
00:44:37,436 --> 00:44:39,205
So I still do four.
So it almost felt like it didn't...

675
00:44:39,647 --> 00:44:40,814
It almost kind of always felt like
I did

676
00:44:41,106 --> 00:44:42,341
one too many or something,

677
00:44:42,649 --> 00:44:43,850
but it didn't, like, play itself.

678
00:44:44,151 --> 00:44:46,554
Let's just do it one more time.

679
00:45:45,504 --> 00:45:47,639
A lot of my job
is taking what they bring

680
00:45:48,173 --> 00:45:50,142
and turning it into something.

681
00:45:50,634 --> 00:45:53,036
Okay, this is a chord change.
This is this. This is a melody.

682
00:45:54,054 --> 00:45:55,388
Okay, but what does that mean?

683
00:45:55,722 --> 00:45:58,125
Where am l?
If I close my eyes, where am I?

684
00:45:58,726 --> 00:46:01,128
What does this music mean?

685
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:12,806
Let's just figure out
where we want to go on that verse.

686
00:46:13,741 --> 00:46:15,976
I was at this, like,
small, little coffee shop,

687
00:46:16,534 --> 00:46:18,470
and someone came up and stopped me,

688
00:46:18,954 --> 00:46:20,088
and the waitress, this older lady,

689
00:46:20,372 --> 00:46:22,141
kind of witnessed it
and said, "You're..."

690
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:23,884
I said, "Yeah, yeah, " you know.

691
00:46:24,209 --> 00:46:25,810
She says, "What? You don't like it?"

692
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,445
I said, "it’s just...

693
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:29,055
"it’s no big deal, you know.
I'm just this guy."

694
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,482
And she says,
"If you don't like it, you know,

695
00:46:32,008 --> 00:46:34,111
"you certainly picked
the wrong business to be in."

696
00:46:34,637 --> 00:46:36,171
And she had a really good point.

697
00:46:36,554 --> 00:46:38,957
The fact is, when you sit
in your room playing guitar,

698
00:46:39,558 --> 00:46:40,893
you don't have to worry
about being successful.

699
00:46:41,227 --> 00:46:43,629
It's not gonna happen.
It's just not gonna happen.

700
00:46:45,355 --> 00:46:46,256
The point of doing an encore

701
00:46:46,482 --> 00:46:47,883
just doesn't make any sense to me.

702
00:46:48,233 --> 00:46:50,636
When you're playing
in front of 30 people...

703
00:46:53,238 --> 00:46:55,173
I had done the movie
"Say Anything..."

704
00:46:55,657 --> 00:46:58,060
and was anxious to do
the next movie here in Seattle,

705
00:46:59,203 --> 00:47:01,605
and it was going to have
that mix of music that I love.

706
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:06,068
The studio looked at the movie
and said,

707
00:47:06,418 --> 00:47:07,619
"We don't know
how to sell this movie.

708
00:47:07,919 --> 00:47:09,588
"We don't even want to put it out."

709
00:47:10,005 --> 00:47:12,407
But as Nirvana got bigger
and Pearl Jam got bigger,

710
00:47:13,633 --> 00:47:16,036
they came to me and said,
"Well, you know, there is one way."

711
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:19,664
When we looked at the schedule,

712
00:47:19,973 --> 00:47:21,808
it was like there was one day off
that week,

713
00:47:22,267 --> 00:47:23,769
and that was the day
that he wanted us to play,

714
00:47:24,144 --> 00:47:25,612
and we're just going like, "Shit."

715
00:47:25,979 --> 00:47:28,381
Any memories of
the "Singles" party in Los Angeles,

716
00:47:29,274 --> 00:47:30,876
which we have
very vivid footage from.

717
00:47:31,277 --> 00:47:33,679
God. Do you have
some footage of that?

718
00:47:34,363 --> 00:47:36,164
We do.
The unaired, of course, footage.

719
00:47:36,614 --> 00:47:39,017
Yeah. I won't watch that.

720
00:47:39,868 --> 00:47:42,270
Fuck MTV! Fuck all TV!

721
00:47:43,497 --> 00:47:44,732
It was pretty bad.

722
00:47:45,082 --> 00:47:46,250
We're all just warming up, you know.

723
00:47:46,542 --> 00:47:48,077
It’s not like one of these
fucking movie things.

724
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,862
You've got to warm up, right?

725
00:47:51,463 --> 00:47:52,931
It was a disaster,

726
00:47:53,298 --> 00:47:54,700
a total disaster.

727
00:47:55,092 --> 00:47:57,461
Everybody loves us.

728
00:47:58,219 --> 00:48:00,622
Everybody loves our town!

729
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:03,925
There were some long sound checks
that day or something.

730
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:05,911
So I drank, like, one bottle of wine,

731
00:48:06,312 --> 00:48:07,913
and then there was, like,
another that I opened

732
00:48:08,313 --> 00:48:10,716
to give to friends,
and they weren't drinking.

733
00:48:14,653 --> 00:48:15,721
And so we're downstairs,

734
00:48:15,988 --> 00:48:18,390
and there's a bottle of tequila
sitting down there,

735
00:48:19,533 --> 00:48:21,201
which we hardly ever drank
before the show,

736
00:48:21,618 --> 00:48:24,021
but by that point, we were already,
like, fucking wasted.

737
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:27,340
I actually have more memories

738
00:48:27,665 --> 00:48:30,068
than you'd think I would have.

739
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:33,988
The monitors
weren't working that well,

740
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,282
or my ears weren't working,
one or the other.

741
00:48:36,758 --> 00:48:38,827
I kept looking over and
asking them to turn the monitors up.

742
00:48:39,344 --> 00:48:41,313
I can't hear anything.
And it just wouldn't turn up.

743
00:48:41,805 --> 00:48:43,807
At some point after a while,
I just got really upset,

744
00:48:44,308 --> 00:48:46,543
and I went over.
They had this pipe and drape thing,

745
00:48:47,102 --> 00:48:48,370
and I pulled it off
and threw it down or something.

746
00:48:48,687 --> 00:48:49,855
I don't know. Is this documented?

747
00:48:50,147 --> 00:48:52,383
I looked over,
and that wasn't our sound woman.

748
00:48:52,942 --> 00:48:54,843
It was the lighting person.
I kept wondering, like,

749
00:48:55,318 --> 00:48:57,721
"Why is it getting brighter in here?"

750
00:49:06,747 --> 00:49:09,149
I began to see studio executives
and their families

751
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,534
starting to stream for the exits.

752
00:49:11,918 --> 00:49:13,086
Some fights were breaking out.

753
00:49:13,378 --> 00:49:15,781
Don't be violent!
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

754
00:49:31,563 --> 00:49:32,798
Because we had waited so long

755
00:49:33,107 --> 00:49:34,275
for anyone to ask us to do something

756
00:49:34,567 --> 00:49:36,468
that we were saying yes, yes, yes.

757
00:49:36,943 --> 00:49:39,346
That was a moment where
it was really evident

758
00:49:40,072 --> 00:49:41,273
that there was always gonna be

759
00:49:41,573 --> 00:49:43,976
one more thing they were
gonna want you to do.

760
00:49:48,413 --> 00:49:50,716
At some point, you had to say no.

761
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:53,694
That was the birth of no.

762
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:26,392
Let's keep things rolling here, Tab.

763
00:50:26,993 --> 00:50:29,029
"Grunge rockers Pearl Jam."

764
00:50:29,538 --> 00:50:30,539
We don't have time
to explain the puzzle to you,

765
00:50:30,789 --> 00:50:33,191
but we'll be back.

766
00:50:43,218 --> 00:50:45,387
Shit got fucking crazy.

767
00:50:45,929 --> 00:50:47,063
- Who are Pearl Jam?
- Right.

768
00:50:47,347 --> 00:50:49,249
This is MTV's "Smells Like Grunge"
countdown.

769
00:50:49,724 --> 00:50:50,592
I was just screaming for anything.

770
00:50:50,809 --> 00:50:51,776
I wanted something of Eddie's.

771
00:50:52,018 --> 00:50:53,887
And they gave me the wine bottle.

772
00:50:54,354 --> 00:50:55,388
What did you think of the show?

773
00:50:55,647 --> 00:50:56,915
It was fucking so awesome.

774
00:50:57,232 --> 00:50:58,233
Could you do a Week in Rock
open for us?

775
00:50:58,483 --> 00:50:59,685
What is that?

776
00:50:59,985 --> 00:51:02,253
We're just about to launch
MTV in Latin America.

777
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,122
I don't know if you feel comfortable

778
00:51:04,448 --> 00:51:05,716
doing a couple of l.D.'s for us...

779
00:51:06,033 --> 00:51:06,967
- Sure.
- Sure.

780
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,602
In  Spanish. So if you
could just hang on. Josh.

781
00:51:10,995 --> 00:51:12,330
Pearl Jam.

782
00:51:12,664 --> 00:51:15,066
MTV.

783
00:51:15,959 --> 00:51:17,460
What do you think grunge means?

784
00:51:17,835 --> 00:51:19,070
I don't even say that word.

785
00:51:19,379 --> 00:51:20,413
Really?

786
00:51:20,672 --> 00:51:23,075
All your friends are
talking about is Pearl Jam.

787
00:51:24,384 --> 00:51:26,086
Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam.
Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam.

788
00:51:26,512 --> 00:51:28,547
I've always hated their band.

789
00:51:29,055 --> 00:51:30,757
The first Pearl Jam
record came out two months

790
00:51:31,183 --> 00:51:33,318
before the Nevermind record,
so it turned into

791
00:51:33,852 --> 00:51:35,287
a Pearl Jam versus Nirvana thing.

792
00:51:35,645 --> 00:51:36,880
Nirvana's Kurt Cobain made

793
00:51:37,189 --> 00:51:39,458
some rather disparaging remarks
about Pearl Jam's music,

794
00:51:40,025 --> 00:51:41,226
which he thought was too commercial

795
00:51:41,527 --> 00:51:43,395
to be truly alternative.

796
00:51:43,862 --> 00:51:46,265
I was so naive and fresh
when we first came out,

797
00:51:47,074 --> 00:51:49,443
singing and opening up,
and then everyone

798
00:51:50,035 --> 00:51:52,337
just looked at it
from a cynical point of view

799
00:51:52,913 --> 00:51:55,315
or started copying it.

800
00:51:56,208 --> 00:51:58,610
Eddie Vedder joins
Creed front man Scott Stapp.

801
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:08,144
Eddie Vedder is attempting

802
00:52:08,428 --> 00:52:10,831
to rip out Scott Stapp's larynx
with his bare hands.

803
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,308
The group is called Pearl Jam.

804
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,634
I'm talking about Pearl Jam.

805
00:52:14,893 --> 00:52:16,128
Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam.

806
00:52:16,437 --> 00:52:18,005
Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam.
Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam.

807
00:52:18,397 --> 00:52:20,799
Pearl Jam...

808
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:25,145
Hi. I'm Tabitha Soren
with "MTV News."

809
00:52:25,612 --> 00:52:27,981
Pearl Jam will become the second
Seattle band within a month

810
00:52:28,573 --> 00:52:30,075
to enter
the Billboard pop albums chart

811
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:31,651
at number one next week.

812
00:52:31,952 --> 00:52:33,287
Since its release a week ago,

813
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,989
Vs. has sold 950,000 copies.

814
00:52:36,623 --> 00:52:38,625
A million.
You know, what's a million?

815
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:41,528
I'm having a hard enough time
with one right now.

816
00:52:42,922 --> 00:52:44,290
We played "Saturday Night Live"
the second time,

817
00:52:44,632 --> 00:52:45,833
and I remember
talking to Stone the next day,

818
00:52:46,133 --> 00:52:47,067
and he said, "What did you
think of Daughter?"

819
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,702
And I thought in my mind,
we played Daughter?

820
00:52:51,304 --> 00:52:53,707
So I essentially blacked out on TV.

821
00:52:57,644 --> 00:52:59,246
And that's how I dealt with
how big we got,

822
00:52:59,647 --> 00:53:01,916
kind of checking out
and partying a lot.

823
00:53:02,483 --> 00:53:04,284
I bought into the myth,

824
00:53:04,734 --> 00:53:06,336
and it was killing me.

825
00:53:06,737 --> 00:53:07,771
The last time I talked to Kurt,

826
00:53:08,029 --> 00:53:10,265
we both agreed together
that we were not

827
00:53:10,824 --> 00:53:12,159
going to participate in
the Time Magazine.

828
00:53:12,493 --> 00:53:13,961
Neither band was going to participate

829
00:53:14,328 --> 00:53:16,530
in the Time Magazine interview,
and we didn't,

830
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,482
and then they put me
on the fucking cover anyway.

831
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:21,368
I mean, sure, I could read it,

832
00:53:21,668 --> 00:53:22,869
you know, and I read it.
I read it on the airplanes.

833
00:53:23,169 --> 00:53:24,237
But I don't take it seriously.

834
00:53:24,504 --> 00:53:25,438
If I want to find out anything,

835
00:53:25,672 --> 00:53:26,807
I'm not gonna read Time Magazine.

836
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:28,625
Time Magazine was just, you know,

837
00:53:29,009 --> 00:53:30,076
your parents' magazine

838
00:53:30,343 --> 00:53:31,912
or the magazine
that's in a doctor's office,

839
00:53:32,304 --> 00:53:33,238
and I just thought,

840
00:53:33,472 --> 00:53:35,874
"We've been swallowed up
by the mainstream,

841
00:53:36,683 --> 00:53:38,118
"and no one's gonna want to
listen to us."

842
00:53:38,477 --> 00:53:39,611
I'm not gonna read Newsweek.

843
00:53:39,894 --> 00:53:41,129
I'm not gonna read
any of these magazines.

844
00:53:41,438 --> 00:53:42,973
I mean, 'cause they've just got
too much to lose

845
00:53:43,357 --> 00:53:45,759
by printing the truth.

846
00:53:48,194 --> 00:53:50,597
You know that.

847
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:06,441
How were you going to survive
and not do something wrong,

848
00:56:08,377 --> 00:56:09,845
not piss someone off?

849
00:56:10,212 --> 00:56:11,880
You know, now you've sold
too many records,

850
00:56:12,297 --> 00:56:14,633
but these people are so happy
to hear your music,

851
00:56:15,217 --> 00:56:16,952
but these people hate you now.

852
00:56:17,385 --> 00:56:19,788
And... And these people
love you so much

853
00:56:20,848 --> 00:56:22,983
they want to kill you.

854
00:56:23,517 --> 00:56:25,619
So how do you relate to
any of these people

855
00:56:26,144 --> 00:56:28,547
from where you are?

856
00:56:29,398 --> 00:56:31,600
Yeah, I think the one that
I wanted to get impersonal with

857
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:34,552
was No Code
because of stalker problems

858
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:36,738
and built a wall
in front of the house

859
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,432
because... Because why?

860
00:56:40,659 --> 00:56:43,061
Because I had been open
and honest and intimate in lyrics,

861
00:56:45,705 --> 00:56:48,107
that seemed really strange.

862
00:56:48,792 --> 00:56:51,161
Now I'm having to build a wall
in front of the house.

863
00:56:52,922 --> 00:56:55,324
I mean, that wall...
It saved my life.

864
00:56:57,759 --> 00:56:59,594
Not because of privacy
or anything, but literally,

865
00:57:00,053 --> 00:57:02,456
because someone drove,
trying to drive into the house

866
00:57:03,932 --> 00:57:06,335
at 50 miles an hour.

867
00:57:08,603 --> 00:57:11,006
So, you wonder what happened

868
00:57:12,899 --> 00:57:15,302
or how did it mutate into
this kind of situation?

869
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:19,973
You'll have to edit this part.

870
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:25,261
The young musician
who made grunge music popular

871
00:57:25,787 --> 00:57:27,389
had become an overnight spokesman

872
00:57:27,789 --> 00:57:29,391
for many disaffected young Americans,

873
00:57:29,792 --> 00:57:31,927
as his fans tried to sort out
what it was

874
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,662
that caused him to take his life.

875
00:57:35,213 --> 00:57:36,348
I was trying to, like, with my eyes

876
00:57:36,632 --> 00:57:39,034
trying to tell them, "Don't hurt me."

877
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:41,753
And what's all this nonsense

878
00:57:42,012 --> 00:57:43,747
about how terrible life is?

879
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:46,483
A young girl who stood outside
his home in Seattle

880
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:49,294
with tears
streaming down her face said,

881
00:57:49,853 --> 00:57:52,222
"it’s hard to be
a young person nowadays.

882
00:57:52,814 --> 00:57:55,217
"He helped open people's eyes
to our struggles."

883
00:57:56,359 --> 00:57:58,561
Please wipe the tears
from your eyes, dear.

884
00:57:59,111 --> 00:58:00,446
You're breaking my heart.

885
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,982
I'd love to relieve
the pain you're going through

886
00:58:03,533 --> 00:58:05,936
by switching my age for yours.

887
00:58:09,581 --> 00:58:10,448
I was trying to call him

888
00:58:10,665 --> 00:58:11,699
because I'd read something he said,

889
00:58:11,958 --> 00:58:13,527
that he couldn't keep it real,

890
00:58:13,919 --> 00:58:15,086
and I just wanted
to tell him, "Listen,

891
00:58:15,378 --> 00:58:16,379
"you don't have to do anything

892
00:58:16,629 --> 00:58:17,664
"anybody fucking tells you to do.

893
00:58:17,923 --> 00:58:20,025
"Just stop fucking playing,
cancel all your shit,

894
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:21,618
"and don't do anything."

895
00:58:21,885 --> 00:58:23,620
I had a whole thing
I was going to tell him,

896
00:58:24,054 --> 00:58:26,356
but I never got a chance.

897
00:58:26,931 --> 00:58:29,000
Sometimes people elevate you,
you know,

898
00:58:29,518 --> 00:58:31,920
whether you like it or not.

899
00:58:32,979 --> 00:58:35,382
It's real easy to fall.

900
00:58:37,109 --> 00:58:39,511
I don't think any of us would be
in this room here tonight

901
00:58:40,611 --> 00:58:43,014
if it weren't for Kurt Cobain, so...

902
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:50,772
People think that we're whining
or crying about success

903
00:58:52,374 --> 00:58:53,642
if we're just really trying
to tell you

904
00:58:53,959 --> 00:58:56,161
that there's some intense pressures

905
00:58:56,711 --> 00:58:59,113
and really some things
that could be helped.

906
00:59:17,899 --> 00:59:19,267
He resonates in my life

907
00:59:19,609 --> 00:59:22,012
in this... It always comes up,
like, around a campfire

908
00:59:23,196 --> 00:59:25,598
or playing music with a few guys
he had known in a garage

909
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,352
for no particular reason.

910
00:59:29,828 --> 00:59:32,197
I always just think,
"He would have...

911
00:59:33,081 --> 00:59:35,483
"He would have liked this."

912
00:59:49,014 --> 00:59:49,981
I really like him.

913
00:59:50,223 --> 00:59:52,225
I think he's a nice,
really nice person.

914
00:59:52,725 --> 00:59:54,027
I didn't like him a lot then,

915
00:59:54,353 --> 00:59:56,522
when I was talking shit
about him all the time,

916
00:59:57,064 --> 00:59:59,466
but now I can...
I can appreciate him, you know.

917
01:00:00,066 --> 01:00:01,668
I mean, I've realized that, you know,

918
01:00:02,069 --> 01:00:03,503
the same people that like
our band like their band,

919
01:00:03,861 --> 01:00:06,264
so why create some kind
of feud over something?

920
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,941
He made us think about
everything that we did, you know.

921
01:00:17,416 --> 01:00:19,018
His critique of us early on

922
01:00:19,419 --> 01:00:21,655
sure kept us on good behavior.

923
01:00:22,214 --> 01:00:23,448
In  terms of everything that we did,

924
01:00:23,756 --> 01:00:25,525
we thought,
"Okay, why are we doing this?"

925
01:00:25,968 --> 01:00:27,402
If we're good now,

926
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,163
it's partly because of him.

927
01:00:37,729 --> 01:00:39,331
It's not like you're friends
or anything.

928
01:00:39,731 --> 01:00:41,266
I mean, I can consider him

929
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:42,851
a person that I really like.

930
01:00:43,151 --> 01:00:44,485
I mean, we've had a few
conversations on the phone,

931
01:00:44,819 --> 01:00:45,720
and I really like him.

932
01:00:45,945 --> 01:00:48,348
I think he's a nice,
really nice person.

933
01:00:50,659 --> 01:00:51,927
Yeah, I remember
the sound of his voice,

934
01:00:52,244 --> 01:00:54,379
but I don't remember
what we talked about.

935
01:00:54,913 --> 01:00:57,316
Just normal stuff.
It was just real...

936
01:00:59,084 --> 01:01:01,486
Just real normal.

937
01:01:21,606 --> 01:01:22,807
I haven't let myself change,

938
01:01:23,149 --> 01:01:25,385
but the way people see you changes,

939
01:01:25,944 --> 01:01:28,280
and that's not in my hands,
that's not in my control.

940
01:01:28,864 --> 01:01:30,298
And maybe what is in my control

941
01:01:30,656 --> 01:01:32,959
is not doing interviews,
or not being on the TV,

942
01:01:33,535 --> 01:01:35,937
and not anything to kind of
glorify your face or position.

943
01:01:41,835 --> 01:01:43,837
I was talking about this band
being a bit more faceless,

944
01:01:44,338 --> 01:01:45,806
and it can be done, you know.

945
01:01:46,173 --> 01:01:48,175
Pink Floyd and...

946
01:01:48,675 --> 01:01:51,077
I mean, it can be done.

947
01:01:53,846 --> 01:01:56,249
Ed couldn't be anonymous,
and it was affecting him.

948
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:58,418
So I think psychologically,

949
01:01:58,685 --> 01:02:01,087
he needed to take control
of something.

950
01:02:04,024 --> 01:02:06,393
So then he was like, "Okay.
I can have control over music."

951
01:02:13,741 --> 01:02:16,144
I felt that anything that we put out
was highly representative of me,

952
01:02:18,496 --> 01:02:20,898
because I was kind of becoming
the most recognizable guy.

953
01:02:34,929 --> 01:02:36,097
Vitalogy was the first record

954
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:38,525
where it was like we were making
a record in a different way.

955
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:39,960
I was writing a few songs,

956
01:02:40,185 --> 01:02:41,453
but all of a sudden
everybody was starting to write,

957
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:43,104
and he was writing more,
and I was like,

958
01:02:43,438 --> 01:02:44,906
"Wait a minute, you know.
I'm the guy.

959
01:02:45,273 --> 01:02:47,209
"You know, let me get in there
and do this thing.

960
01:02:47,693 --> 01:02:50,095
"I know how to do this thing."

961
01:02:50,695 --> 01:02:53,097
And at the time I thought,
"This isn't our best record."

962
01:02:54,658 --> 01:02:56,994
The dynamics of the band
of how they have changed

963
01:02:57,578 --> 01:02:59,813
to who was "in power, "

964
01:03:00,371 --> 01:03:02,640
Stone early on,

965
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:05,610
Ed now.

966
01:03:43,665 --> 01:03:45,166
As much as I'm excited to play,

967
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:47,343
I'll cop to it, it's a surfing tour.

968
01:03:47,835 --> 01:03:49,704
I plan on having a surfboard
with me at all times.

969
01:03:50,171 --> 01:03:51,305
That was a big worldwide tour.

970
01:03:51,589 --> 01:03:53,758
I think it was the first time
we went to Australia.

971
01:03:54,343 --> 01:03:56,478
It was a challenging time,
to kind of go,

972
01:03:57,011 --> 01:03:58,279
"I don't know if we're
the same band right now,

973
01:03:58,596 --> 01:04:00,398
"but we might be a different band
right now,

974
01:04:00,849 --> 01:04:03,251
"and maybe
they'll like the new band."

975
01:04:18,158 --> 01:04:20,560
Jeff and I have always had
this adversarial relationship.

976
01:04:21,453 --> 01:04:22,321
It’s all been muted now

977
01:04:22,538 --> 01:04:24,273
because what we thought of
as our new band

978
01:04:24,706 --> 01:04:26,140
that we might try to control together

979
01:04:26,499 --> 01:04:28,768
immediately was taken over by Ed.

980
01:04:29,335 --> 01:04:30,870
But we learned
the greatest lesson of all,

981
01:04:31,254 --> 01:04:33,590
which is just as you're fighting
over the scraps of control,

982
01:04:34,174 --> 01:04:35,942
you meet somebody
with so much artistic energy

983
01:04:36,384 --> 01:04:38,787
that your argument becomes pointless.

984
01:05:05,914 --> 01:05:07,649
We were always kind of
going towards something else.

985
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:09,418
I think we wanted to be
more like Zeppelin.

986
01:05:09,751 --> 01:05:11,886
I think we wanted to be more
of a chameleon type of band.

987
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:14,823
We didn't want to be locked into,
like, a real specific style.

988
01:05:16,008 --> 01:05:17,409
But the business aspect
of the record company,

989
01:05:17,759 --> 01:05:18,960
it's all about
fucking making money now

990
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:21,129
and fucking wind this thing up,
and you know,

991
01:05:21,596 --> 01:05:23,097
they could care less
if it's gone tomorrow

992
01:05:23,473 --> 01:05:25,175
because they've got something
coming up the fucking backside

993
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,734
that's gonna replace it.

994
01:05:27,018 --> 01:05:28,720
And we were just trying to figure out

995
01:05:29,145 --> 01:05:31,047
how we were gonna be a band
down the road, you know.

996
01:05:31,523 --> 01:05:33,592
Like, there wasn't anybody to
go to at that point, you know,

997
01:05:34,109 --> 01:05:36,511
not until we met Neil.

998
01:05:38,989 --> 01:05:39,890
The first time we got asked

999
01:05:40,115 --> 01:05:41,583
to play The Bridge School
in San Francisco,

1000
01:05:41,991 --> 01:05:43,226
we just made a connection there.

1001
01:05:43,535 --> 01:05:44,436
He said,
"Hey, man, thanks for doing this."

1002
01:05:44,661 --> 01:05:47,030
And a few months later,
he asked us to go to Europe with him.

1003
01:05:48,289 --> 01:05:50,692
Like, it all seems like...
All seems like a dream to me.

1004
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:03,471
Doing a record with him,
we did Mirror Ball,

1005
01:06:03,846 --> 01:06:06,215
it was so educational, listening
to him talk about his career.

1006
01:06:07,225 --> 01:06:08,993
Playing in stadiums one minute,

1007
01:06:09,435 --> 01:06:10,737
and then the next time
he's playing in clubs,

1008
01:06:11,063 --> 01:06:12,631
and then he's playing
in medium-sized places,

1009
01:06:13,023 --> 01:06:15,392
but all along, he's doing
whatever he wants to do.

1010
01:06:16,025 --> 01:06:18,428
His point is to kind of
roll with the punches.

1011
01:06:52,813 --> 01:06:55,215
I'm happy to finally have
an adult in my life

1012
01:06:57,066 --> 01:06:58,501
that leads by example.

1013
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:01,262
I've had some crazy adults
in my life.

1014
01:07:02,071 --> 01:07:04,474
So it's about time I got one
that inspires me.

1015
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:23,743
I hope Neil’s feeling feisty tonight,

1016
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:28,131
and speaking of feisty,

1017
01:07:28,431 --> 01:07:30,833
some smart-ass
who arranged the tables

1018
01:07:31,768 --> 01:07:34,171
put our table right next to
Ticketmaster's table over here.

1019
01:07:41,028 --> 01:07:43,430
So I predict a food fight
by the end of the evening,

1020
01:07:46,533 --> 01:07:48,935
and I would recommend
to the classy people over there

1021
01:07:49,578 --> 01:07:51,246
to scoot away or join in.

1022
01:07:51,663 --> 01:07:54,066
Maybe we should all join in
while we got them right here.

1023
01:07:59,379 --> 01:08:00,814
In  the United States,
the hit rock band Pearl Jam

1024
01:08:01,173 --> 01:08:03,575
has taken battle against
what it claims

1025
01:08:04,175 --> 01:08:06,144
is the greed of
the entertainment industry.

1026
01:08:06,636 --> 01:08:08,104
It’s tackling the high cost of buying

1027
01:08:08,471 --> 01:08:10,873
from the country's biggest
ticket agency, Ticketmaster.

1028
01:08:11,516 --> 01:08:13,918
All the band wants, it says,
is a fair deal for the fans.

1029
01:08:17,855 --> 01:08:19,824
We don't want
to be doing a press conference.

1030
01:08:20,316 --> 01:08:21,584
We want to be playing.

1031
01:08:21,901 --> 01:08:24,137
The nation's top rock band
is accusing

1032
01:08:24,696 --> 01:08:26,197
the biggest ticket distributor
in the business

1033
01:08:26,573 --> 01:08:28,642
of unfair practices
and price-gouging.

1034
01:08:29,159 --> 01:08:31,561
If they don't agree to Ticketmaster's
terms, they can't perform.

1035
01:08:32,495 --> 01:08:34,898
A spokesman insisted
Ticketmaster never told

1036
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:37,208
any promoter not to book Pearl Jam.

1037
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:40,028
He dismissed the band members as,

1038
01:08:43,465 --> 01:08:45,333
Last month, the band took
the extraordinary step

1039
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,203
of filing a complaint here
at the justice department.

1040
01:08:51,014 --> 01:08:53,416
When you're on that big of a stage,
it's not in your control.

1041
01:08:54,059 --> 01:08:55,594
You're sort of playing a part
to some larger drama.

1042
01:08:55,978 --> 01:08:58,380
We had a very specific problem
with Ticketmaster,

1043
01:08:59,398 --> 01:09:00,666
and they asked us to come and testify

1044
01:09:00,983 --> 01:09:01,850
about our specific problem

1045
01:09:02,066 --> 01:09:04,035
in regards to a larger lawsuit
that was being brought,

1046
01:09:04,528 --> 01:09:06,063
but it's always been
perceived as, like,

1047
01:09:06,446 --> 01:09:08,114
we were trying to
break up Ticketmaster.

1048
01:09:08,531 --> 01:09:10,800
The subcommittee will come to order.

1049
01:09:11,368 --> 01:09:12,936
We are honored
to have representatives

1050
01:09:13,328 --> 01:09:15,731
of both Pearl Jam and
Ticketmaster here with us today.

1051
01:09:17,415 --> 01:09:19,818
The key question is whether
recent contractual agreements

1052
01:09:20,585 --> 01:09:22,520
between Ticketmaster
and most major stadiums

1053
01:09:23,004 --> 01:09:25,407
and concert promoters have violated
federal antitrust laws.

1054
01:09:27,675 --> 01:09:30,078
Who would like to go first? Stone?

1055
01:09:31,429 --> 01:09:33,098
All the members of Pearl Jam
remember what it's like

1056
01:09:33,515 --> 01:09:35,550
to be young
and not have a lot of money.

1057
01:09:36,059 --> 01:09:37,294
Many Pearl Jam fans are teenagers

1058
01:09:37,602 --> 01:09:39,237
who do not have the money
to pay $30 or more

1059
01:09:39,646 --> 01:09:41,915
that is often charged
for tickets today.

1060
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:43,583
We have made a conscious decision

1061
01:09:43,859 --> 01:09:45,093
that we do not want to put
the price of our concerts

1062
01:09:45,401 --> 01:09:46,669
out of the reach of our fans.

1063
01:09:46,986 --> 01:09:48,488
Mr. Chairman,
this is really about choices.

1064
01:09:48,864 --> 01:09:50,465
Fans can go from one music store
to another

1065
01:09:50,865 --> 01:09:52,467
to find the best deal on a CD,

1066
01:09:52,867 --> 01:09:54,335
but they can't go anywhere
but Ticketmaster

1067
01:09:54,702 --> 01:09:55,836
for concert tickets.

1068
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,523
Do you think Ticketmaster
is entitled to a profit?

1069
01:09:59,582 --> 01:10:01,984
I don't think
that question matters, you know.

1070
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:05,822
You do have a contract
with your record company,

1071
01:10:06,422 --> 01:10:08,391
and it is exclusive. Is that correct?

1072
01:10:08,884 --> 01:10:10,352
I think this line
of questioning is very strange,

1073
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:13,121
because it seems like what does that
really have to do with anything?

1074
01:10:13,889 --> 01:10:15,624
The issue at hand here
is whether Ticketmaster

1075
01:10:16,057 --> 01:10:17,792
is a monopoly, not whether...

1076
01:10:18,226 --> 01:10:19,427
Or to have anything to do with
our business

1077
01:10:19,727 --> 01:10:21,128
or what our relationship is
with our manager.

1078
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:23,089
Let's just get it on the record.

1079
01:10:23,481 --> 01:10:24,749
- Mr. Horn.
- Now I gather...

1080
01:10:25,066 --> 01:10:27,468
Do you want these guys
to play Long Beach or not?

1081
01:10:28,445 --> 01:10:30,847
What I want is a record.

1082
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:35,143
What I want is a record here.

1083
01:10:36,327 --> 01:10:38,296
Let's just get it on the record.

1084
01:10:38,789 --> 01:10:41,191
A record here.

1085
01:10:44,502 --> 01:10:46,904
First of all, I want you to know
I think you're just darling guys.

1086
01:10:48,965 --> 01:10:50,300
This is so great.

1087
01:10:50,634 --> 01:10:51,968
When we got involved in this issue,

1088
01:10:52,301 --> 01:10:54,704
I did not know very much, and still
don't, about alternative music.

1089
01:10:56,806 --> 01:10:59,208
After some requests, I tried to learn
some Pearl Jam songs,

1090
01:11:00,644 --> 01:11:03,046
but I think it's a little beyond me.

1091
01:11:05,022 --> 01:11:07,224
Having been a fan
for many, many years,

1092
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,676
I don't want to become

1093
01:11:08,901 --> 01:11:10,837
something that I despised
as a kid, you know.

1094
01:11:11,321 --> 01:11:13,723
When my staff told me
we were going to have this hearing,

1095
01:11:14,657 --> 01:11:16,359
I have to tell you,
I knew nothing about grunge,

1096
01:11:16,785 --> 01:11:19,187
but I know a lot about the importance
of fairness and equity,

1097
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:23,441
and I think you've raised
some very important questions.

1098
01:11:25,292 --> 01:11:27,161
Who were the powers-that-be
that wanted to be perceived

1099
01:11:27,629 --> 01:11:28,897
as putting some pressure
on Ticketmaster?

1100
01:11:29,214 --> 01:11:31,616
It’s like, you know,
those are back-room,

1101
01:11:32,384 --> 01:11:34,286
David Lynch-ian guys in hotel rooms

1102
01:11:34,761 --> 01:11:37,163
who need oxygen tanks, darkened L.A.

1103
01:11:38,974 --> 01:11:40,442
That's who I always think of.

1104
01:11:40,809 --> 01:11:43,211
It’s like, he understands.

1105
01:11:45,312 --> 01:11:47,281
Almost a year after picking
its fight with Ticketmaster,

1106
01:11:47,774 --> 01:11:50,176
Pearl Jam remains alone
among major rock bands

1107
01:11:50,944 --> 01:11:52,712
who could have joined
the Seattle group in its boycott

1108
01:11:53,154 --> 01:11:54,189
but never did.

1109
01:11:54,447 --> 01:11:56,249
It’s just a few lonely voices

1110
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,835
because not many
of the other groups joined up.

1111
01:11:59,369 --> 01:12:00,971
There's no deal
between us and Ticketmaster.

1112
01:12:01,371 --> 01:12:03,773
We're not playing
Ticketmaster shows this summer.

1113
01:12:18,637 --> 01:12:20,406
Shows where we're going
outside of cities

1114
01:12:20,849 --> 01:12:23,185
and building shows
from the ground up,

1115
01:12:23,769 --> 01:12:26,171
that was a really tough time.

1116
01:12:52,755 --> 01:12:54,858
We're trying to find how many
counterfeit tickets are out there.

1117
01:12:55,384 --> 01:12:57,152
We saw some people selling tickets.

1118
01:12:57,594 --> 01:12:58,929
So we bought them.
We were all psyched.

1119
01:12:59,262 --> 01:13:01,430
And then we got up to the door,
and they said they were counterfeit.

1120
01:13:01,972 --> 01:13:03,040
Right now,
we're trying to figure out

1121
01:13:03,307 --> 01:13:05,710
how to help these kids
get into the show.

1122
01:13:18,781 --> 01:13:21,184
Let me just leave you
with this observation.

1123
01:13:21,992 --> 01:13:23,728
When art is successful,

1124
01:13:24,162 --> 01:13:26,564
it unavoidably becomes a business.

1125
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:28,850
The question then is

1126
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:31,486
whether artists have
an inherent right

1127
01:13:32,045 --> 01:13:34,247
to control the limits
of their business

1128
01:13:34,797 --> 01:13:37,033
and how it relates to
the growth of their art.

1129
01:13:37,592 --> 01:13:39,861
The answer, I'm convinced,

1130
01:13:40,429 --> 01:13:42,831
is that artists do have
a right to that control.

1131
01:13:45,475 --> 01:13:47,343
I think we've always
just fallen into ways

1132
01:13:47,810 --> 01:13:50,213
of doing things the way
we felt they should be done,

1133
01:13:51,314 --> 01:13:53,183
and whether they were right
or whether they were wrong,

1134
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:56,052
they were just our ways of doing it.

1135
01:13:58,362 --> 01:14:00,064
I've never heard of Pearl Jam,
I must admit.

1136
01:14:00,490 --> 01:14:02,892
That makes two of us.

1137
01:14:04,452 --> 01:14:06,754
And here we are in your fine place.

1138
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:09,566
And what are the things
that you've kept

1139
01:14:10,125 --> 01:14:12,527
that remind you of the experience
the last 20 years with the band?

1140
01:14:13,127 --> 01:14:15,529
I'm sure I've kept the least amount
of things of anyone in the band.

1141
01:14:17,131 --> 01:14:18,733
How I've always justified that is,

1142
01:14:19,134 --> 01:14:20,869
one, I lose everything all the time.

1143
01:14:21,302 --> 01:14:23,070
So it comes naturally to me.

1144
01:14:23,512 --> 01:14:25,915
And two, Jeff Ament keeps so much,

1145
01:14:27,517 --> 01:14:29,919
and really, if all I have to do
is just maintain

1146
01:14:31,604 --> 01:14:33,273
my good relationship with Jeff Ament,

1147
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:34,991
I can always go over to his house

1148
01:14:35,316 --> 01:14:37,351
and look through
all the stuff that he has,

1149
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:40,263
and celebrate
his keeping of the things.

1150
01:14:43,116 --> 01:14:45,518
Pearl Jam in Mexico City

1151
01:14:47,996 --> 01:14:50,398
memorial... These are some
of the Mexico City coffee cups.

1152
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,302
So that's a...
it’s a little faded now.

1153
01:14:54,877 --> 01:14:57,279
Because you use it.

1154
01:15:00,466 --> 01:15:02,869
This one clearly needs to go
back in the dishwasher.

1155
01:15:03,511 --> 01:15:04,746
Here's something.

1156
01:15:05,055 --> 01:15:06,623
Mike McCready just sent me this.

1157
01:15:07,056 --> 01:15:09,425
It’s the demos from
Temple of the Dog.

1158
01:15:14,230 --> 01:15:15,565
I've got a few...

1159
01:15:15,899 --> 01:15:18,301
This is a box full of Pearl Jam
"Touring Band" DVDs.

1160
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:22,939
And that's 2000.

1161
01:15:23,406 --> 01:15:25,141
I don't know why they're still there.

1162
01:15:25,575 --> 01:15:26,776
I haven't... I'm not sure...

1163
01:15:27,076 --> 01:15:29,078
And a few Pearl Jam CD’s here,

1164
01:15:29,579 --> 01:15:31,581
the kind of stuff probably
I had someone bring by

1165
01:15:32,081 --> 01:15:34,484
because I was trying to remember
how to play some songs.

1166
01:15:36,419 --> 01:15:38,822
I don't know if there's anything else
in here.

1167
01:15:39,797 --> 01:15:42,199
Let's see here.
Yep, that might be it.

1168
01:15:44,594 --> 01:15:46,997
There might be something
in the basement.

1169
01:15:49,599 --> 01:15:52,002
Look it. There's a Grammy.

1170
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:56,172
I knew this was gonna come in handy.

1171
01:16:20,171 --> 01:16:22,573
You can tell how I feel
about the Grammys.

1172
01:16:29,972 --> 01:16:30,973
You know, at the Grammys,

1173
01:16:31,224 --> 01:16:32,993
I was having kind of a bad day.

1174
01:16:33,435 --> 01:16:34,536
I was getting thrown out
by security people

1175
01:16:34,811 --> 01:16:36,012
for trying to sneak a cigarette
in the backstage,

1176
01:16:36,312 --> 01:16:38,714
and you couldn't go out because
of all the photographers there.

1177
01:16:39,315 --> 01:16:40,283
So that was part of it.

1178
01:16:40,525 --> 01:16:42,927
Spin the Black Circle, Pearl Jam.

1179
01:16:46,322 --> 01:16:47,490
I hate to start off with a bang.

1180
01:16:47,782 --> 01:16:49,116
I'm gonna say something typically me

1181
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:51,085
on behalf of all of us.
I don't know what this means.

1182
01:16:51,494 --> 01:16:53,897
I don't think it means anything.

1183
01:16:57,667 --> 01:17:00,069
That's just how I feel.

1184
01:17:09,721 --> 01:17:11,289
I remember arguing with
tons of my friends,

1185
01:17:11,722 --> 01:17:12,890
because my friends were like,

1186
01:17:13,182 --> 01:17:14,417
"Man, what the fuck
was your boy doing?

1187
01:17:14,726 --> 01:17:15,827
"Like, if he doesn't want
to be there,

1188
01:17:16,102 --> 01:17:17,503
"then he shouldn't be there, "
and kind of all this stuff.

1189
01:17:17,854 --> 01:17:19,055
And I was kind of like,
"Fuck you, man."

1190
01:17:19,355 --> 01:17:20,890
Like, what does it mean, you know?

1191
01:17:21,274 --> 01:17:22,208
Like, are you fucking kidding me?

1192
01:17:22,441 --> 01:17:24,844
You get an award for art?
Like, that's just ridiculous.

1193
01:17:28,072 --> 01:17:30,441
Like, if I would have had the balls,
I would have said the same thing.

1194
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:40,276
I should have started a fight
right there.

1195
01:17:40,751 --> 01:17:43,120
It would have been
much more exciting.

1196
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,795
What would all these young people
be doing

1197
01:17:51,304 --> 01:17:53,707
if they had real problems
like a depression or Vietnam?

1198
01:17:55,225 --> 01:17:56,192
Do they work at all?

1199
01:17:56,434 --> 01:17:57,636
Are they contributing anything

1200
01:17:57,936 --> 01:18:00,338
to the world
they're taking so much from?

1201
01:18:20,416 --> 01:18:22,185
It was kind of around
the Ticketmaster tour.

1202
01:18:22,627 --> 01:18:25,029
The four of us, Jack, Stone,
Jeff, and I were traveling in a jet.

1203
01:18:27,674 --> 01:18:29,976
Eddie was traveling in a van,
doing a radio show,

1204
01:18:30,551 --> 01:18:32,954
and then driving all night
to the next show.

1205
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:35,849
So there was
a huge physical disconnect,

1206
01:18:36,266 --> 01:18:37,667
but also an emotional one.

1207
01:18:38,017 --> 01:18:39,819
And nobody was
kind of really talking.

1208
01:18:40,270 --> 01:18:41,938
He was trying to maintain something

1209
01:18:42,355 --> 01:18:44,757
that was more a Fugazi or
do-it-yourself type mentality.

1210
01:18:47,276 --> 01:18:49,679
You know, and we loved them,
but we weren't that band.

1211
01:18:52,615 --> 01:18:54,384
We needed to sit down
with him and go, "Look,

1212
01:18:54,826 --> 01:18:56,427
"are you embarrassed by us?

1213
01:18:56,827 --> 01:18:59,230
"Do you want to be
in the band anymore?"

1214
01:19:00,499 --> 01:19:02,601
We thought we were
going to break up essentially.

1215
01:19:03,126 --> 01:19:05,528
I thought... I thought
that was going to happen.

1216
01:19:10,634 --> 01:19:13,036
And we all agreed we needed to
take some time off and figure it out.

1217
01:19:18,182 --> 01:19:20,318
That's highway 200,
and we're like right...

1218
01:19:20,852 --> 01:19:22,954
We just passed Ovando.

1219
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,415
We're headed towards Lincoln.

1220
01:19:25,899 --> 01:19:27,467
And then we just keep going
to the northeast.

1221
01:19:27,859 --> 01:19:29,961
That's the spot right there,
Big Sandy.

1222
01:19:30,486 --> 01:19:32,655
That's your hometown?

1223
01:19:33,197 --> 01:19:35,599
This is the middle of nowhere, man.

1224
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:43,925
I was sort of pissed off
at my parents

1225
01:19:44,334 --> 01:19:46,736
for making me live in
this desolate...

1226
01:19:47,795 --> 01:19:49,664
I mean, I was hundreds of miles away

1227
01:19:50,131 --> 01:19:52,533
from anybody
that I could even relate to.

1228
01:19:57,597 --> 01:19:58,865
I was ready to leave at about 14.

1229
01:19:59,182 --> 01:20:00,249
A couple trips to California,

1230
01:20:00,516 --> 01:20:02,919
like, really fucked me up.

1231
01:20:06,064 --> 01:20:07,666
My mom's brother, my uncle Pat,

1232
01:20:08,066 --> 01:20:09,334
he had long hair,

1233
01:20:09,651 --> 01:20:11,719
and he had tapestries up in his room,

1234
01:20:12,236 --> 01:20:13,571
and he'd put the headphones on me,

1235
01:20:13,905 --> 01:20:15,507
and he'd play, like,
Abraxas by Santana,

1236
01:20:15,907 --> 01:20:18,309
and it would just blow my mind.

1237
01:20:20,829 --> 01:20:23,231
I remember just getting, like,
a huge buzz off of it, like,

1238
01:20:23,915 --> 01:20:26,317
and getting, like, kind of emotional.

1239
01:20:30,796 --> 01:20:32,231
And I would go out
and try to look for records.

1240
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:34,959
It was really hard to find. There was
no record store in our town.

1241
01:20:35,551 --> 01:20:37,453
So I started subscribing to
Circus and Cream magazine,

1242
01:20:37,929 --> 01:20:39,798
and my uncle got
Rolling Stone magazine.

1243
01:20:40,265 --> 01:20:42,667
And I mean, you'd study that stuff.

1244
01:20:45,311 --> 01:20:47,714
In  a lot of those punk-rock records,
you could really hear bass, you know.

1245
01:20:48,315 --> 01:20:49,916
You could fucking hear Dee Dee
on those Ramones records.

1246
01:20:50,316 --> 01:20:52,185
You know, he was on the right side,
and Johnny was on the left side.

1247
01:20:52,652 --> 01:20:53,586
So if you were trying
to learn the songs,

1248
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:55,655
you could just turn the dial over
to the right side

1249
01:20:56,114 --> 01:20:58,516
and learn all of Dee Dee's parts.

1250
01:21:02,036 --> 01:21:03,538
I moved to Seattle in 1983,

1251
01:21:03,913 --> 01:21:05,714
and I think all I wanted to do
up to that point

1252
01:21:06,165 --> 01:21:07,166
was to live in a bigger city

1253
01:21:07,416 --> 01:21:09,719
where there was
more like-minded people

1254
01:21:10,295 --> 01:21:12,697
and more culture
and a punk-rock show,

1255
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:14,908
if I wanted to go see a cool movie.

1256
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,468
There were all these...
You know, "Eraserhead."

1257
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,028
I was hearing about all these movies

1258
01:21:18,386 --> 01:21:20,755
that I never got a chance to see.

1259
01:21:24,976 --> 01:21:27,111
I don't know if it was
the first contact, it must have been,

1260
01:21:27,645 --> 01:21:29,948
was from Jeff,

1261
01:21:30,565 --> 01:21:32,934
and I do remember there being a...

1262
01:21:33,985 --> 01:21:35,753
A real connection made on the phone,

1263
01:21:36,195 --> 01:21:38,598
and talking about artwork,
how he was into artwork,

1264
01:21:39,823 --> 01:21:41,725
and your responsibilities
as a band member

1265
01:21:42,201 --> 01:21:44,604
or working with people that get
that it's not a slacker job,

1266
01:21:46,247 --> 01:21:48,616
or it's not a rock star thing,
or it's not...

1267
01:21:49,751 --> 01:21:51,252
it’s about music. it’s about art.

1268
01:21:51,627 --> 01:21:53,429
It’s about...
We had all these things in common,

1269
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,282
which is probably why
we ended up roommates

1270
01:21:57,633 --> 01:21:59,101
when we first started touring.

1271
01:21:59,468 --> 01:22:01,871
I think that we just connected
and became really close.

1272
01:22:12,231 --> 01:22:14,634
It’s amazing now to look back.

1273
01:22:26,830 --> 01:22:28,531
I remember when
Ed first came to town.

1274
01:22:28,956 --> 01:22:29,891
It seemed like it was something

1275
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:32,127
that he had been kind of
waiting for his whole life,

1276
01:22:32,627 --> 01:22:34,028
and it was obvious
within the first few minutes

1277
01:22:34,378 --> 01:22:36,780
that it was something that
I'd been waiting for also.

1278
01:22:55,357 --> 01:22:56,726
I think it would be a very easy band

1279
01:22:57,068 --> 01:22:58,736
in some ways for us not to be a band,

1280
01:22:59,153 --> 01:23:01,055
and nobody can really kind of
put a finger on what it is

1281
01:23:01,531 --> 01:23:03,566
that, you know, kind of keeps us
coming back together,

1282
01:23:04,075 --> 01:23:06,478
but it's a strange marriage.

1283
01:23:19,298 --> 01:23:21,700
I met Mike McCready
when I was in seventh grade.

1284
01:23:22,677 --> 01:23:24,679
He was good.
You know, he played solos

1285
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:27,148
and had a whammy bar and, like,
could do the...

1286
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:28,608
And all this stuff.

1287
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:30,218
I had lived in Los Angeles,

1288
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,595
trying to make it in my band
Shadow in 1986 for a year,

1289
01:23:33,103 --> 01:23:34,838
and I paid to play,
paid to play at The Roxy,

1290
01:23:35,272 --> 01:23:37,675
$700 on a Sunday night in December.
And there was five people there.

1291
01:23:43,615 --> 01:23:45,483
So I struggled and went through that,

1292
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:47,886
and I gave up
playing music for a little while,

1293
01:23:48,370 --> 01:23:50,772
moved back to Seattle and said,
"I can't. I'm done."

1294
01:23:52,331 --> 01:23:54,734
And then, lo and behold, I get
a call out of the blue from Stone.

1295
01:23:55,418 --> 01:23:56,852
I got to see him play at a party
one night

1296
01:23:57,253 --> 01:23:58,587
when he was just sitting around

1297
01:23:58,921 --> 01:24:00,256
and playing lead guitar with somebody

1298
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:02,959
and was just, in the way
that he does, unconsciously,

1299
01:24:03,551 --> 01:24:05,953
giving you these jolts.

1300
01:24:30,786 --> 01:24:32,955
He's channeling stuff
that sounds like

1301
01:24:33,497 --> 01:24:35,099
it's coming from the fucking heavens,

1302
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,102
but I think it's coming from inside.

1303
01:24:37,502 --> 01:24:39,904
There's something spiritual
about the way he plays.

1304
01:24:46,218 --> 01:24:48,621
And that's when he's in tune
with the good stuff, you know.

1305
01:25:01,358 --> 01:25:03,761
As you know, the song Reach Down,
which was the second song I wrote

1306
01:25:04,528 --> 01:25:05,963
for the Temple of the Dog record,

1307
01:25:06,322 --> 01:25:08,724
I wanted it to be sort of like
a Neil Young,

1308
01:25:10,201 --> 01:25:11,135
"Fuck you to the world of people

1309
01:25:11,368 --> 01:25:12,403
"who don't want to hear
a guitar solo.

1310
01:25:12,662 --> 01:25:15,064
"I'm gonna make an 1 1 or 1 2-minute
song that's mostly guitar solo,

1311
01:25:15,832 --> 01:25:16,933
"and that's gonna be
the first song on the album,

1312
01:25:17,208 --> 01:25:18,342
"and you can fuck off."

1313
01:25:18,626 --> 01:25:20,161
When I heard Cready play guitar,

1314
01:25:20,545 --> 01:25:22,247
I was like,
"We're gonna pull it off for real.

1315
01:25:22,672 --> 01:25:24,273
"This isn't gonna be a joke.
He can actually fucking play."

1316
01:25:24,673 --> 01:25:25,741
Because I couldn't.

1317
01:25:26,008 --> 01:25:28,143
He went out of his mind.

1318
01:25:28,677 --> 01:25:31,080
This guy's a...
he's a fucking rock star.

1319
01:25:32,015 --> 01:25:33,349
Like, he's got problems,

1320
01:25:33,682 --> 01:25:35,718
and we just thought
he was a nice little kid.

1321
01:25:36,227 --> 01:25:38,629
And he's got something in there,
like, he's infected,

1322
01:25:39,688 --> 01:25:42,091
and that's gonna come out
again somewhere. Good luck, guys.

1323
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,228
He knows me. That's...

1324
01:25:45,695 --> 01:25:48,097
I would say that's 100 accurate.

1325
01:26:08,426 --> 01:26:10,695
Eddie said,
"Ask Mike about the drummers."

1326
01:26:11,262 --> 01:26:12,430
Ask me about the drummers?

1327
01:26:12,763 --> 01:26:15,132
Yeah. He says, "Mike will
give you the drummers rap."

1328
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:19,529
Here we go.

1329
01:26:20,021 --> 01:26:21,789
We started out with Dave Krusen.
It didn't work out.

1330
01:26:22,231 --> 01:26:24,000
Matt Chamberlain,
he didn't want to go on the road.

1331
01:26:24,442 --> 01:26:25,443
He knew of a drummer
named Dave Abbruzzese.

1332
01:26:25,693 --> 01:26:28,095
It’s very Spinal Tap of us
to have this many drummers.

1333
01:26:29,447 --> 01:26:30,414
Jack lrons.

1334
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,824
- Good drummer.
- Great look. Good drummer.

1335
01:26:32,116 --> 01:26:34,485
Jack was the guy that gave the tape
that he got from Stone to Ed.

1336
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,321
Ed wanted to repay that favor

1337
01:26:36,621 --> 01:26:38,089
and say, "Hey,
you want to come and try out?"

1338
01:26:38,456 --> 01:26:40,191
And we toured with him
after we did Yield,

1339
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:41,593
and he played on that whole record.

1340
01:26:41,835 --> 01:26:43,937
That's when it was starting to
get too much for Jack.

1341
01:26:44,462 --> 01:26:45,963
He called up
and said that he couldn't tour.

1342
01:26:46,338 --> 01:26:47,273
We already had a tour booked.

1343
01:26:47,507 --> 01:26:49,909
Who can we call that can do that?
Matt Cameron.

1344
01:26:52,136 --> 01:26:53,471
Soundgarden had broken up,
so Ed called him.

1345
01:26:53,805 --> 01:26:54,873
Eddie, what's going on?

1346
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:56,341
And he's like, "Hey,
what are you doing this summer?"

1347
01:26:56,641 --> 01:26:57,709
Nothing.

1348
01:26:57,976 --> 01:26:59,444
We need to leave in three weeks.

1349
01:26:59,811 --> 01:27:02,213
- In  10 days, he learned 80 songs.
- They had a list of, like, 60 or 70.

1350
01:27:02,813 --> 01:27:03,747
Something crazy like that.

1351
01:27:03,981 --> 01:27:05,450
I would just sort of, like,
close my eyes,

1352
01:27:05,817 --> 01:27:07,018
and I'd go like that,
and it was like,

1353
01:27:07,318 --> 01:27:09,720
"Okay, do I know that song?"
it’s like, "No!"

1354
01:27:10,696 --> 01:27:13,099
Matt Cameron made us
a better band than we've ever been.

1355
01:27:19,956 --> 01:27:21,591
When we'd... We'd have to switch,

1356
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,601
let's say, a drummer or something,

1357
01:27:24,001 --> 01:27:25,336
you do it out of survival mode.

1358
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:27,405
It’s just like removing an organ.

1359
01:27:27,838 --> 01:27:29,440
And when you remove,
like, the drummer,

1360
01:27:29,841 --> 01:27:31,476
you're removing, like, the heart.

1361
01:27:31,885 --> 01:27:34,287
So it's like
you had a heart transplant.

1362
01:27:51,528 --> 01:27:53,797
Binaural is a dark time for me
for sure,

1363
01:27:54,365 --> 01:27:55,700
because I had my Crohn's.
I have Crohn's disease.

1364
01:27:56,033 --> 01:27:57,234
I was struggling with that,

1365
01:27:57,535 --> 01:27:59,137
struggling with addiction.

1366
01:27:59,537 --> 01:28:01,806
I was taking pills
to take care of that,

1367
01:28:02,373 --> 01:28:04,108
and then that got out of hand.

1368
01:28:04,542 --> 01:28:06,944
For me, it was a struggle, for sure.

1369
01:28:10,381 --> 01:28:12,050
In  the early years,
we had those transcendent shows

1370
01:28:12,467 --> 01:28:14,268
where it was just like
everybody was drunk,

1371
01:28:14,718 --> 01:28:16,587
and it was just
the "lose your mind" shows.

1372
01:28:17,055 --> 01:28:18,390
Everybody lose your mind
at once, you know.

1373
01:28:18,723 --> 01:28:20,257
It was harder to lose your mind
at that point

1374
01:28:20,641 --> 01:28:22,844
because everyone was more like,
"I'm 32.

1375
01:28:23,436 --> 01:28:25,405
"You know,
we've got some records out.

1376
01:28:25,897 --> 01:28:27,899
"I've got this relationship,
or you know..."

1377
01:28:28,441 --> 01:28:29,609
We just became more self-conscious

1378
01:28:29,942 --> 01:28:32,244
and more aware as you do
as you're an adult,

1379
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:34,889
but it's more difficult
to kind of go, "Okay.

1380
01:28:35,448 --> 01:28:37,817
"We got to just go out
and get crazy."

1381
01:28:40,245 --> 01:28:42,113
And around this time,
I think we were...

1382
01:28:42,622 --> 01:28:44,190
You know, we were less popular.

1383
01:28:44,623 --> 01:28:46,191
I don't think
we were doing any press.

1384
01:28:46,626 --> 01:28:47,927
We'd have meetings
about those things.

1385
01:28:48,252 --> 01:28:50,154
It’s like, "How far are we
gonna do press on this tour?

1386
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:51,965
"Are we gonna do this?
Are we gonna do that?

1387
01:28:52,298 --> 01:28:53,732
"Or are we not going to
do any of it?"

1388
01:28:54,091 --> 01:28:56,494
And when you don't do any of it
and the changing times,

1389
01:28:57,095 --> 01:28:59,497
you know, you fluctuate,
people get over you, you know.

1390
01:29:00,097 --> 01:29:02,366
That's probably around that time
Binaural is.

1391
01:29:02,933 --> 01:29:04,835
Maybe people were like, "Okay.
We're kind of over these guys.

1392
01:29:05,311 --> 01:29:07,680
"What's next?" you know.

1393
01:29:13,652 --> 01:29:15,621
But some people stayed with us

1394
01:29:16,113 --> 01:29:18,515
because we stayed true
to whatever our vision was.

1395
01:29:25,706 --> 01:29:28,109
How important
is commercial success to you?

1396
01:29:29,752 --> 01:29:32,154
Does grunge still exist today?

1397
01:29:49,647 --> 01:29:52,049
How did the second 10 years happen?

1398
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:55,862
You did survive.

1399
01:29:56,362 --> 01:29:58,764
And what are the turning points
to you?

1400
01:30:01,533 --> 01:30:03,402
Change your position. Moving back.

1401
01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:06,272
We still have a problem here.

1402
01:30:06,872 --> 01:30:09,175
It’s one of Europe's
worst concert tragedies.

1403
01:30:09,751 --> 01:30:11,019
The band had stopped playing
just before the incident.

1404
01:30:11,336 --> 01:30:13,738
Deadly trouble in the shape of
a crowd 40,000 to 50,000 strong.

1405
01:30:16,257 --> 01:30:18,659
There has been a lot
of pushing and pressure up here,

1406
01:30:19,385 --> 01:30:21,788
and 10 to 15 people
have been badly hurt.

1407
01:30:22,722 --> 01:30:24,457
We don't know how bad yet.

1408
01:30:24,891 --> 01:30:26,592
Tragedy occurred in the rain and mud

1409
01:30:27,017 --> 01:30:29,420
late Friday night at the annual
"Roskilde Rock Festival"

1410
01:30:30,730 --> 01:30:32,565
outside the Danish capital,
Copenhagen,

1411
01:30:33,023 --> 01:30:35,426
when rock fans surged forward
during a performance

1412
01:30:36,736 --> 01:30:39,138
by the American group Pearl Jam.

1413
01:30:45,536 --> 01:30:47,038
Fans at the outdoor rock concert

1414
01:30:47,413 --> 01:30:48,781
packed closer and closer
to the stage,

1415
01:30:49,123 --> 01:30:51,525
ending in a crush that killed
nine people and injured three more.

1416
01:30:57,381 --> 01:30:59,784
I just wanted to get out of there.

1417
01:31:00,802 --> 01:31:03,171
I just didn't want it to be true.

1418
01:31:04,638 --> 01:31:05,773
It was happening
right in front of us,

1419
01:31:06,057 --> 01:31:08,459
but I just didn't want it to be true.

1420
01:31:16,401 --> 01:31:18,803
And something as horrific
and as shocking

1421
01:31:21,072 --> 01:31:22,440
as people being pulled
over the barricade

1422
01:31:22,782 --> 01:31:24,083
that aren't alive anymore,

1423
01:31:24,408 --> 01:31:26,810
what the impact of that was on us

1424
01:31:27,537 --> 01:31:29,939
is, you know,
it will never really go away.

1425
01:31:31,416 --> 01:31:33,818
From that point on,
we rethought everything.

1426
01:31:43,093 --> 01:31:44,461
I didn't know what I was feeling,
you know.

1427
01:31:44,803 --> 01:31:47,206
I think I had such an onslaught
of confusion that...

1428
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:50,885
I mean,
the last time that I felt like that

1429
01:31:51,268 --> 01:31:52,636
was when Andy Wood died, and...

1430
01:31:52,978 --> 01:31:55,381
I didn't know if I wanted
to play music anymore.

1431
01:32:23,843 --> 01:32:25,945
You know, I think we kind of quantify
everything that's happened to us

1432
01:32:26,471 --> 01:32:28,873
as pre "Roskilde"
and after "Roskilde, " and...

1433
01:32:32,852 --> 01:32:35,254
You know, if early on there was
the birth or the beginning of "No, "

1434
01:32:37,689 --> 01:32:40,092
for us Roskilde was
the beginning of "What?"

1435
01:32:42,111 --> 01:32:43,746
What are we doing?

1436
01:32:44,154 --> 01:32:46,557
What do we do to assist the families?

1437
01:32:47,742 --> 01:32:49,310
And what have we become?

1438
01:32:49,702 --> 01:32:52,104
And what do we...
What do we do to survive?

1439
01:32:56,042 --> 01:32:58,444
I think even since Roskilde in 2000,

1440
01:33:00,171 --> 01:33:02,573
I think that made everybody get
into a real unique perspective

1441
01:33:04,383 --> 01:33:06,785
on where we were at
and how fragile life is,

1442
01:33:08,304 --> 01:33:09,705
and I think ever since then,
every once in a while,

1443
01:33:10,056 --> 01:33:12,458
we'll just say to one another,
like, "Can you believe it?

1444
01:33:13,351 --> 01:33:15,753
"Can you believe
we're still doing this?"

1445
01:33:21,526 --> 01:33:23,561
When I interviewed the band in 1993

1446
01:33:24,069 --> 01:33:26,472
for Rolling Stone magazine,
I asked Eddie Vedder

1447
01:33:27,073 --> 01:33:28,240
if there was an Andy Wood song

1448
01:33:28,532 --> 01:33:30,368
he would ever
be interested in singing.

1449
01:33:30,827 --> 01:33:33,229
He said there was one
and one day he would sing it.

1450
01:33:36,164 --> 01:33:38,533
On the band's 10th anniversary
show in Las Vegas,

1451
01:33:39,586 --> 01:33:41,988
he announced to the group that
he wanted to sing Crown of Thorns,

1452
01:33:42,754 --> 01:33:44,990
one of Mother Love Bone's
greatest songs.

1453
01:33:45,549 --> 01:33:47,951
And in that moment,
the two bands united.

1454
01:33:50,638 --> 01:33:52,339
We wouldn't...

1455
01:33:52,764 --> 01:33:55,167
We wouldn't mind attempting something

1456
01:33:55,768 --> 01:33:58,170
that's even older than 10 years.

1457
01:34:35,974 --> 01:34:38,377
For Ed to kind of
acknowledge the past and sort of say,

1458
01:34:39,144 --> 01:34:40,312
"Yeah, this is part of
where we came from, "

1459
01:34:40,604 --> 01:34:42,806
and that he would be generous to Jeff
and I and say, "Yeah, of course."

1460
01:34:43,357 --> 01:34:45,760
That was another huge, huge gift.

1461
01:34:51,824 --> 01:34:53,992
I used to think of Andy all the time,

1462
01:34:54,534 --> 01:34:56,136
especially when the band got bigger,

1463
01:34:56,537 --> 01:34:57,905
because I used to think,

1464
01:34:58,247 --> 01:35:00,316
"He would have loved
to play this place.

1465
01:35:00,833 --> 01:35:02,434
"He would have loved
to play this place.

1466
01:35:02,834 --> 01:35:05,237
"He'd love to play The Garden."

1467
01:35:06,088 --> 01:35:08,490
He would have tore this shit up.

1468
01:35:59,392 --> 01:36:01,227
And I wrote down on this paper
"Andy and Ed, "

1469
01:36:01,686 --> 01:36:03,454
just because I think about Andy
all the time,

1470
01:36:03,896 --> 01:36:05,364
and in the creative process,
I always think about

1471
01:36:05,731 --> 01:36:08,100
how lucky I am to still be able
to, like, you know,

1472
01:36:08,692 --> 01:36:11,095
go in my basement or, like, pick up
a guitar and, like, write a song

1473
01:36:11,987 --> 01:36:13,222
and then manifest it if I want,

1474
01:36:13,531 --> 01:36:15,933
figure out how to, like,
record it or whatever, and that...

1475
01:36:17,034 --> 01:36:18,836
That's kind of all he ever hoped for,

1476
01:36:19,287 --> 01:36:20,855
is just somebody
that would just record him

1477
01:36:21,247 --> 01:36:22,848
and, like, some group of guys
that would just, you know,

1478
01:36:23,248 --> 01:36:25,651
play these songs for him
or whatever, and l...

1479
01:36:26,794 --> 01:36:29,196
I wish that we could go back in time
and be the band for him.

1480
01:36:54,404 --> 01:36:56,807
He was playing in those places
in his head...

1481
01:37:00,244 --> 01:37:01,311
for a long time.

1482
01:37:01,578 --> 01:37:03,981
So the thing is,
is he got to play them.

1483
01:37:15,968 --> 01:37:18,370
Andy.

1484
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:51,571
We played a show in Nassau.

1485
01:37:51,879 --> 01:37:53,981
I would say three-quarters
of the crowd fucking booed us.

1486
01:37:54,507 --> 01:37:56,509
It actually really bummed
some of the band out.

1487
01:37:57,009 --> 01:37:59,411
They were just, like, "I never
want to play that song again."

1488
01:38:01,179 --> 01:38:03,582
I actually fucking dug it.
It was art.

1489
01:38:11,148 --> 01:38:13,117
I remember there was
a fireman in the front row,

1490
01:38:13,609 --> 01:38:14,910
and he was, like,
showing me his badge.

1491
01:38:15,236 --> 01:38:17,205
Fuck you, asshole!

1492
01:38:17,697 --> 01:38:19,565
It was just a bad time
in American history in my mind,

1493
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:22,435
and we were trying to say
what we thought.

1494
01:38:27,498 --> 01:38:29,400
When you know the crowd has turned

1495
01:38:29,876 --> 01:38:31,077
and there are that many people,

1496
01:38:31,377 --> 01:38:33,779
it just feels like you might not
make it out of there alive.

1497
01:38:40,219 --> 01:38:41,887
That was Ed
really trusting his instincts

1498
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:44,706
about a very specific thing
that he needed to say,

1499
01:38:45,474 --> 01:38:47,876
and he wanted to do it in a way
that was antagonistic.

1500
01:38:53,733 --> 01:38:55,601
I think if you have the opportunity,

1501
01:38:56,068 --> 01:38:58,470
you have to... You have to
take on that responsibility.

1502
01:39:28,934 --> 01:39:31,069
You didn't like that one.

1503
01:39:31,603 --> 01:39:33,539
It’s great to be in a band

1504
01:39:34,023 --> 01:39:35,558
where, you know,
we're not afraid to do that,

1505
01:39:35,942 --> 01:39:38,211
not afraid to speak our minds

1506
01:39:38,778 --> 01:39:41,180
and get booed once in a while.
It's all right.

1507
01:39:44,742 --> 01:39:46,310
It was an uncertain time
for Pearl Jam,

1508
01:39:46,702 --> 01:39:49,105
a period when many bands
quietly break up and move on.

1509
01:39:49,913 --> 01:39:51,415
But from the beginning,
Stone and Jeff

1510
01:39:51,791 --> 01:39:53,259
had always wanted a band
that would last,

1511
01:39:53,626 --> 01:39:55,895
one that would keep writing
and recording music,

1512
01:39:56,503 --> 01:39:58,872
and that's what Pearl Jam did.

1513
01:39:59,464 --> 01:40:01,466
Show by show, they became

1514
01:40:01,967 --> 01:40:04,370
one of the most dependably
unpredictable bands in rock.

1515
01:40:07,348 --> 01:40:09,750
Ed has a feeling pretty
much everywhere that we play,

1516
01:40:11,686 --> 01:40:13,154
and it's such a great gauge of,
you know,

1517
01:40:13,521 --> 01:40:15,523
how the crowd's feeling,
and that's, a lot of times,

1518
01:40:16,023 --> 01:40:17,458
why the set list
doesn't get done until...

1519
01:40:17,817 --> 01:40:20,219
I mean, oftentimes, it's done
10 minutes before we play.

1520
01:40:21,362 --> 01:40:23,197
As difficult as it was
at different times,

1521
01:40:23,656 --> 01:40:26,059
where you're like, "We can
go out and kill this crowd.

1522
01:40:26,659 --> 01:40:27,960
"We can go out
and kill them right now.

1523
01:40:28,286 --> 01:40:29,654
"Let's just start out
with these five songs."

1524
01:40:29,996 --> 01:40:32,365
And you know...
"Yeah. No. We're gonna go on,

1525
01:40:32,957 --> 01:40:35,359
"we're gonna play this one
to start out with."

1526
01:40:38,546 --> 01:40:40,515
"We haven't played
this one together, but let's...

1527
01:40:41,007 --> 01:40:42,909
"We'll work it out backstage.
It'll be fine."

1528
01:40:43,384 --> 01:40:44,852
And inevitably, you're so nervous

1529
01:40:45,219 --> 01:40:46,286
that you go out there and fumble it,

1530
01:40:46,553 --> 01:40:48,255
and then you're like,
"God! Let me just...

1531
01:40:48,681 --> 01:40:51,084
"Let's play a hit, you know."

1532
01:40:55,854 --> 01:40:58,257
You know, it would be a lot easier
to play a similar set every night.

1533
01:40:58,899 --> 01:41:00,901
It would just be so much easier,

1534
01:41:01,402 --> 01:41:03,804
and yet we can't find it
in ourselves to do that.

1535
01:41:16,251 --> 01:41:18,386
That's why you see Pearl Jam.

1536
01:41:18,919 --> 01:41:20,788
It’s fucking different every night.

1537
01:41:21,256 --> 01:41:23,658
Every night it's different.

1538
01:41:26,761 --> 01:41:29,030
It’s funny, but lots
of those decisions we made,

1539
01:41:29,597 --> 01:41:31,732
it took 10 years to see
why they were good.

1540
01:41:32,266 --> 01:41:33,434
In  that regard, you know,

1541
01:41:33,726 --> 01:41:35,094
mixing our set list up every night,

1542
01:41:35,436 --> 01:41:36,771
it's the greatest blessing
we could have ever done.

1543
01:41:37,146 --> 01:41:39,515
The door is so open for us
to be who we are every night

1544
01:41:41,442 --> 01:41:43,844
that we just trust it.

1545
01:41:58,709 --> 01:42:00,244
You know, I think that all of us

1546
01:42:00,628 --> 01:42:01,962
have been totally influenced
by the seventies.

1547
01:42:02,296 --> 01:42:04,198
We're all, like, products of it,
but yet we're not, like, stuck in it.

1548
01:42:04,673 --> 01:42:07,076
Our classic guitar heroes,
you know, like Hendrix for Mike

1549
01:42:07,968 --> 01:42:09,103
and, like, Jimmy Page for me,

1550
01:42:09,387 --> 01:42:11,289
and, like, for Eddie, it's like
he totally loved The Who.

1551
01:42:11,764 --> 01:42:13,132
The Who was
the greatest rock band ever.

1552
01:42:13,474 --> 01:42:15,075
It's like all these bands,
so in a sense,

1553
01:42:15,476 --> 01:42:17,879
it's a total tribute
to the seventies.

1554
01:42:40,543 --> 01:42:42,912
Roger Daltrey wrote me a letter
saying would I like to come play,

1555
01:42:44,004 --> 01:42:46,406
and I told him no way,
because that's it.

1556
01:42:47,216 --> 01:42:48,918
That's the ultimate.
That's the pinnacle for me,

1557
01:42:49,343 --> 01:42:50,411
is that band, you know,

1558
01:42:50,678 --> 01:42:53,080
that arrow on the mod sign, you know.

1559
01:42:54,514 --> 01:42:56,917
We have to decide whether or not
we're going to remain a circus act.

1560
01:42:59,187 --> 01:43:00,621
In  other words, doing what everybody

1561
01:43:00,979 --> 01:43:03,382
knows we can do and what
we know we can do. Right?

1562
01:43:04,567 --> 01:43:06,969
Until the band eventually
turns into a cabaret act,

1563
01:43:07,778 --> 01:43:09,580
- which is inevitable.
- No, that's ridiculous!

1564
01:43:10,031 --> 01:43:12,166
Here's me and Johnny Ramone.
I'm wearing a Bob Dole mask.

1565
01:43:12,699 --> 01:43:13,567
Uncle Neil.

1566
01:43:13,784 --> 01:43:15,419
This is me and Joe Strummer.

1567
01:43:15,828 --> 01:43:17,229
And that's the night I met
Jack lrons.

1568
01:43:17,579 --> 01:43:18,714
This was hanging in a dressing room.

1569
01:43:18,998 --> 01:43:21,167
It was actually the first night
I had met Pete.

1570
01:43:21,709 --> 01:43:22,710
I was terrified.

1571
01:43:22,961 --> 01:43:24,729
And the first thing he said was,

1572
01:43:25,171 --> 01:43:27,573
"I've waited so long to meet you."

1573
01:43:41,353 --> 01:43:43,756
Now we're just grateful
for our band and who we are

1574
01:43:44,732 --> 01:43:46,901
and what we've become,

1575
01:43:47,443 --> 01:43:49,845
and grateful that we finally
figured out how to do it.

1576
01:43:52,573 --> 01:43:53,841
I think that there was a huge element

1577
01:43:54,158 --> 01:43:56,427
of our fans
that just kind of carried us

1578
01:43:56,994 --> 01:43:59,396
through a period of time where
we were not there all the way.

1579
01:44:00,664 --> 01:44:02,866
You see their belief,
and even when you don't have it,

1580
01:44:03,417 --> 01:44:05,820
you go,
"Okay. I've got to figure this out."

1581
01:44:10,590 --> 01:44:12,759
Joining the band,
I was super impressed

1582
01:44:13,302 --> 01:44:14,704
with how in-house everything is.

1583
01:44:15,054 --> 01:44:17,456
Like, there's no outside
influence going on, you know.

1584
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:20,034
It's like it all comes from the band.

1585
01:44:20,434 --> 01:44:22,836
They saved me in a certain way.

1586
01:44:35,783 --> 01:44:38,185
You know, we've been doing it
for 10 records or 20 years,

1587
01:44:39,453 --> 01:44:41,155
and I can't think of a show
where I ever felt

1588
01:44:41,580 --> 01:44:43,982
like I was just phoning it in.

1589
01:44:44,625 --> 01:44:47,027
It’s always pure stoke,
you know, like...

1590
01:44:54,468 --> 01:44:56,570
I think that there really is, like,

1591
01:44:57,095 --> 01:44:59,498
a collective understanding
of how lucky and how fortunate we are

1592
01:45:01,475 --> 01:45:03,343
to still be playing music
with the same group of people.

1593
01:45:03,810 --> 01:45:05,145
I mean, everybody, you can feel it,

1594
01:45:05,479 --> 01:45:07,881
and it makes being in a band a joy.

1595
01:45:29,128 --> 01:45:31,530
There's a... This communal exchange.

1596
01:45:32,965 --> 01:45:34,466
And there's obviously a line drawn

1597
01:45:34,842 --> 01:45:36,444
between who's on stage
and who's in the crowd,

1598
01:45:36,844 --> 01:45:39,246
but not really.

1599
01:48:27,305 --> 01:48:29,474
I fucking loved it.
We were two rows from the front.

1600
01:48:30,017 --> 01:48:31,319
It was fucking incredible.

1601
01:48:31,644 --> 01:48:33,012
- This was my fifth show.
- 24.

1602
01:48:33,354 --> 01:48:34,655
- 61.
- 54.

1603
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:37,382
153.

1604
01:48:39,443 --> 01:48:40,711
Pearl Jam are a band for the fans.

1605
01:48:41,028 --> 01:48:42,630
"If you love us, stick with us, "

1606
01:48:43,030 --> 01:48:44,197
and we've stuck with them
all the way,

1607
01:48:44,489 --> 01:48:46,525
because what we get out of them
is overwhelming.

1608
01:48:47,034 --> 01:48:48,736
These guys flew
from Bucharest this morning.

1609
01:48:49,203 --> 01:48:50,070
Budapest.

1610
01:48:50,287 --> 01:48:51,288
We came from Denver.

1611
01:48:51,538 --> 01:48:52,640
- Townsville, Australia.
- London, England.

1612
01:48:52,915 --> 01:48:53,949
Took two weeks off from my job,

1613
01:48:54,208 --> 01:48:56,577
and traveled to nine shows in a row
last tour.

1614
01:49:05,887 --> 01:49:07,455
There's not another band like them.

1615
01:49:07,888 --> 01:49:09,623
Everybody rode the whole
crest of a wave with Ten,

1616
01:49:10,057 --> 01:49:11,625
and it was just the thing to be into,

1617
01:49:12,017 --> 01:49:13,386
but after that, they've
come out a lot stronger,

1618
01:49:13,728 --> 01:49:14,628
because they didn't play the game.

1619
01:49:14,853 --> 01:49:16,789
They took on Ticketmaster.
They were pissed off

1620
01:49:17,273 --> 01:49:18,140
that people were getting ripped off,

1621
01:49:18,399 --> 01:49:19,166
and they took on the man,

1622
01:49:19,358 --> 01:49:21,760
and they could have lost,
but they didn't.

1623
01:49:24,279 --> 01:49:26,682
I think this band
is really only beginning.

1624
01:53:47,042 --> 01:53:47,910
There was a rumor

1625
01:53:48,127 --> 01:53:49,428
that it was sort of gonna be
like The Kids Are Alright.

1626
01:53:49,753 --> 01:53:52,156
That would be a misconception,
because The Kids Are Alright

1627
01:53:53,382 --> 01:53:55,351
is really super genius,

1628
01:53:55,843 --> 01:53:58,245
and what we're gonna put out
is gonna be really super us.

1629
01:54:06,144 --> 01:54:08,547
Hey, Josh. How's it going?

1630
01:54:10,065 --> 01:54:12,467
Fuck you, Kevin.

1631
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:17,748
They stay true to fans as well,

1632
01:54:18,115 --> 01:54:19,383
about them releasing
the bootlegs of their albums

1633
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:21,868
so that other people can't bootleg
them and make a sly penny off it,

1634
01:54:22,410 --> 01:54:24,813
and that's clever shit.

1635
01:54:40,262 --> 01:54:42,098
We're not filming
this conversation, are we?

1636
01:54:42,557 --> 01:54:44,959
Yes, we are.

1637
01:55:07,539 --> 01:55:09,942
Now you're back.
Why do you keep doing it?

1638
01:55:30,604 --> 01:55:33,440
I don't know whether they realize exactly
how much they have given to us, the fans,

1639
01:55:34,524 --> 01:55:36,826
...and how much we really appreciate.

1640
