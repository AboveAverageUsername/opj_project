you want sign here even.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,700

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,900

it is strong, thus we must isolate him and observe.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,500

102
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,900
I needed four walls and a ceiling.

104
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,900

considering you the last 
three has been years busy
and more than

115
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,900
without practical operational 
battle field results,

116
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I would say that to the 
time start is... now.

117
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,900
this is nou not real how I 
thought that a military basis saw.

118
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,900
it seems more to verdomme on a prison.
perhaps it is no ordinary military basis.

119
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,700
it best an elite entity thing is able be.

120
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,900

have been notable we not 
really types for the elite.

he sits on lock.

123
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,900
why we verdomme have been locked up. 
- It can be sometimes a psychological test.

124
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
to if look at we break 
under very.

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
dead has escaped. 
- What?

345
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,800
it is necessary retrieve them, major.

346
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,900
use you men. 
- My men disappear!

347
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,900
that flatlied refuse monster 
which you have created.

348
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,400
nonsenses. 
You are of the American army.

349
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,900
I am undermanned here, oké?
you have half of my men change 
in test objects!

350
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,900
you can call no strengthening?
you crazy person has become?

351
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,900
Weet you, however, what they will do 
if they can do at hogerhand what we here?

352
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,900
then they close the tent!

353
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,900
and to forget our carri?res, 
which are thus beyond.

354
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,900
you have me the debt because 
your soldiers cannot the test bring persons?

355
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,900
lords, alsjeblieft, we have 
a problem which must be solved.

356
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,900
how much is of him above? 
- Mean how you?

357
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,900
I mean above,

358
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,800
the original boy where you have started.

359
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,900
that is difficult predict. 
He produces too much adrenalin.

360
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
he is himself in overdrive. 
He functions as an animal.

361
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,900
an animal, a flatlied refuse malignant animal.
and he hunts on our all three.

362
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,900
a manner must be there.

363
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,900
we have him this way programmed 
that he thinks firstly and then just.

364
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,900
you have programmed a war hero!

365
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,300
what had then expected you? 
- He was a test object.
he and the others must be included.

366
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,900
ingesloten, you want have included them?

367
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Oké, they will be included.

368
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,400
if you hear something, clamour 
me then immediately.

369
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
why you do not will rest just as? 
Then I ensure here, however, the rest.

370
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,300
you are lief... The majoor gets it, 
however, under control.

371
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
if he does not do it, I it does.

372
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Lenox, are you there?

373
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
kloot never with delta Force.

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
which side? 
- That weet I not.

375
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
it is exactly a labyrinth.

376
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,900
what? 
- Nothing. You see there what differently. 
That is everything.

377
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,900
nou I can look forward to there not on my best now.

378
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,900

- Sees you good.

379
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000

00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
it keeps but for if we here from its.
yes, well ideas.

381
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,900

- Weet you it certain?

382
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,100
yes, I have a good feeling 
for direction.

383
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
we let try these.

384
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000

- He is no longer recognise.

386
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
that is repugnant.

387
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,900
the sheds. 
- Nice.

388
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,700
we are at finished. 
- Why don't you lead the way then?

389
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
someone arrives there.

390
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Carrie, we are it! 
- Sorry.

391
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,200

saints G.I Jane?

military nipples!

393
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,900
Weet I not. But there we have on 
nothing if there a maniac walks about.

394
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,900

- Yes, and he is very pissig, 
therefore hou you look.

395
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000

- Weet I not. I must be him lost.

396
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,500
strangely, I can see well. 
- What has them with our done?

397
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Weet I not. Does it go with your?

398
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,900
your faces see good.

399
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,800
I feel myself a beetje strangely 
as if I have sat in a roller coaster.

400
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,200
and I can you say that she found it nice.

401
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,900
well, we must make that we come here from.

402
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,900
once even you wait! 
Has you given who here the control?

403
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,900
that weet I not. 
Do you do want remain rather here then?

404
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,900
we would have had remain 
on the first in our shed,
instead of listening to you.

405
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,900
you want to the shed? 
Those are there.

and waits if you become still ever awake.

409
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
what they have done, our crazy person makes!

410
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,100
bowls, Carrie, we obtain you.

411
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,900
bowls, here wear we no time for!

412
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,300
me leaves with rest! 
- Oké, boys and little girls.

413
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,900

414
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000

415
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
bowls, incur!

416
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
will lie!

417
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,900
quietly remain, knul.

418
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,900
what is that verdomme for a thing? 
- Do that weapon omlaag.

419
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,900
answer! - He is an experimenting.

420
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,900
for which?

421
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,900
it hot the Hella programme, 
devised to make better soldiers.

422
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,900
what is there wrong with the soldiers 
who you have?
we had too few recruits.

423
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
and the one which we got were not 
such as we them former had.

424
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:13,000
we had do it with what we could get, 
and had them better make.

425
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,900
by changing them in animals?

426
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,600
he is an experimenting. He only one 
beetje improve has become then we had 
has been thought.

427
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,900
what has you with him done? 
- We have him rebuild.

428
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,900
with a radical tribe cell procedures.

429
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,900
that ensures that damaged fabric two 
times strongly returns this way such 
as that was.

430
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,500
and at the last parts of the treatment 
went it wrong. And now he has been 
twisted by.

431
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
who he is?

432
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
he is a real soldier, Waylon.

433
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,900
sergeants dead.

434
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,500
he moaned to our, why moaned he this way?

435
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
that is another bijwerking of the procedure.

436
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
when he touches excited...

437
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:15,000
gets he sexual needs.

438
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
therefore he is violently and geil.

439
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,900
only if it is provoked.

440
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,900
therefore that is what with us will there happen.

441
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
it has already started. 
God-far-stupid one.

442
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,900
quietly.

443
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,200
heads near! Do we soon also change in of those freaks?

444
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,900
no, the answer is no, dead was 
already too strong start.

445
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,900
we have adjusted everything on new.
you a much have all got smaller amount.

446
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,600
but you cannot touch excited. 
Because there the problems start

447
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
why we?

448
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,900
answers its, klootzak.

449
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,900
dead was too strong.

450
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,900
we had give to the recruits 
whom we had. We had it...

451
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,400
give to them that it most necessary had. 
- What means you with that?

452
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,900
he means us.

453
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
gone astray meiden.

454
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Losers.

455
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,900
zwakkelingen.

456
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
hé, speak for yourself.

457
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,800
you are a sick klootzak, Weet you that? 
- I am a soldier!

458
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I have a mission, and I descend 
those to make, Waylon.

459
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:48,000
phthises, we have been sewed! 
-Carrie, want keep you alsjeblieft your head!

460
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,500
everyone does not run a risk. 
- Hoezo not?

461
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,900
you have all got another amount.
some have had the complete treatment.

462
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,900
and the others placebo.

463
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
has who what, bowl on which 
the complete treatment has had?!
that only knows the doktoren!

464
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Oké, lustre, give the gun me. 
- Verdomme from my buurt remain!

465
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Waylon... 
- What?

466
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,900
I do not believe that it is well 
that you have a weapon in your hand.

467
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,900
why you do not think that I have it? 
- No, but I feel myself improve 
if you deliver him.

468
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,900
want you him sometimes have? 
- No, I wants only that you do him gone.

469
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,900
Oké, I take over it, I take over.

476
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,900
that was its dead man bud bug 
which we had not yet obtained from.
it is at least good bug.

477
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,900
I suspect that we know now 
who has had the full milk shake.

478
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,900
raap her, we go up.

479
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000

He walks around there still.

481
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000

If we can approach him to anaesthetise him,

00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
