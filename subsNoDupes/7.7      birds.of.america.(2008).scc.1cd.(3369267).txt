<i>My father left
me this house.</i>

00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:58,015
<i>And the mortgage,
when I was 18.</i>

00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:04,821
<i>Along with his first edition
of Audubon Birds of America,</i>

<i>a 12-year-old sister
and a 7-year-old brother.</i>

7
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,733
<i>And fairly serious
bowel issues.</i>

8
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,648
<i>I didn't do a great job raising
my little brother and sister,</i>

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,916
<i>Most people would agree at
least one of them was unstable,</i>

you asked the other one,</i>

00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,091

considered reliable.</i>

<i>Dinner's ready I</i>

13
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,204
Any luck?

<i>However you look at it, life
is an awful lot of... shit I</i>

15
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,687
Hello?

16
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,022
What time
is it?

17
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,618
I'm sorry.
What?

18
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,687
Did...?

19
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,671
Mm!

20
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,006
Ida Csonka Photography.

21
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,842
<i>Hey sis,
it's me.</i>

22
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,472
<i>Hey I How's
it going?</i>

23
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,313
<i>Listen, Jay... well, I
don't want you to worry,</i>

24
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,354
<i>well, he was beat
up and hospitalized.</i>

25
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,287
N uh uh.

26
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:48,851
<i>Then he was slightly, he's fine,
run over but he's totally fine.</i>

27
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,361
Oh, oh.

28
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,022
<i>I'll keep
you posted.</i>

29
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:56,398
Good luck with the job and
don't eat while you're driving.

30
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,404
<i>And no more
hitchhikers, right?</i>

31
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,047
Hey.
You okay?

32
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,154
That's good.

33
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,232
What about your
classes, honey?

34
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,929
You can't
just take off.

35
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,767
Can you call the school or Paul?

36
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,397
It's just not
great timing.

37
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,704
Have I ever missed a
class in seven years?

38
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,404
No, Why do you always have to deal, huh?

39
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,379
Why can't Ida deal
with something for once?

40
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,780
Ida is nowhere near here. She's
on her way to a shoot, a paid one.

41
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,514
A paid shoot, that
would be a slight change.

42
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:49,885
So are you
gonna be long?

43
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,117
I'll call you when I
know what's happening.

44
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,419
Okay, drive carefully.

45
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,015
Well, bye.

46
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:33,763
Thanks a lot.

47
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,323
No, thank you!

48
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,020
Don't you want
to get settled?

49
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,756
I don't live here.

50
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,627
You moved?

51
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,132
About a month ago.

52
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,032
Then what...?

53
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:30,647
Are you doing
drugs again?

54
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,487
I told you, Morrie, I
no longer try to heighten

55
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:39,395
or dull my senses artificially.
I'm really a new person.

56
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:44,300
And where exactly does
this new person live?

57
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,802
<i>This is where
I sleep.</i>

58
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,468
<i>I gathered leaves
for the mattress.</i>

59
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,843
<i>You wouldn't believe
how comfortable it is.</i>

60
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,374
<i>What are
you eating?</i>

61
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,386
The future is
in the ground.

62
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,547
I've planted seeds.

63
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,256
<i>I wanna live clean. I'm
not a burden out here.</i>

64
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,726
Burden?

65
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:13,163
<i>Hear the birds?
I sit,</i>

66
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,221
I see snakes.

67
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,326
There's a beaver.

68
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:21,032
<i>Can you believe that, Morrie? A beaverl</i>

69
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,837
I'm good, Morrie.

70
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,346
What? Were you afraid
to call again for cash?

71
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:35,685
No. I want to try
having less.

72
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,882
<i>See what my life would
be like without all the...</i>

73
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:48,523
stuff, the noise.

74
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,432
Where is
your stuff?

75
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,028
<i>I gave
everything away.</i>

76
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,505
<i>Everything?</i>

77
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,564
Every last thing.

78
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,200
<i>U h-huh.</i>

79
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:04,147
<i>Not Dad's first edition of
Audubon Birds of America?</i>

80
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,650
Not your
card collection?

81
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,433
What if you took a break
and stayed with us for a bit?

82
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,997
Please?

83
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:35,138
Oh! N ice lunch break.
Do you need a hand?

84
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,648
No, thank you!
I'm okay.

85
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,116
<i>How's the
little one today?</i>

86
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,710
Sleeping, thank goodness.
It was a rough night.

87
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,152
Take a nap.
I'll watch him.

88
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,157
Oh, once I finish
with this disaster.

89
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:50,491
U m, hey, Paul said
Morrie wasn't in school.

90
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,326
Is there
an emergency?

91
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,629
Yes! Well, what else would keep
Mr. Dedication out of school, right?

92
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,134
Everything okay?

93
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,536
<i>Well, yeah, no, Jay
had an accident.</i>

94
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,267
It wasn't his fault.

95
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,672
Got clipped
by a car.

96
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,768
Oh my
gosh! No!

97
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,939
He's gonna be okay. Morrie's
gonna bring him home for dinner.

98
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,109
Oh, is only Jay
coming home?

99
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,446
Of course.

100
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,487
Paul loves you guys,
it's just that...

101
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,921
I know.
And I agree.

102
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,857
<i>What is it with Morrie's
family and accidents?</i>

103
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,953
Oh, duty calls.

104
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,726
I'll see you in a little while.

105
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,164
Yep.

106
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,218
Hey!

107
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,186
H i, Jay.

108
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,487
Oh my gosh.

109
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,856
Well,

110
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,421
you must
be famished.

111
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,693
No, not especially.

112
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:06,966
Well, this is nice.

113
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,269
Did you want to change before we...

114
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,604
No.

115
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:11,973
No.
Okay.

116
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:22,046
<i>Alright. I am gonna fix you some...</i>

117
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,250
Is that meat meat or is that soy meat?

118
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:28,725
Soy meat?

119
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,661
Are you
a vegetarian?

120
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,494
A vegan.

121
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,397
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't know.

122
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,665
Oh, that's okay. Jay
can have a Caesar Salad

123
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,933
and some
garlic bread.

124
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,271
I'm a...
I'm a vegan.

125
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,903
No animal products.

126
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,412
You go ahead.

127
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,939
Not even
cheese or butter?

128
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:56,853
Milk is
for calves...

129
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:57,946
to suckle.

130
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:04,790
<i>Honey, why don't you sit
down and I'll find something.</i>

131
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,595
How... about...
some... oatmeal?

132
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,068
Great. Can't have
oatmeal for dinner.

133
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,661
Why not?

134
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,229
<i>We'll get some veggie
stuff. We'll stock up.</i>

135
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,104
Stock up?

136
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,442
Okay.

137
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,452
Well, this
is nice, isn't it?

138
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,597
<i>Paul and Laura
got a dog...</i>

139
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,294
Shh!

140
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,532
<i>That relieves itself on
our lawn many times a day.</i>

141
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,664
That's okay,
that's okay.

142
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,606
That's okay.

143
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,345
Did you
say anything?

144
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,880
<i>We can't.</i>

145
00:11:55,948 --> 00:12:00,317
We can't do anything. We'd
like to, really, not yet.

146
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,320
<i>Paul is one of
the faculty members</i>

147
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,787
<i>who recommended
me for tenure.</i>

148
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,723
And he's on the
board of regents

149
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,692
and he golfs
with the provost.

150
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,626
And I need
his support.

151
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,529
No, that's not
what you need.

152
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,166
I'm gonna get those dishes done.

153
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,939
Your room's all ready for you, Jay.

154
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,636
I left clean towels on the bed.

155
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,235
I think I'm gonna stay in the attic.

156
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,338
Why? There's
nothing up there.

157
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,508
The cot still
up there?

158
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,677
<i>Oh Jay, you might as
well sleep on the ground.</i>

159
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,519
<i>I really think you'd be more
comfortable in your room.</i>

160
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,184
I'd like to stay
in the attic.

161
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,628
<i>Okay. I'll give
it a quick sweep.</i>

162
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,066
You know what I really
don't want to find?

163
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:57,269
My little brother swinging
from a rafter in the attic.

164
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,402
I already told
you, Morrie.

165
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:02,914
J ust because I was laying in the
road doesn't mean I was trying to...

166
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,244
<i>Did you fall down?</i>

167
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,546
Did you pass out?

168
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,280
<i>Were you trying to...</i>

169
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,514
Feel.

00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,313
Emily's a nice name,
don't you think?

176
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,513
How about Copenose?

177
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,244
You okay?

178
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,943
What's going on?
He alright?

179
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,007
Jay?

180
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,712
I called Ida
and she said

181
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,051
she's gonna come to
stay with us for a bit.

182
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,490
<i>Hello? Good morning I</i>

183
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,856
Isn't that great?

184
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,657
H i!

185
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:34,961
H i! How are you?
A little angel!

186
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,003
He a good little boy!

187
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,196
H i, Laura!

188
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,262
H i Morrie,
how's it going?

189
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,500
Mm.

190
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,098
How's Jay?

191
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,370
Mm.

192
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,672
Better than ever.

193
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,771
Oh! H i!
Welcome home!

194
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:50,974
It's so nice
to see you.

195
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,540
Really?

196
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:56,714
Well, yeah, really! Hey,
you wanna meet my little guy?

197
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,782
Here. Say hi.
H i, Jay.

198
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,123
Is he okay?

199
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,685
Yeah, why?

200
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:11,099
H is head
is misshapen.

201
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,330
Oh.

202
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,632
Is that
a condition?

203
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,866
Okay.

204
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,741
He had a
little accident.

205
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,837
What the hell
are you doing?

206
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,313
Are you trying
to sabotage me?

207
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,078
The truth can
set you free.

208
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,210
No, tenure
can set me free.

209
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:32,155
<i>We're not even sure
he can see properly.</i>

210
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:38,220
To take a sabbatical or a vacation
for the first time in seven years.

211
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,561
See you later.

212
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,499
Ooh.
We're gonna be late!

213
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,197
Do me a favor. You know the pin number.

214
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,795
Go buy yourself
some clothes,

215
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:51,673
or some soy nuts
or mashed fish oil.

216
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:34,685
Acceleration, as we know, refers
to the change in velocity over time.

217
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:40,817
<i>SI unit of acceleration is
meters per second squared or...</i>

218
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:52,326
Since the average speed
of an object is determined

219
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:58,343
by dividing the distance
the object travels by the...

220
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,004
we are out of time.

221
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,672
Hey, buddy.
You're still here?

222
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,772
Yeah.
Grant application.

223
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,511
I spoke to
Laura at lunch.

224
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,213
<i>She told me Jay is not
doing too well. You poor guy.</i>

225
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,687
Yeah.
Thanks.

226
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:48,556
How you do it. Some
kind of brain injury?

227
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,356
<i>Well, I don't
know about that,</i>

228
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,660
but something
seems to be... awry.

229
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,292
I think he was very
insulting to Laura today.

230
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,165
No!

231
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,432
<i>We don't have
to have dinner.</i>

232
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,703
No! I mean, I wouldn't care but Laura...

233
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,265
Of course.

234
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,834
<i>Maybe Jay
could just...</i>

235
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,005
<i>Sure, he wouldn't
want to come.</i>

236
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:12,141
I mean, he'd be
fine not coming.

237
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,479
<i>Great.</i>

238
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,487
<i>You are really something.
Heroic. I mean it.</i>

239
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,618
I mean it,
I do.

240
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,993
I mean, Jay's
always been kinda...

241
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,329
Well, he was just a
little kid when Dad died.

242
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,425
Yeah.

243
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,970
And Mom.
Right away.

244
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:38,670
<i>That's true, and these
things can be in the genes.</i>

245
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:46,548
"Anyhoo", you must be
doing something right.

246
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:49,451
You're looking awful damn good
for someone so beleaguered.

247
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,079
<i>I'll see
you laterl</i>

248
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,565
Ida Csonka Photography.

249
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:05,660
<i>Hi therel</i>

250
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,534
Hey Morrie,
what's up?

251
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,471
<i>Okay if we postponed
your visit a bit?</i>

252
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,906
Why?

253
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,968
Well, I just don't think
this is the ideal time

254
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,172
for you to
come home.

255
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,745
What's wrong?

256
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,185
<i>Nothing. I just thought that
you were one of two people</i>

257
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,086
who actually wanted
me to come home.

258
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,024
<i>Of course. I always
want you to come home.</i>

259
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,924
I know.

260
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,862
<i>I'm glad
you understand.</i>

261
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,923
Jay's gonna be here a
while, at least a month.

262
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,129
<i>I would like to accommodate
you, I really would,</i>

263
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,035
there's just
one problem.

264
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,596
<i>What's that?</i>

265
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,612
<i>Hey I</i>

266
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:04,052
<i>Oh my god. Are you
alright? You look terrible.</i>

267
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,197
So do you.

268
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,133
I do?

269
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,534
No, you don't.

270
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,367
You look tired.

271
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,236
No, she doesn't.

272
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,775
<i>Well, I haven't
slept all night.</i>

273
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,539
Still eating yourself?

274
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,204
I wish.

275
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,612
You look beautiful.

276
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:24,979
I do?

277
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,518
Gosh, Ida, it's been
ages, you look great.

278
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,575
I do?

279
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,246
Hey, Ida.

280
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,311
H i, Betty.

281
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,379
How are you?

282
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,924
I'm fine,
how are you?

283
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:37,428
Oh! I'm fine, how are you?

284
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,623
I'm fine.
How are you?

285
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:43,996
Okay.

286
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,955
It's so weird
being back here.

287
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,926
Because of Gary?

288
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,638
<i>Ida, your room
is all ready.</i>

289
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,609
There's fresh
towels on the bed.

290
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,578
I'm gonna stay in the
basement, if that's okay.

291
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:29,739
It's out
of control.

292
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,045
I don't mind.

293
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,415
<i>It's too bizarre staying in my old room.</i>

294
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,849
<i>Hello?
Hi, Nancy.</i>

295
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,951
<i>Well, we just sat down
to dinner, but what's up?</i>

296
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,461
Why is
it bizarre?

297
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,894
I don't know.

298
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,659
Isn't it weird sleeping
in Mom and Dad's room?

299
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,668
<i>Really? That
is strange.</i>

300
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:54,433
I'll call you back when we're
done. Thanks, Nancy. Sorry.

301
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,471
That was Nancy Kennedy on the phone.

302
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:02,172
Jay, she says you gave her
something today on Brock Street?

303
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,648
Nancy Kennedy?
Is she...

304
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,813
the blonde with
the false chest?

305
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,150
<i>I mplants?</i>

306
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,212
I think so.

307
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,484
I wondered
about that.

308
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,786
<i>I don't
remember Nancy.</i>

309
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,657
The blonde with
the false chest?

310
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,664
Anyway. She said Jay
gave her 20 dollars.

311
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,962
She said you gave a lot
of people 20 dollars.

312
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,367
Is 25 a lot
of people?

313
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:31,068
You gave 25
people 20 dollars?

314
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,407
I hope...

315
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:37,710
<i>I know that's not the
500 dollars I gave you.</i>

316
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,745
<i>Honey, why did
you do that?</i>

317
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,221
<i>Another bill for the
washer-dryer came today.</i>

318
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,663
Okay.

319
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,897
<i>There's a lot of bills piling up.</i>

320
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,494
Okay.

321
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:03,166
Have your new washer
and dryer made you happy?

322
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,605
Yes, Jay,
they have.

323
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,773
<i>Would you like
to know why?</i>

324
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:13,613
I would.

325
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,087
Because now,

326
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,888
I don't have to spend
twenty minutes in the morning

327
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,429
before I go to work
at the bank

328
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:30,298
<i>scraping soap particles and
residue off Morrie's and my clothes.</i>

329
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:34,065
Because now I have
a washing machine

330
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:38,803
that doesn't bump, or quake or
travel halfway across the basement

331
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,811
when you put more than
three items in one load.

332
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,746
<i>I remember that. It
was, like, possessed.</i>

333
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:50,252
Because now
I have a dryer,

334
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,917
which is just
that. A dryer.

335
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,393
<i>A device
that removes</i>

336
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:02,092
<i>significant amounts of
moisture from clothing,</i>

337
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:07,127
and renders them completely
- not just partially - dry.

338
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,935
So, yes, my new washer and
dryer have made me very happy.

339
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:10,997
Okay.

340
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,668
I'm sorry.

341
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,079
Excuse me.

342
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,167
Morrie's always helped
you, hasn't he, Ida?

343
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:43,639
Every time you've called,
every six months or so.

344
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,136
I will pay him
back eventually.

345
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,772
You can pay
him back now.

346
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:54,012
Leave tomorrow, Ida.
Please. First thing.

347
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,677
Did you just
say that to me?

348
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:58,814
<i>I know, and I'm sorry.
But I know you understand.</i>

349
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,223
<i>How many years have you guys been
tiptoeing around Paul and Laura?</i>

350
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,125
<i>Is this my parents'
creme de menthe?</i>

351
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:07,164
I don't know. It was there when
Morrie and I started dating.

352
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,325
Morrie's a great teacher.

353
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,427
Paul is not gonna punish him
just because I came to see Jay.

354
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:15,871
Is that the only reason you
came? I mean, Ida, please.

355
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:19,377
<i>J ust please stay away from Gary's
for the next couple of weeks.</i>

356
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,843
He's really
been doing well.

357
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,174
He's finally
back up on...

358
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,545
his feet. You mean, back on his feet?

359
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,811
You were gonna say back on his feet.

360
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,979
It has been two years,
you never even called him.

361
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,990
If you mess with Gary now, if
you mess with Gary's engagement,

362
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:36,585
<i>Paul's already furious with Morrie.
That would just be it for us.</i>

363
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,629
Engagement?

364
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:42,599
Oh, sweetie. Oh,
surely you heard?

365
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,235
Gary is marrying
Ellen Thomas.

366
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:43,920
Thank you for the
smooth ride, officer.

367
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:52,831
What are you
doing here?

368
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:53,893
Who is that?

369
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,530
Will.

370
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:58,940
<i>Will who?</i>

371
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,535
Actually, I think
it was Phil.

372
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:05,208
It was Phil.
It was a Phil.

373
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:09,310
Sex. You should
try it, it's fun.

374
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,787
You know what
they say, Morrie?

375
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:16,156
<i>Everything in moderation,
including moderation.</i>

376
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:20,823
<i>Loosen your belt a bit.
Your robe. Loosen your robe.</i>

377
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,628
You don't
wanna see that.

378
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,635
I've seen it, but
that's not what I meant.

379
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,637
You've seen it.
When did you see it?

380
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,869
Jay and I used to look out the
window when you'd sneak out back,

381
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:34,639
and you'd go behind
the bush and, you know?

382
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,581
You need to think about
your behavior. It isn't safe.

383
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,814
You could get
tenure tomorrow,

384
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:48,348
after seven years of inhaling
Paul and Laura's farts,

385
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:51,520
<i>and get hit by
a meteor.</i>

386
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,461
Life is short.

387
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,260
<i>Life isn't
that short.</i>

388
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,494
<i>The average life span of a
male in North America is 70.</i>

389
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,662
What's the average life
span of this family?

390
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,567
I've chosen to plan
for my future.

391
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:09,011
As for fun, you and Jay can
keep living it up in ravines,

392
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,378
<i>and pretending to be
artists and photographers.</i>

393
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,746
I am
a photographer.

394
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,341
You look exhausted.

395
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,185
Well, I just haven't
been sleeping.

396
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:23,888
Anyway. Sorry about what I insinuated.

397
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:30,060
I'm sure that you and Betty
have a wonderful sex life.

398
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,330
We do have it.

399
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:52,916
I'm worried
about Jay.

400
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,926
How do you get run over
without breaking a bone?

401
00:29:55,994 --> 00:30:00,795
Carefully.

402
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:04,164
I don't want to have to, but he
could hurt himself or someone else.

403
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:08,296
Well, but
commit him?

404
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,773
He's not
mentally ill.

405
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,542
He's, he's
emotionally ill.

406
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,945
No, not ill.
He's disconnected.

407
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,246
Sometimes these things
run in families.

408
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,809
Except, Dad was not
crazy. Dad had an accident

409
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,219
and Dad was eccentric and so is Jay.

410
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,157
Dad was more
than eccentric.

411
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:31,195
<i># It's the story</i>

412
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,629
<i># Of faded glory #</i>

413
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,462
<i># Life is made up
of all that you lose ##</i>

414
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,399
Go to sleep.

415
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:39,959
Yes, Dad.

416
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,009
Ida?

417
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,538
<i>I find brains attractive</i>

418
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,733
<i>and the only
muscle that counts,</i>

419
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,639
<i>is this one.</i>

420
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,183
Oh!

421
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,257
Oh Lord!

422
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,364
I was
watching pornography.

423
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:10,782
<i>That was pretty
funny, huh? Lord I</i>

424
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,021
What's going on?

425
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,726
My clothes are
in the wash.

426
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,597
You were gettin'
kind of ripe.

427
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,572
Why were you lying
down on the road?

428
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:38,809
<i>You depressed?</i>

429
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,510
Like wanting to kill
yourself depressed?

430
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,746
No.

431
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,310
Sure?

432
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:55,822
When you're little,

433
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,765
you're clean.

434
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,998
<i>There's electricity
in your fingertips.</i>

435
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:05,600
And then, you,
you steel up,

436
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:09,840
<i>and pour shit
inside and...</i>

437
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:13,714
buy things and
God stockpiled us,

438
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,480
<i>already.</i>

439
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,613
I just don't want to wake
up and turn into that.

440
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,055
Morrie?

441
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:25,687
<i>We all have to take care of him.</i>

442
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:28,391
He's so
fucking fragile.

443
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:38,841
Hey, do you think you
need to be on something?

444
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:47,650
<i>Honey, if you're gonna live
totally outside the lines,</i>

445
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:52,815
all the people moving
on the inside of them

446
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,357
are gonna flatten you.

447
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:12,503
I think you
are a genius,

448
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,743
but you gotta
lighten up.

449
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,484
Oh,

450
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,720
Sunday's my birthday.

451
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,598
<i>Hey, you
still here?</i>

452
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,899
<i>It would appear so.</i>

453
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,839
<i>So, you got yourself
a full house now.</i>

454
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:46,308
Yeah. She came
in to see Jay.

455
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:50,541
<i>You poor guy. I heard her
roll in last night around 3.</i>

456
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:51,843
Sorry.

457
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,076
<i>You, I feel
bad for.</i>

458
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,345
<i>How old is
she now?</i>

459
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,215
She's gonna
be, wow, 32.

460
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:59,814
Phil Anderson can't be more than 22, 23.

461
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,291
So I guess you'll want to
cancel dinner Sunday night.

462
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,727
<i>No, no.
Of course...</i>

463
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,491
<i>Ida won't
be there.</i>

464
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,260
<i>You do what
you want, kiddo.</i>

465
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,769
<i>You're my best friend.
I just, uh, I love you.</i>

466
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,738
I love you, too.

467
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:20,505
I can't imagine she'd have
the gall to contact my brother.

468
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,068
No way.

469
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:25,013
<i>I know you'll see that
that doesn't happen but...</i>

470
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,141
having to still be the
grownup all the time.

471
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,184
That you? Let that genie
out of the bottle, big guy.

472
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,929
God damn it
to hell!

473
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,760
<i>Honey I It's okay.
It's okay I</i>

474
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,390
That's twice
today already.

475
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:46,197
We'll take care of it
after dinner. Now, let's go.

476
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:50,940
<i>I thought you were
going to change clothes.</i>

477
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,566
I washed these.

478
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,008
So, the weekend?

479
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:04,748
Yes. So, guys,
Betty and I,

480
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:08,986
would like to treat both of you
to dinner Sunday night at Shitake.

481
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,029
Yum. What's
the occasion?

482
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,894
Paul and Laura
are coming over.

483
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,827
So, you want us
to clear out.

484
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,235
<i>It's been set up for a
month. We have to do it.</i>

485
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,398
You don't mind,
do you?

486
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:26,102
Mm. I don't have to
clean up their shit.

487
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,287
Stop moving
your foot.

488
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:43,589
<i>She was the fifth child
accosted in a month.</i>

489
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,391
<i>Police are asking anyone with
information to contact authorities,</i>

490
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,830
<i>as the suspect is
still at large.</i>

491
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:51,367
<i>Maybe we don't have
to wait for tenure.</i>

492
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:55,030
Maybe we should
just start trying?

493
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,664
Sometimes it
takes a long time.

494
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,834
We have to
wait for tenure.

495
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,657
Honey.
Good morning.

496
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,564
Good morning. H i.
Time to get up.

497
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,760
Isn't it Sunday?

498
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,359
I know. We have
so much to do.

499
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,029
They're gonna be
here at 6: 30 and...

500
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,437
<i>we have to marinate and clean the garden</i>

501
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,806
<i>and I think some of the
stuff, where we've hung it,</i>

502
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,845
<i>is just not in
the right place.</i>

503
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:37,380
<i>Maybe we should just switch
it around in the living room?</i>

504
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,313
<i>But I'm not sure if I
have the right nails.</i>

505
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,214
<i>The ones that don't make the bad holes.</i>

506
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:51,859
Honey?

507
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,590
Can we redo
this someday?

508
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,598
<i>I like it.</i>

509
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,657
It's just
so obviously old.

510
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,166
Yeah.

511
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:14,515
How's a
hundred dollars?

512
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:15,813
That's too much.

513
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:19,151
I want you to have a nice dinner.

514
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,060
Thanks.

515
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:28,891
Bye.

516
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,661
Bye, sweetie.

517
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,602
No, oh! No.
Ah! Have fun!

518
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:44,772
Ah.
Oh.

519
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:57,627
You cannot tell Morrie,

520
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,663
but did you know

521
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,893
that he was born with a little
teeny, tiny vestigial tail?

522
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:07,861
He was not.

523
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,462
Ah, Mom told me.

524
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,666
It happens once
in a while.

525
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,141
It was an inch
and a half long.

526
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,871
She swore to me!

527
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:21,406
She did. She swore it to me.

528
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:26,479
They had to have
it removed surgically.

529
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,252
Too bad he
didn't keep it.

530
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:34,030
At least we would have
known when he was happy.

531
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:38,933
So I look over and the kid is covered
head to toe in strained carrots.

532
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,198
Ten seconds I didn't have my eye on him.

533
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,035
Can I top you off
there, young lady?

534
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,768
I don't want to
get Brandon drunk.

535
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,241
No.

536
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,334
These are
so good!

537
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,402
Thank you!
It's real limes.

538
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,244
Maybe just a little
more. It shouldn't hurt.

539
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:53,943
Time to light
the eternal flame.

540
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,410
<i>Hello?
Anyone here?</i>

541
00:40:57,488 --> 00:41:00,321
H i. Can
I help you?

542
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,451
Yeah, I need to find
Jay. Is he here?

543
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:06,621
Sweetie, Jay isn't
here right now.

544
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,597
Pop around tomorrow.
We'll give him a message.

545
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,031
Who should I say?

546
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,624
H is wife.

547
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,799
<i>But I can't pop
around tomorrow.</i>

548
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,533
<i>I hitched from
the city,</i>

549
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:19,167
<i>and I need to see him
tonight. It's important.</i>

550
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,938
Well, I'm sure whatever
it is could wait.

551
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:24,139
You don't understand.

552
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,615
The cops are
looking for him.

553
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,879
<i>They want his D NA.</i>

554
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,080
That's absurd. Why would they want that?

555
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,647
They said he got arrested last
week for touching a little girl.

556
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,362
Let's go.

557
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,896
Oh my.

558
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,338
Okay.

559
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,709
She is not
staying here.

560
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:01,740
We don't need to put Jay in an
institution. This is an institution.

561
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:05,016
She'll just stay here until we
talk to Jay and clear things up.

562
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:09,526
Whoa, clear what? We're fucked!
We're totally fucking fucked!

563
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:13,188
<i>How many years have we been
kissing their asses, and for what?</i>

564
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,165
Did you see their faces
as they ran for cover?

565
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:20,192
We're pariahs. We're totally
fucked. Fucking pariahs.

566
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,933
<i>Okay, the big issue
right now is Jay.</i>

567
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:27,774
No! The issue is me,
for once. It's me.

568
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,313
I don't even know how
many eggs I have left.

569
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,144
Eggs?
Oh.

570
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,150
Oh, God. It's the last
thing on your mind.

571
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,207
<i>Calm down.</i>

572
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:36,548
No, I'm not
calming down.

573
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,349
I am going
to Nancy Kennedy's,

574
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:41,220
and I do not want you to
try to stop me so shut up.

575
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,316
Are you...

576
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,725
Shut up!
I'm taking the car!

577
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:52,758
I don't think
he's in there.

578
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:53,928
Is she...

579
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:56,734
in there? That is the question.

580
00:42:56,807 --> 00:43:00,402
I think it's safe
to go home. Now.

581
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,277
Hey,

582
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,044
do you ever wonder if Paul
bought the house next to ours

583
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,812
'cause he has a
thing for Morrie?

584
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,224
<i>Here.</i>

585
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:19,387
Thank you.

586
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:30,396
<i>So, how long have you
and Jay been married?</i>

587
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:33,500
Six months
and three days.

588
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,444
It's not going
so great, though.

589
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:43,509
Well, all marriages
have their difficulties.

590
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:46,385
<i>He stopped having
sex a couple months ago.</i>

591
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:50,587
He said "All desire
leads to suffering. "

592
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,858
<i>Then he stopped talking.
Only wrote notes.</i>

593
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:58,391
And then he gave that up
and moved to the ravine.

594
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,438
Well, maybe not the
same difficulties.

595
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:04,474
I really,
really miss him.

596
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:08,568
I'm pretty sure he
never molested that kid.

597
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:14,383
<i>It's late.
Where were you?</i>

598
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:17,215
<i>It's eleven.
What's wrong?</i>

599
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,016
Your wife
is here.

600
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,886
<i>Wife?</i>

601
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:25,895
She said you're under suspicion
for sexual assault of a child.

602
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,897
Where's Gillian?

603
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:31,867
Passed out in your old room.
Did you know they want your D NA?

604
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:34,096
It's gotta be a mix up. Jay? Jay?

605
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,695
What's going on?

606
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,263
Hey! Come back
here, young man.

607
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,672
We have to sort
this out, honey.

608
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:40,334
You come back down
here this instant.

609
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:43,810
Wife?

610
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:46,941
He has completely...

611
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,950
<i>What are we
supposed to do?</i>

612
00:44:56,026 --> 00:45:00,895
We have to call the cops. We
have to find his old shrink.

613
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:04,058
I can't take another
situation in this family.

614
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:05,965
Oh, we're back at
Dad's accident again.

615
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,833
You cannot fall
out of that window.

616
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,270
It was snowing.

617
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,830
<i>Snow doesn't suck
people out of windows.</i>

618
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,467
He was trying
to fix something.

619
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,273
What needed
to be fixed?

620
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:19,145
No, he had a leak!
He had leaks.

621
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,013
<i>He was trying to shoo
a bat out the window.</i>

622
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:23,713
He jumped!

623
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,345
On his head.

624
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:29,188
No. He would never have
wanted us to see him like that.

625
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,591
He wasn't thinking.
He had shut down.

626
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:32,651
You'd know
more than...

627
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,788
Me?

628
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:36,526
<i>Any of us.</i>

629
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,931
You meant me.

630
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:54,480
I wish they were here.

631
00:45:58,455 --> 00:45:59,683
Go to bed.
It's late.

632
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,054
Yes, Dad.

633
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:06,392
No, don't. I was Dad. So don't say that.

634
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:08,522
I know.

635
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,157
You think I wanted...

636
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:14,034
<i>No. I know you didn't
want to take care of us.</i>

637
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,833
It's not that.

638
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:19,740
<i>Yes, it is, Morrie. It is
that. That is the thing.</i>

639
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,938
<i>So say it. Say the truth for once.</i>

640
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:24,947
It's not gonna blow the
world to smithereens.

641
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,744
You don't have
that kind of power.

642
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,446
Goodnight.
I love you.

643
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:34,718
I love you.

644
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,036
Morrie?

645
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,136
What?

646
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,645
Look what I found
in Jay's wallet.

647
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,978
It's a baseball card.

648
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,812
He didn't give
everything away.

649
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,648
Somewhere in there
he's still Jay.

650
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,711
He's still connected.

651
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,016
What are we doing?

652
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:19,056
U h, we just remembered
that today is my birthday,

653
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:22,326
<i>and as a special
birthday gift to me,</i>

654
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:26,301
I was hoping that you guys
would smoke this joint with me.

655
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,604
Okay.

656
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:51,184
<i>The condensed version
of Manifest Destiny.</i>

657
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,252
Paul and Laura
gave that to us.

658
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,992
<i>What could
we give them?</i>

659
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:59,263
Gonorrhea.

660
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:10,178
You know whatever happens
we're still going to love you.

661
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,002
We need a
birthday toast.

662
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,174
<i>I'm gonna go see
what we have.</i>

663
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:33,323
You know,
it's funny.

664
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:37,590
<i>My wife is gone,</i>

665
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:41,660
and your wife is
upstairs sleeping.

666
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:48,506
I mean, not
"ha ha" funny.

667
00:50:58,688 --> 00:50:59,848
<i>Those Dad's?</i>

668
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,987
Time to kill this fucker.

669
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:13,127
<i>I can't believe
you have a wife.</i>

670
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,339
<i>When were you
gonna tell us?</i>

671
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,169
<i>There's nothing
to tell, really.</i>

672
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:21,335
She wanted to get
married so I married her.

673
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,106
She seems nice.

674
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,579
<i>She is nice.</i>

675
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,715
But she's kind
of dopey.

676
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:31,083
<i>Don't say that
about your wife.</i>

677
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:32,485
It's true.

678
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:35,650
Mm, But, sometimes,

679
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:42,489
sometimes kindness is
wiser than truth.

680
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:47,266
Khalil Gibran.

681
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,037
Columbo.

682
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,173
Lieutenant Columbo?

683
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:59,575
I don't know why, I always
remembered that line.

684
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:07,912
To Ida.

685
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:10,524
<i>Happy birthday, sis.</i>

686
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:30,040
It has been months...

687
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:33,947
since I've had
a bowel movement.

688
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:35,951
That's a
true story.

689
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,477
Hey. Where
you going?

690
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:06,015
Going to see my woman, bring her home.

691
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:07,913
<i>Morrie,</i>

692
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:15,725
maybe Dad was sad 'cause Mom was sick.

693
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:30,864
Since when have you
had trouble sleeping?

694
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:33,273
Two years ago.

695
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:35,174
Oh.

696
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:38,646
No, not that.

697
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:42,446
No, before.
When I left.

698
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,821
You're not going
to see him?

699
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,489
Jesus you can't wait a
month? I'll have tenure then.

700
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:55,690
Gary will
be married.

701
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:57,323
Are you serious?

702
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,732
Settling down here was
too dull for you.

703
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:02,966
Life with Gary now would be less
fun than it was two years ago.

704
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,301
Fun isn't
fun anymore.

705
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:05,966
Shh!

706
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:08,169
How long are you going to let
Paul give you purple nurples?

707
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,681
You remember that?
You remember the bruises?

708
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:30,126
It's like having sex
with The Mummy.

709
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:36,730
Ahh!

710
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:39,206
Pooks, did
you miss me?

711
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,641
Mm.

712
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:47,710
What? I thought we were going
to be honest with each other?

713
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:33,321
<i>Hey, are
you okay?</i>

714
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:36,524
I'll get your mom.
It's just Mr. Csonka...

715
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:39,534
come to... say hi.

716
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:43,102
What are you doing?
Why are you wet?

717
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,973
I guess the Morrisons got an
automatic sprinkler system.

718
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:49,807
Go home before
somebody sees you.

719
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,608
I need to
talk to you.

720
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,308
Not... not now.

721
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:54,941
I need to
talk to you.

722
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:01,049
I want you
to come home.

723
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,461
I love you.

724
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,223
I love you, too.

725
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:12,290
Okay.

726
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,604
I don't wanna
wait anymore.

727
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:19,574
Let's start our family.

728
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:22,202
I don't care if you
get tenure or not.

729
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:25,213
I thought we agreed that we needed

730
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:30,981
<i>a more stable and secure environment
before we embarked on all of that.</i>

731
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,682
<i>I'm doing all of
this for you.</i>

732
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:34,746
I know.

733
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,827
But I just want
to be a mom.

734
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:46,096
<i>Oh, God. This hasn't all
been an excuse, has it?</i>

735
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:47,966
Don't you want to have children with me?

736
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:52,531
Yes. Of course I do.
It's not that. I'm just...

737
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:57,840
I'm a...

738
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,178
We can manage.

739
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,219
No, it's not
that. It's...

740
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:06,653
everything. My
father and Jay.

741
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:12,161
I just wish there was some
kind of prenatal screening.

742
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:14,924
But you can't screen for
what happens in this family.

743
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:16,556
No, you can't.

744
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:28,173
Maybe you're not ready.

745
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:31,941
Maybe you should
go off and have...

746
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:35,041
your insane youth, 'cause
you never got to have it.

747
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:41,251
Well, I never
thought of that.

748
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:42,313
<i>You should.</i>

749
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:43,381
Okay.

750
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:47,821
Well, you'll
let me know.

751
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:48,886
<i>Honey?</i>

752
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,057
No, just...

753
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,760
let me know
when you're ready.

754
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:54,303
L... I said okay.
Can you just wait?

755
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:55,735
I've been waiting.

756
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:40,438
No, don't get up.

757
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:47,990
Do you wanna come in?

758
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:49,786
Mm-hm.

759
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:28,055
You took down
the photos I did.

760
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:36,027
You look good.

761
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:38,801
<i>You do.</i>

762
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,740
<i>You look
really good.</i>

763
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,074
How's your brother?

764
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:44,511
Jay?

765
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,778
<i>Yeah, I heard he was
cracking up a bit.</i>

766
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:51,115
Yeah.

767
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:53,985
Who isn't cracking
up a bit? I know I am.

768
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:59,555
So, listen. There's
something I have to tell you.

769
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:00,618
<i>Don't worry
about it.</i>

770
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:01,686
<i>Ye- no. Please.</i>

771
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,893
It's important.
U m,

772
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:08,665
<i>a couple months
after I left, I...</i>

773
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:12,105
<i>uh, I realized I
shouldn't have.</i>

774
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:16,839
I mean, I was thinking
about coming back...

775
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:22,717
<i>and, uh, I was
just about to call...</i>

776
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:30,785
and then I was afraid to come back
'cause I thought that you'd think that,

777
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:34,091
that I was just coming
back because of that.

778
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:40,068
<i>Out of, like, guilt
or pity or something.</i>

779
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,730
And I thought, I
thought you'd hate that.

780
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:49,041
The thing is, I thought for
sure you'd come back after.

781
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:52,309
Every time the door to
my room would open I,

782
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:54,475
I always expected
it to be you.

783
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:57,951
I know. I know. I should have.

784
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:02,219
I should have.
I wish I had.

785
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:05,454
I was really looking forward
to telling you to fuck off.

786
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:10,292
Oh... Yeah.

787
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:14,296
Yeah, I guess.

788
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:17,930
Anyway.

789
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,181
It's okay. It's okay.
Hey. Sh, sh, sh. It's okay.

790
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:30,082
It's okay.

791
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:34,180
Oh.

792
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:45,329
Hey. Sh sh sh. Hey.

793
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:47,631
I'm sorry.

794
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:51,729
I love you.

795
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:57,973
Do you hate me?

796
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,288
Hey. Hey.

797
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:45,552
Fuck!

798
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:48,987
Keys? Did you
see my keys?

799
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,264
Don't leave.
I need your help.

800
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:55,964
I don't need your help. I
don't know what I'm saying.

801
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:05,877
<i>Don't leave.</i>

802
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,355
Coming through!

803
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:30,296
Good morning. Thanks
for waiting. Sorry.

804
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:34,941
Okay. For every action,

805
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:39,277
there is an equal
and opposite reaction.

806
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:44,742
Yeah.

807
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:55,589
Well, look who
finally made it.

808
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:58,634
Rough morning.
Car trouble.

809
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:01,895
So, a couple things.

810
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,300
First...

811
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:08,104
we felt, I'm sorry, we had
to alert the authorities...

812
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:11,806
<i>as to Jay's whereabouts.
J ust in case.</i>

813
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,439
Sure.

814
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:17,748
Someone has to protect the
innocent and vulnerable.

815
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,550
Second, do you know where your
little sister was this morning?

816
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:23,148
<i>I'm pretty sure she was at Gary's.</i>

817
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:26,718
I drove by on my way in and
I saw her car parked in front.

818
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:28,696
I would've stopped but
I didn't want to be late.

819
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:30,857
My lateness this
morning was unavoidable.

820
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:31,922
I'm just...

821
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,935
It won't
happen again.

822
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:36,267
Your lateness
is secondary.

823
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:38,307
What do you want
me to say, Paul?

824
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:41,537
<i>You said you would ensure that
Ida stayed away from my brother.</i>

825
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:44,978
I'm just disappointed. I
trusted you. We're friends.

826
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,709
I could consider you my best
friend. I don't know what you think.

827
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:51,446
<i>You didn't deliver and that says
something about your character.</i>

828
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:55,456
I'm sorry, but I can't control Ida.

829
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:58,084
She's an adult
and so is Gary,

830
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,357
and even if Ida went over there,
I'm sure he could handle it.

831
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,591
No, he can't. Okay? She's poison to him.

832
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:06,134
She's already smashed
his life to shit once.

833
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:08,534
Okay, I'm getting
a little tired

834
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:11,801
of Ida being blamed for
what happened to Gary.

835
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:13,136
Oh, you are?

836
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:16,701
<i>Yeah. Gary chose
to get hammered...</i>

837
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:19,111
and drive his car
100 miles an hour.

838
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,115
How is that
Ida's fault?

839
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:23,048
He wouldn't have done it if
she hadn't taken off on him

840
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,246
like some
wanton slut.

841
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:30,190
Okay, don't... don't talk
about my little sister that way.

842
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,658
Come on, you
know it's true.

843
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:33,354
Ida's always been
a total tramp.

844
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:38,594
What Ida does says
nothing about my character.

845
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:43,071
What Gary does says nothing
about Ida's character.

846
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:48,236
There is such a thing in America
as personal responsibility.

847
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:49,972
You know what?

848
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:53,470
You know what?

849
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:55,408
Ow!

850
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:57,384
Take it back.
Take it all back.

851
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:58,681
Ow!

852
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:00,244
Is that what
you like?

853
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:03,053
Ow, ow! Fine! I
take it back! Ah!

854
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:06,686
<i>You're fuckin'
psychotic, pal.</i>

855
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:09,856
J ust like the rest
of your sicko family.

856
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:11,422
Yes, but we're
nicer than you.

857
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,024
What the fuck!

858
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:17,038
Someone has to protect the
vulnerable and the innocent!

859
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:37,659
<i>Hey.</i>

860
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:40,992
H i, Ida.
How are you?

861
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:42,997
Ellen, I'm sorry. I must
have nodded off a bit.

862
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:44,362
No worries.

863
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:46,901
Would you like some
coffee? Are you hungry?

864
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:48,334
No, I have to run.

865
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:50,497
Are you sure?

866
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:54,134
Well, it's nice to
see you. You look good.

867
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,337
Thanks.
Congratulations.

868
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:58,073
Oh! Thank
you, thanks.

869
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:02,140
<i>And you too. I heard you're
a big photographer now.</i>

870
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:05,483
No, no.
Not really.

871
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:07,419
I heard that, too.

872
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:11,153
<i>Oh. I've been exaggerating
to Morrie about some stuff.</i>

873
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:12,717
Oh, yeah?

874
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:14,319
I still take photos...

875
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:16,331
and I exhibit here and
there, but to pay the bills...

876
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,993
<i>I survive doing glamor
shots of transvestites.</i>

877
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:21,467
Seriously?

878
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,698
I did one for a friend,
and word spread, so...

879
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:25,331
Well, that's alright.

880
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,603
Yeah, it
sounds interesting.

881
01:07:27,676 --> 01:07:30,042
Anyway, I
should go.

882
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:32,512
Oh, wait. I have
something for you.

883
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:34,845
<i>If we'd have known you
were gonna be in town,</i>

884
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:37,545
<i>we would have
sent it earlier.</i>

885
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,247
I really hope
you can make it.

886
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:48,153
It's so nice
of you to offer.

887
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:51,165
I think I'm gonna
be gone by then.

888
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:53,895
Anyway, I don't think Paul
and Laura would approve.

889
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:57,530
Well, it isn't Paul and
Laura's wedding, is it?

890
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:59,039
So, tough shit
for them.

891
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:00,905
Right, baby?

892
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:01,965
Exactly right.

893
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,304
I really have to run.

894
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,411
<i>U h-oh,
Spaghetti-o's.</i>

895
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:54,255
Jay! No!

896
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:02,192
Jay!

897
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:03,568
Hey!

898
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,937
No! Please, God!

899
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:09,371
No! Go around!
Go around!

900
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,254
<i>Well, I didn't
want to do that.</i>

901
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:26,794
I mean, sometimes
I like to, but...

902
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:29,330
I don't want
him to check.

903
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:32,799
You know, I could watch, maybe,
but it didn't seem like...

904
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:36,065
I, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

905
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:57,940
Okay! Good!
Don't move!

906
01:11:58,013 --> 01:12:01,608
<i>He's not moving.
Please put the gun down.</i>

907
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:03,584
Ida?

908
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:04,641
Will?

909
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,211
It's Phil.
How you doin'?

910
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:09,120
I had a great time
the other night.

911
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:14,254
<i>Would you mind terribly calling
us an ambulance, please? Phil.</i>

912
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:24,564
<i>Hi, if you have
a message</i>

913
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,437
<i>for Joe, or Nancy
or Misha Kennedy,</i>

914
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,567
<i>leave it
at the...</i>

915
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:31,511
<i>Honey, it's me.</i>

916
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:35,380
Okay, I had it.
My insane youth.

917
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:38,150
<i>I hated it.</i>

918
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:41,655
<i>Please come home.</i>

919
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:53,293
Foot.

920
01:12:58,273 --> 01:12:59,831
<i>So, what did
they say?</i>

921
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:01,705
Put ice on it.

922
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:03,267
You have to keep it clean.

923
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:06,109
No, what did
the police say?

924
01:13:06,181 --> 01:13:09,116
They asked me
some questions.

925
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:12,347
They took
a D NA swab.

926
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:14,184
They're
doing everybody,

927
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:15,621
<i>it's not just me.</i>

928
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:16,851
<i>Then why
did you run?</i>

929
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:18,222
<i>Habit?</i>

930
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:19,487
<i>Everybody and
their grandmother</i>

931
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:23,019
weren't arrested
last week for...

932
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:25,828
Why don't you tell us what happened?

933
01:13:29,772 --> 01:13:31,501
I touched a
little girl.

934
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:40,948
I had this idea that
I was gonna touch people.

935
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:42,916
I did touch people.

936
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:24,417
<i>What the hell
are you...?</i>

937
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,231
<i>The cops came.</i>

938
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:36,794
I went to the hospital.
They gave me stitches.

939
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,507
But because Momma Bear
gave me such a concussion,

940
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:44,205
I had to stay
up all night.

941
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:47,009
So, in the morning I
went for a walk,

942
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:49,209
and that's when
I laid down.

943
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:50,751
And you were
really out of it.

944
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:53,151
I'm relieved that you're
not a child molester

945
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:55,520
but you can't just go
around touching people?

946
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:57,286
People need
to be jolted.

947
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:00,658
No, people need
to be comforted.

948
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:04,563
You don't comfort them by satisfying
your own curiosity about...

949
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:09,661
breaking down boundaries and rules.
Some people really like their rules.

950
01:15:09,738 --> 01:15:11,569
They've chosen them.

951
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:16,600
And you don't get to choose what rules
other people obey or not. They do.

952
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:28,513
You see? This
is what I mean.

953
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:31,616
This is exactly what
I'm talking about.

954
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:35,595
They are breaking my rules.
They are breaking my boundaries!

955
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:38,792
And you... you are
just like them, Jay.

956
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:42,564
<i>You are a terrorist and
I am sick of everyonel</i>

957
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:43,866
Agh!

958
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:45,634
Are you okay?

959
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:48,904
<i>Morrie?</i>

960
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:53,303
Morrie?

961
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:05,852
No...

962
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:15,899
<i>Let it gol
Morrie, let it gol</i>

963
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:33,618
Please.
Please.

964
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:50,870
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

965
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,406
What is it?

966
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:56,410
Oh! Ew!

967
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:58,912
Morrie did that.

968
01:16:58,981 --> 01:16:59,970
Excuse me?

969
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:02,710
Morrie just...

970
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:03,944
did that
on my lawn.

971
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:05,281
What?

972
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:06,981
Morrie just shat on my lawn.

973
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:08,682
No.

974
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:11,885
Yes. And he attacked Paul at
school today. He went cra-crazy.

975
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,689
He did?

976
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:16,856
He's sick, honey,

977
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:21,028
and now, I, I
don't blame you but

978
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:23,970
someone needs to
clean that up.

979
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:29,409
I need you or Morrie to
clean that up. Please.

980
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:34,780
I n the next ten minutes.
I, I just can't. Oh.

981
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,818
Fuck off, Laura.

982
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:38,375
What?

983
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:42,450
You clean it up.

984
01:17:43,892 --> 01:17:45,450
Oh no!

985
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:48,660
Why?

986
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:17,140
How is it?

987
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:30,430
Perfect.

988
