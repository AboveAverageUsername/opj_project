THE CONVOY

17
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,200
Hey, old man, where you going?

18
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,250
What's the matter?
- What'd you do with it?

19
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,290
Hi.
- I said, why throw the bottle?

20
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,690
Why did you smash the bottle?

21
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,530
Call the cops!
He'll kill him!

22
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,050
Jail, old man. You're gonna get
banged up! Cool down!

23
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,890
Tanya!

24
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,120
Tanya!

25
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,000
Tanya!

26
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,570
Does it hurt?

27
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,890
Where?
- Here.

28
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,330
No, not here it doesn't.

29
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,040
The fainting spells will continue
if you keep ignoring the pain.

30
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,040
There's no cure for migraines,
but you do have to control the pain.

31
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,650
Take these with water.

32
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:44,090
If it hits you, take a bath.
Hot water will stop it for a while.

33
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,440
Stop ignoring the pain, Ignat.

34
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,120
You'll start hallucinating.
Seeing things.

35
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,410
If you keep refusing preventive measures,
I'll report you to the regiment.

36
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,320
I won't.

37
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,370
Comrade Captain, those little brats
wrote a complaint to the precinct

38
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,880
and attached a doctor's note.

39
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,770
You broke this punk's bone,
and messed up his Adam's apple.

40
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,480
The higher-ups are stricter these days.
You know how it is.

41
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,680
Everyone is sick of disorderly conduct.

42
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,530
Were you drunk or something?
- I'm not apologizing.

43
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,970
You're going on detached duty, Ignat,
AWOL retrieval.

44
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,720
Two newbies took off,
and stole cash from the office.

45
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,930
The soldiers aren't armed; fuck 'em.

46
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,530
We're not gonna raise hell.
Who needs that?

47
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:03,010
But it's government money.
We have to get it back.

48
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,080
I'm assigning you a contract sergeant.

49
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,850
He's waiting for you.

50
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,410
Lay low on detached duty, Ignat.
Wait this out and keep your nose clean.

51
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,050
Understand about the money?
- Yes, sir.

52
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,930
You're going to the AWOL's place of
residence, with a layover in Moscow.

53
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,800
Moscow. Got it.

54
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,450
Don't fuck this up,
Comrade Captain,

55
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,330
one more stunt,
and I'll throw the book at you.

56
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,090
Guaranteed dishonourable
discharge, maybe even worse.

57
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,770
A criminal case.

58
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,530
I'm sick of disorderly conduct.

59
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,480
Permission to speak,
Comrade Captain?

60
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,770
The boys want to know, " Why doesn't
Comrade Captain shave himself?"

61
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,530
They're, like, going on about how
Comrade Captain could cut his throat, like.

62
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,770
"Comrade Captain
can't feel pain".

63
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,960
I think that's bullshit,
Comrade Captain.

64
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,360
I think once you draw blood,
your hand stops by itself.

65
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,450
With a blade, Comrade Captain,
everyone feels pain.

66
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,450
I'm sorry, Comrade Captain.

67
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,290
Good day, Comrade Captain.

68
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,890
They've found Timofeyev, the first AWOL.
The cops are setting up a local raid.

69
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,610
We should go pick him up,
before it's too late.

70
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,800
Should we take guns, Comrade Captain?

71
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,970
What's going on here?

72
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,490
That's what.
- Whatcha waiting for? Call an ambulance.

73
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,160
Stabbed with an awl.
Ran him through, the bastard.

74
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,440
The fucker's hiding up there.
- An athlete, eh?

75
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,680
Timofeyev went nuts,
Comrade Captain.

76
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,730
This is a murder; what can we do?
Let the cops deal with it.

77
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,400
We could use a sniper.
- Nah, not necessary.

78
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,770
Did I get him, Comrade Captain?

79
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,450
With one hit.

80
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,200
A steady arm can come in handy.

81
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,770
Don't get me wrong, Comrade Captain,
I'm not a violent man.

82
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,610
The cop was a piece of shit.

83
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,640
He wouldn't have lived long anyway.

84
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,970
Didn't even know me
and was mouthing off at me.

85
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,090
Started talking about my mother.

86
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,730
That scum tried to humiliate me.
I wasn't having that.

87
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,930
You sure he's dead, Comrade Captain?

88
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,770
Give me the awl, Timofeyev. If the riot
police find out, they'll take you down.

89
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,970
Think I'm a shit?
- You tell me.

90
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,970
I'm not gonna die alone.

91
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,850
You're not gonna kill me.

92
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,410
You think it's not in me?

93
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,320
You take me down, who's gonna
protect you from the cops?

94
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,330
What, like there are no cops in jail?
- You won't live to see remand.

95
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,170
Fine, here it is then.

96
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,290
You stole money. You have to give
it back to the government.

97
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,970
Nineteen thousand.
Spent half of it on grub.

98
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,690
Where's your friend?
- He's not my friend. He's a clown.

99
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,200
Why is he a clown?
- Shrieks like a bird.

100
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,090
And where's he shrieking now?

101
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,610
No way, Comrade Captain.
You really think I'm a shit.

102
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,690
Get in my car now.

103
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:55,730
I killed a cop. The cops are gonna get me.
In prison, I'm dead either way.

104
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,850
Listen, Captain,
give the money to my mum.

105
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,930
So she can pray for my soul.
- It's the government's money.

106
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,970
You stole it.
I have to sign for it.

107
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,920
It was a good hit, eh?
- No, it wasn't.

108
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,520
You're all fucked. Bitches.

109
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,450
Turned out to be a smart kid.
Saved everyone a lot of hassle.

110
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,680
Nice one, pal.
You saw the kid alive last?

111
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,370
What can you tell me?
- Nothing.

112
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,320
Did he ask you anything?
Hey, bro, did he?

113
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,330
I'm not your bro, pig?

114
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,370
What did you say? Hey!
Hey, come back here.

115
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,050
Get off your high horse, Sergeant.
We identified Timofeyev's body.

116
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,130
I'll sign whatever you want.

117
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,370
If I find out the soldier
didn't jump, I'll come after you.

118
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,200
The boys fight for cash in the barracks,
saving up for demobilization.

119
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,290
A hundred to whoever remains standing.
Timofeyev was the biggest thug.

120
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,650
Stomped one of our boys half to death.
Sent him to the hospital, broke his arm.

121
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,970
Ruptured his spleen, the bastard.
Timofeyev was asking for it.

122
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,370
Don't worry about it, Comrade Captain.
He got what he deserved.

123
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,640
You want a reprimand?

124
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,400
A reprimand? A reprimand would
fuck up my whole contract.

125
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,920
The paymaster would start
getting tight with the money.

126
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,370
No, you don't get it.

127
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,450
Of course I get it.

128
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,450
Eyes on the road.

129
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,450
Can I sit here?

130
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,850
Here, the stool is better.

131
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,930
Hand over the deserter.
- We already did that once.

132
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,930
Unauthorized absence from the unit
means up to four years in prison.

133
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:06,210
Let's make a deal. The commander
will turn a blind eye.

134
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,520
Tugayev will finish his service
and go home.

135
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,530
I was telling Artyom not to enlist.

136
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,810
But he did anyway.

137
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:29,575
You got it into his head, fuckwit.
"A boy has a duty..."

138
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:34,400
Kept saying, "You'll come back a man".
- It was Artyom's decision.

139
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,650
I told him, " Don't enlist.

140
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,330
It's hell. Don't stick your neck
into the noose".

141
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,650
But he did it anyway!
Now look; he's AWOL.

142
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,240
He did the right thing
- The right thing?! What right thing?!

143
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,280
Artyom made his choice.

144
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,370
Why couldn't he choose his mother?

145
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:58,410
Why? I told him,
"Get a doctor's note".

146
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,410
Didn't I tell him?

147
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,370
That's right, Captain,
Don't look for my son here.

148
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,130
Come here.

149
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:22,080
What are you doing?
Don't touch that bed.

150
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,440
Just leave my mother alone.

151
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:56,330
Meat pies?
- With these prices...

152
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,770
...be glad to get those.
- It's good.

153
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,770
Good thing we're leaving tonight.

154
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,280
You'd spend all the
government's cash on grub.

155
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,640
Forget the pies, Comrade Captain.
We have money.

156
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,090
You know, Timofeyev's money.
It's nobody's money.

157
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,650
Don't be afraid of the brass,
Comrade Captain.

158
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,850
They already reported the money
as lost.

159
00:17:14,885 --> 00:17:16,810
They already wrote it off.

160
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,760
We can go out on the town,
burn some cash. Cool, huh?

161
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:24,610
A whole day in Moscow.
Something to tell the guys about.

162
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,130
You can't do Moscow with no money.

163
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,170
We could see the city,
Comrade Captain; look around.

164
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,640
You like Moscow?
- The city would be mine by nightfall.

165
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,930
When your contract's done,
knock yourself out.

166
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,480
Here, have a pie.

167
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,930
First time in Moscow?

168
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,360
What about you?
- No, not me.

169
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,850
Here.

170
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,650
Nah, that shit does nothing for me.

171
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,530
Moscow is like a whore:
You need a warm-up.

172
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,050
Let me go.

173
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,530
No, nothing I can do.

174
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,570
The boss will look the other way,
I know the secret way to ask.

175
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,250
The captain won't go for it.

176
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,120
I can't go back to the barracks.
I'll go crazy.

177
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,890
No, there's nothing I can do.

178
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,410
Think about it, bro:
Once you jump the fence,

179
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,250
you can't go back, it's hell.

180
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,170
Once you've been AWOL,
you're screwed, you know?

181
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,970
Get off my back.
- What did I say?

182
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,930
A load of crap. The captain's brutal,
he's facing criminal charges.

183
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,130
Drunk and disorderly?
- Murder, but not proved yet.

184
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,930
Premeditated murder?

185
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,960
The boys say he killed his daughter.

186
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,530
His own daughter?

187
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,440
He'll get you too, bro.

188
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,970
Let me go, bro.
Don't push me. I'll get mad.

189
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,210
Go ahead
- Yeah? I could, y'know...

190
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,010
Whatever. It's just...
- Just what?

191
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,410
Just, you don't have the balls.
- I can leave.

192
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,960
Again, huh?
- What?

193
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,770
You're scared again.
- I'm not scared.

194
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,690
Thought I was wasted, right?
Thought I was nice?

195
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,640
Lay off, you'll get yourself dirty.
- Thought I'd take pity on you?

196
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,440
Don't touch shit, you'll stink.

197
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,690
Jail doesn't do shit for your kind.
People like you should be killed.

198
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,050
I swear, the captain'll turn a blind eye,
I know a secret.

199
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,290
Damn Moscow!

200
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,480
It's not working, Comrade Captain?

201
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,850
Give me your hands.

202
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,090
Take them off.

203
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:20,840
Why, Comrade Captain?
The cops will sniff around.

204
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,530
Down. Pushups.
- What do you mean, down?

205
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,890
You don't get it.
- What, in a public toilet?

206
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,320
You don't get it.
- You mean, hands on the ground?

207
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,170
No, you don't get it.

208
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,410
One, two, three,

209
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:44,650
four, five, six,

210
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,290
seven, eight, nine,

211
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,090
ten, eleven...

212
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,290
You hurt yourself?
- No, Comrade Captain.

213
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,650
It's the pies. Bad for my stomach.
- Did you know that before?

214
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah.
- Then why'd you stuff your face?

215
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,850
It hurts. I need a doctor.

216
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,720
What the hell?
- Good ketchup.

217
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,770
You'll have to lick it up.

218
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,250
Get up.

219
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:40,730
What's with you?

220
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:43,170
What about him?
- Eyes front.

221
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,370
What's this?

222
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,520
Ketchup, Comrade Captain.
Disgusting shit.

223
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,730
You're disgusting shit.
Need proof?

224
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,840
Permission to clean myself up,
Comrade Captain?

225
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,450
Forward march.

226
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,440
You got eyes like a bull,
Comrade Captain.

227
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,610
Don't red flies bother you?

228
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,330
Why didn't you tell me
the sergeant attacked you?

229
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,850
He didn't.

230
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,250
Tanya!

231
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,290
Tanya...

232
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,000
I told you, he's a goner.

233
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,250
I'm watching you, bitch.

234
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,770
Why didn't you run away?

235
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,410
Give me your hands.

236
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,250
What's this concerning,
Comrade Captain?

237
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,560
I need to file a report.
Absence without leave.

238
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,010
Don't report the sergeant. They'll
hold you responsible for the money.

239
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,290
They'll fuck you up, for sure.

240
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,960
I never touched the money,
and I'm still getting screwed.

241
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:56,400
Imagine, the two of us in the same cell,
Comrade Captain, like brothers.

242
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,810
What money, Comrade Captain?

243
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,290
I'm hungry.

244
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:43,610
Why didn't you run?
- Didn't have the time. That's it.

245
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,970
Damn sergeant spends everything on grub.
I could, too.

246
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,650
You chickened out.

247
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,880
No, I told you, I wanted to run
but missed my chance.

248
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:00,600
My mother always said, " Tell a good
joke, and the hunger will go away".

249
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,840
What do you think,
Comrade Captain, will it go away?

250
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,570
What do you think?

251
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,010
Wanna hear a joke about meat pies?

252
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,730
Shut up.

253
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,250
Come to pick a fight?

254
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,640
Do you serve friendly forces?

255
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,970
Always.

256
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,850
A thousand roubles.
A grand for half a litre?

257
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,000
Do you drink?
- No.

258
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,410
I see.
- What do you see?

259
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,970
Look at this nick. Container damage,
can't sell it anyway.

260
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,810
The neck's chipped...

261
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,440
Here, take it.

262
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,890
That shit does nothing for me.
- It's good vodka, premium stuff.

263
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,410
We've got no money.
- It's a gift.

264
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:18,240
I really need your help.

265
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,170
Things are hard right now.

266
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,400
What am I, stupid?

267
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,720
I need nineteen thousand,
that's nothing for Moscow.

268
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:39,520
Go to the darkies working in the city.
They've got cash, not me.

269
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,930
I don't work stalls.
I'm a salaried employee.

270
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:47,250
So you won't help out?
- I have no money. None!

271
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,650
You want me to give you my word?
- I don't need your word.

272
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:53,250
What do you need?
- You got a problem with me?

273
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:57,000
No, I'm simply telling you to fuck off.
- Wanna hear a joke about friendship?

274
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,210
Two old friends run into each other.
One says, "How've you been?"

275
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,640
"Not bad. You?"
He goes, "I'm gay now".

276
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,160
Heard this one before?
- No.

277
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,160
So the other one asks,
"Do you have a car?"

278
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:10,930
"No". "What about an apartment?"
"No".

279
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:14,050
"What about money in the bank?"
"No money either".

280
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,610
"You know what", the other one says.

281
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:20,930
"As one friend to another, you're
not gay, you're just a cocksucker".

282
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,250
Ignat.

283
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,810
Is that your wife?

284
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,010
One husband sent his wife a telegram
that just said "Tenroubleme".

285
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,330
Need money?

286
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,480
I'm Issa. What's your name?

287
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:35,210
Which bus are you waiting for?
What are you, mute?

288
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,160
Don't know where you're going?

289
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,050
Out-of-towner?

290
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,170
Need money?

291
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:44,090
I can show you where you
can get hold of some money.

292
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,530
Eat up, friend.
The food is good here.

293
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,570
What are you, squeamish?

294
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,650
Should I be?

295
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:02,370
I'm sorry, friend,
I can see you're angry at me.

296
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,930
You don't know what I'm talking
about. Let me explain.

297
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,250
Can't get my head on straight.

298
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:11,050
This one whore has fried my brain.

299
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,570
Can't get my shit together.
I live like a zombie.

300
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:24,490
Drink, friend, eat.

301
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:28,170
I bought her an apartment,
but that wasn't enough for her.

302
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,050
Wants her own business.

303
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,760
I work as a foreman here.

304
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:37,240
The money isn't bad, of course,
but nowhere near enough.

305
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:43,130
My wife is sick
and I gotta help out my two brothers.

306
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,000
She doesn't give a shit.

307
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:50,490
Listen, if you're not going to drink
then at least have some food.

308
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,360
Good-looking bitch.

309
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:57,370
Looks as good coming
as she does going.

310
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:02,130
But I can't afford her.
Can't leave her.

311
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:06,290
But where am I supposed to get
the money? Help me out, Captain.

312
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,650
What are you waiting for?

313
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,040
It's the cops.
- Let them in.

314
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,280
They're cops.
- I heard you. Let them in.

315
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,400
The cops?
- Let them in.

316
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:31,600
Are you Issa?
- Come to have a plate of fish soup?

317
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,200
You can joke around later, smart ass.

318
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:38,730
How many heads in here... seventy?

319
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,410
Exactly, buddy. Fifty-seven.

320
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:44,720
Registration, employment quota,
everything is in order.

321
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,560
The going rate is one grand per Tajik.
- Can't you give me a discount?

322
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:52,170
What are you grinning at?
- Why so rude, buddy?

323
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,650
If you don't pay up,
you're coming with us.

324
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,850
Eat up, friend.
The food is good here.

325
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,210
This is not my day.

326
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:27,930
What's your name?
- Tamara.

327
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,410
From Chechnya?

328
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,930
Russian.

329
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,570
What does your husband call you?
- Tamara.

330
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,800
What about, like, a pet name?
- Tamara.

331
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,730
Show me your passport.

332
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,850
Why so quiet, Tamara?

333
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,770
What about you?
- What about me?

334
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:55,400
You had the soup, right?
Now go help out the cook.

335
00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:00,520
Help out how?
- Start screaming: "Suck my cock, pigs".

336
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:03,650
The cops won't touch a kid,
and they'll let the woman go.

337
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:07,720
What's the matter?
Got no balls?

338
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,920
Go get in the car.
- Why?

339
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,730
Get in the car.

340
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,690
Please don't.
- Don't what?

341
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:20,130
Please.
- Please what?

342
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,320
I'm begging you.

343
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,530
We'll just talk.

344
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:45,000
I wanted another helping.

345
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,610
Having fun?

346
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,890
I'm sorry.

347
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,090
Sorry about what?

348
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,170
I apologize.

349
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,400
Apologize for what?

350
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,010
Sorry.

351
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,170
What's with this "sorry, sorry..." crap?

352
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:16,490
I'm sorry. For everything.
- What are you, stupid?

353
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,400
Get lost.

354
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,210
Who are you?

355
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,290
The cook.

356
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,330
Where's the plate?

357
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,810
Here, have some.

358
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,880
Doesn't it hurt?
- What?

359
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:43,930
Your hand.
- No, it doesn't hurt here.

360
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:50,490
Don't do this, bro.
Come on man, don't be suicidal.

361
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,880
You're not my bro, pig.

362
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,410
What did you say?

363
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,880
I'm not paying.

364
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:05,210
Watch it, Issa. If we find Chechens
here, prices will double.

365
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:09,290
You shouldn't have come, Sergeant.
There won't be any money.

366
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,640
Help me out, Captain.

367
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,690
Cut the bitch's face up.

368
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:32,600
I don't care if her face is fucked up,
as long as she's put in her place.

369
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:37,450
Are we paid up for the soup?
- Hey, what are you talking about.

370
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,400
Relax, we're all good.

371
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:50,050
You're a stranger in Moscow.

372
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,370
In and out,
do your thing and disappear.

373
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,640
Help some people, make some money.

374
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,690
How much money do you want, Captain?
Don't be shy.

375
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,970
Deal? Eh, friend?

376
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,330
You shouldn't have got involved,
Comrade Captain.

377
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:23,890
The cops looked mean.
Bloodshot eyes, like bulls.

378
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,850
My mother always says,
"Smile when they're messing with you".

379
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,600
Comrade Captain, you shouldn't
have got into it.

380
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,450
Could've turned ugly.

381
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,850
Did you like the soup?

382
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,650
Did you like the soup?
- Smells like piss.

383
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,680
You're right, Captain,
people around here are mean.

384
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,040
They insult us,
throw a punch for no reason.

385
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,600
It's hard, being on your own here.

386
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:17,090
We should be throwing punches, not them.
Stick together, to take what's ours.

387
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:21,930
What's yours around here?
- I'll show you, OK?

388
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,330
Have we left Moscow yet?

389
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,570
Almost.

390
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,730
Do you have a woman?
- No.

391
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,570
Never had one?
- I did.

392
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:25,680
And now?
- No.

393
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,730
If you want I can be your woman.

394
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,250
OK.

395
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,920
You don't care?
- Well, no.

396
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:04,410
You're lying.
I can see that you care.

397
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,250
No, I'm not lying.

398
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,770
Bitch.

399
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,290
He'll be back with his brothers.

400
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,130
Your husband?
- My landlord.

401
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:00,850
Nice place.
- I earned it.

402
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,050
You are a bitch.

403
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:11,330
I earned this place.
You do the math.

404
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,090
One hour with a prostitute
costs two hundred bucks.

405
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,890
Issa comes over for two hours
every other day.

406
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,810
Do the math.
That adds up to seventy thousand a year.

407
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:24,920
In three years, I've more than
paid this place off.

408
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,410
Help me, please?

409
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:32,520
Tell Issa you're my husband.

410
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:35,330
Issa's not Russian. He can get nasty.
He'll jump on you.

411
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,170
They'll lock him up.

412
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,370
Then we'll trade him the criminal
case for the apartment.

413
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,290
Nineteen thousand.

414
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,130
Dollars?

415
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,410
Nineteen thousand roubles.

416
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,730
For nineteen grand,
you also have to punch his face in.

417
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,210
Are you going to fight him?

418
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,040
Comrade Captain, I can talk to him.

419
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,170
I swear, we'll make friends with him.

420
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:18,850
Wanna hear a joke about a fight?

421
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,400
Tell your jokes to fools.
Leave me alone.

422
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,880
You're about to get caught up
in something horrible.

423
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,200
You killed your daughter -
enough already!

424
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,970
Having a laugh?

425
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:48,690
No, Comrade Captain.
Trying to get you to have a laugh.

426
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,290
It's not working.

427
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,930
I know. I'm not funny.

428
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,480
Being funny - that's victory.

429
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:07,770
You make someone laugh,
and he's yours forever.

430
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:10,160
He'll do whatever you want.

431
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,330
No need to raise your fists.

432
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:18,600
You feel sorry for yourself,
but you're scared of admitting it.

433
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:21,890
It's always like that with guilt.

434
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:25,680
That's why you terrorize everyone.
Get angry, dish out abuse.

435
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:28,930
A real bull.

436
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:34,210
Why didn't you make a run for it
at the train station?

437
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,850
I felt sorry for you.

438
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,000
Admit it: You didn't have the balls.

439
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:45,730
You're a real bull, Comrade Captain.
I always feel sorry for people like that.

440
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,090
Listen here.

441
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:54,640
It wasn't my fault, you hear me?

442
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:57,530
Tanya was little.
She got a stomach ache.

443
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:00,490
My wife was away on business,
and I was late for my watch.

444
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:06,370
I asked her, "Want to go to the hospital?"
She didn't answer. No reaction.

445
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,850
I thought, must be food poisoning.
Gave her some emetic to make her vomit.

446
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,320
Still nothing. No reaction.

447
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:15,690
I said, " Speak up. I have to go
to the unit. I'm on watch.

448
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:18,490
If it's food poisoning, go puke,
or go sit on the toilet".

449
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:21,210
Again, no reaction.
She just stared at me silently.

450
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,890
So I lost it. Yes, I did.

451
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,920
Hit her with my hand, just a little.

452
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,210
Again, no reaction -
just stared at me silently.

453
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,600
So I spat and left.

454
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,880
Told her, " You can die,
for all I care".

455
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:51,690
Tanya...

456
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:08,490
What's the matter with you?
- Your turn: Caw!

457
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:11,690
You're a cock.
- I'm not a cock, Comrade Captain.

458
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:13,290
I'm a raven.

459
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:19,170
Cocks go looking for a fight.
Ravens are the opposite.

460
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:21,890
People eat cocks.
Ravens eat people.

461
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:25,010
Ravens live forever.
Cocks die.

462
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:27,280
Ravens protect people.

463
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:31,370
When he finds a suffering man,
he takes the suffering from him.

464
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:38,170
Do the pills help?
- Yes.

465
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,895
It wasn't my fault.
What am I, a doctor

466
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:49,080
to know the difference between
diarrhea and acute appendicitis?

467
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:57,370
Throw this away,
and you'll forget everything.

468
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:01,650
Throw the rock, Comrade Captain
and your pain will go away.

469
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:21,080
I was just messing around,
Comrade Captain.

470
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:28,000
Wanted to get back at you, like guys
do, when they're pushed too far.

471
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:32,890
Didn't work out for me,
I just punished myself.

472
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:38,930
The cops tricked me,
Comrade Captain.

473
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:43,050
Took the money.
Tore my fatigues.

474
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,770
Well, I got a hooker
at the intersection.

475
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:54,280
Paid off the pimp, hailed a car.

476
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:59,080
The cops stopped the car and were like,
"The broad doesn't have papers, pay up".

477
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,560
Like I don't know they get
kickbacks from every whore.

478
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:05,450
So I told the pigs to go suck it.

479
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:08,530
They started beating me up,
arrested me.

480
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:13,520
I had to give them all the money,
or I'd get done for disorderly conduct.

481
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:18,840
What are you staring at,
Comrade Captain?

482
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:22,520
Want to punish me? Go ahead,
I'm right here.

483
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:28,170
How much did the cops take?
- All of it. Nineteen thousand.

484
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:30,210
They're getting kickbacks
from the intersection.

485
00:46:55,970 --> 00:47:00,050
A sergeant was in here earlier,
you made him pay nineteen thousand.

486
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:02,040
That money belongs to me,
give it back.

487
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:06,370
Where's my money? Hey!
- I know nothing about it. New shift.

488
00:47:06,405 --> 00:47:08,760
Give me your commanding officer's
phone number.

489
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:11,050
No way, bro.
- I'm not your bro, pig.

490
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:15,560
I swear, our boys didn't take any money.
- Swear man to man?

491
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:17,450
Sure, whatever you want.

492
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,410
You don't understand.

493
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:23,330
Let's see your ID, Captain.

494
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:25,050
No, you don't get it.

495
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,320
I said, let's see your papers.

496
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:33,680
Stand up.

497
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,610
Here! Give me back my money.

498
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,850
How can you know which are yours?

499
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:49,120
Mine is signed.

500
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:06,250
Enough, don't kill him.

501
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:09,770
Should I get a cell ready?

502
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:12,080
So, are we bros now?

503
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,450
Give me back my money.

504
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:19,130
Should we lock him up?
- Nah, call the army patrol.

505
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:22,290
Comrade Captain?
- Let his people deal with him.

506
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:30,520
They're on-duty police officers,
and you, Comrade Captain,

507
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:34,130
start throwing chairs around.
Demanding money.

508
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:37,330
This is extortion, plain and simple.
This isn't self-defense.

509
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:39,640
I'm not apologizing.

510
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:43,770
You have the AWOL?

511
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:51,050
It says here: " Two soldiers
accompanied by an officer".

512
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:53,450
These are my detached duty documents.

513
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:58,610
I know all about these trips.
Been on them myself.

514
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:05,770
Too late to get the AWOL
back quietly, bro.

515
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:09,410
You have tickets for
Timofeyev and Tugayev.

516
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:12,010
Timofeyev is listed in
a murder case.

517
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:15,440
Tugayev is wanted
as a deserter and an accessory.

518
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:17,570
You know where he is?

519
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:25,890
Tugayev is wanted throughout the district.
Murder of a police officer.

520
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:27,840
You realize who you're transporting?

521
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:31,720
If it were up to me
I'd bulldoze this entire place.

522
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:34,570
I'd get the equipment and raze
the entire place to the ground.

523
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:36,760
Bury everyone under the asphalt.

524
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:47,130
Go back to your detached duty, Comrade
Captain, but give it some thought.

525
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:54,130
If you don't take care of this,
I swear on my insignia, you'll be sorry.

526
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:59,890
The cops fucked you over,
Comrade Captain, didn't they?

527
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:04,080
Timofeyev should've been raising hell
here instead of the barracks.

528
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:06,410
Wanna hear a joke about barracks?

529
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,970
Do you visit the grave?
- No.

530
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:42,480
Everything's fine with you then?

531
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:45,360
I'm not apologizing.

532
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,490
Take as much as you need.
- It's OK.

533
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:54,090
You need it.

534
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:07,250
You should move here.

535
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:11,210
I can't handle Moscow.

536
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,240
My husband will help you out.

537
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:17,930
If I can find work, I'll risk it.

538
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:22,560
No, you won't come.

539
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:26,930
Ignat.

540
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:32,850
It wasn't your fault.
- I know.

541
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:36,640
It wasn't your fault.

542
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:42,130
It wasn't your fault, Ignat.

543
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:51,640
It wasn't your fault.

544
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:55,690
I see her,
when the pain gets too much.

545
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:01,280
I know I'm hallucinating.
I see Tanya, alive and well.

546
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:04,000
I don't take the pills.

547
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,010
I don't resign.

548
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:11,210
I'm scared to change things.

549
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:14,720
Scared to change anything, you know?

550
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:20,080
You should move here.

551
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,560
You should.

552
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,770
Forget the money.

553
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:33,240
Tanya is dead.

554
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:35,090
You have to go on living.

555
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:38,090
You don't understand.

556
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:57,530
You should've taken the money,
it was a heartfelt offer.

557
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:59,760
You wanted to run? Go ahead.

558
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:01,810
What are you doing, Comrade Captain?

559
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:06,650
They'll fuck us for this.
- I'm not apologizing.

560
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:12,050
I told you he'd let me go.
I know a secret.

561
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,920
Thank you, Comrade Captain.

562
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:19,840
You shouldn't have. He's a piece of shit.
- And you're any better?

563
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:22,930
You wanted to see the city?
Go ahead. Forward march.

564
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:55,330
Want some, Comrade Captain?
- Where did you get it?

565
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:57,130
I got it to warm up the whore.

566
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:00,840
A hundred and seventy roubles.
Three stars.

567
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:05,210
Probably counterfeit
- It's not counterfeit. What do you mean?

568
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,480
Definitely counterfeit.

569
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:10,920
Why would you say that, Comrade Captain?

570
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,250
Say what?

571
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:23,970
Where did you put the bottle?

572
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,730
The Captain changed his mind?

573
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:47,250
No, it's just me.

574
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:51,920
You like money?
- Nah, I want to help the captain.

575
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:56,130
Get out.

576
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:06,330
Nineteen thousand, as promised?

577
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:10,930
I'm not gonna sleep with you.
- You don't have to.

578
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:15,410
I'm not gonna sleep with you.
- You don't have to.

579
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,410
I like you.

580
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:25,760
No, go away.

581
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:29,760
I swear, we'll become friends.
I know a secret.

582
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:37,090
I'll deal with Issa, I'm telling you.
- Enough, clown, forget it.

583
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:58,040
It stinks here, Comrade Captain,
like our unit depot.

584
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:03,200
Here, friend, buy some fresh pork.
Your stomach will thank you.

585
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:07,930
How much for a kilo?
- Three-fifty per kilo. Good price.

586
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:11,250
This place is nuts, Comrade Captain.

587
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:15,770
Bet it tastes like asbestos.

588
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:20,450
It's a boar. Good meat.

589
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:25,160
How are sales?

590
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:29,520
Today's been slow. Too cold.

591
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:32,210
Have you made nineteen thousand?

592
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:34,490
Got money?

593
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:39,530
Just take the meat; consider it a gift.
You don't have to pay.

594
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,370
What, got too much cash?

595
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,570
Say something.
- What should I say?

596
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:46,610
Say, "Caw".

597
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:48,290
Say, "Caw, caw".

598
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:52,080
Say, "Caw, caw".
To ward off evil. I'm the evil.

599
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:54,200
Say, "Caw, caw".

600
00:56:54,850 --> 00:57:00,210
I have the money, Captain.

601
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:02,400
Listen, that's not enough.

602
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:05,130
Right, take it.

603
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,890
Shut up, bitch.

604
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,970
I said, shut up!

605
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:43,250
Who are you?
- The husband.

606
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:44,770
Whose husband?

607
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:55,250
Bring some soup; your husband is home.

608
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:57,970
You know
who you're dealing with, bitch?

609
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:04,570
Issa, I paid off that apartment.
I'm going to live by myself now.

610
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:11,450
You're a whore.

611
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:18,770
Wanna hear a joke about a prostitute?

612
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:23,490
Two friends run into each other.
The first one says, "How've you been?"

613
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:26,930
"Not bad. What about you?"
She goes, "I became a prostitute".

614
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,880
Heard this one before?
- No.

615
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:31,040
The other one says,
"Do you have a car?"

616
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:34,010
"No." "What about an apartment?" "No".

617
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:36,450
"What about money in the bank?"
"No money either".

618
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:39,770
"You know what", says her friend,
"Let me tell you a secret.

619
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,000
You're no prostitute.
You're a whore".

620
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:45,530
Bitch.

621
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:03,730
Now you.

622
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:08,650
Tear him a new one.

623
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:11,760
Take his papers.

624
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:15,170
He's a nobody. Go right ahead.

625
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:45,120
You fucked him?
- What am I, an idiot?

626
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:47,530
No, you're a whore.

627
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:50,250
He was joking.

628
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:55,810
Cut that bitch a smile?
- No, you do it.

629
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:59,130
Got no balls?
- She's your whore. You cut her.

630
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:02,600
Please, baby, don't.

631
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:07,330
Move your hands, bitch.

632
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:13,450
Please, baby, have mercy.

633
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:20,970
You're dead, bitch. Dead.

634
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:23,290
Please, Issa.

635
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:26,610
She's nothing but an animal.
You go right ahead.

636
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:28,600
You think I'm disgusting, don't you?

637
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:31,880
Cut her a smile.

638
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:41,770
Is this funny?

639
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:44,690
Go ahead, laugh.

640
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:54,930
Thank you, baby, thank you, Issa.

641
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:04,810
What's with you, clown?

642
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:09,090
You're a cock.

643
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:14,810
You look like one. Rooster, right?

644
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,040
Caw.

645
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:18,930
He's a cocksucker, bro.

646
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:22,920
Cottonball is on duty tonight.
Let's call Cottonball.

647
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,610
Want to organize a little
gangbang for the kid?

648
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:11,770
That's what Issa wants.

649
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:16,480
Are you going to fuck him yourself?

650
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:19,530
I didn't sign up for this shit.

651
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:24,010
You people from the Caucuses...

652
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:29,040
To hear you talk, you're so cool.
But it's all talk.

653
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:31,610
What's your problem, Cottonball?

654
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:33,530
You know why they call me Cottonball?

655
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:42,690
Because I'm soft.

656
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:08,570
Want some, buddy?
- That shit does nothing for me.

657
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:12,730
Don't worry, kid, I'll sneak you out
through the basement.

658
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:16,080
What business brought you here?

659
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:18,610
Don't worry about it.

660
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:23,600
Why are you here?
- Unauthorized absence from the unit.

661
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:25,890
Fuck those bitches.

662
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:29,890
Nah, I enlisted myself.
- Why would you do that?

663
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:34,170
Don't worry about it.
- No, why did you enlist?

664
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:40,850
My father told me, when he was
demobilized he thanked the army.

665
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:43,770
I wanted to thank it too.

666
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:45,690
And did you?

667
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:54,410
Private Timofeyev, we're from
the same town. They started...

668
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:58,680
messing with him at the barracks.
They were just testing him.

669
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:03,530
But Timofeyev figured it was a matter
of principle. Fought back.

670
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:09,920
Timofeyev was a vicious one
- a real bull.

671
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:14,850
He used to say, when he was mad,
he couldn't see anything.

672
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:17,610
Nothing but red flies.

673
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:22,010
I always feel bad for a kid
when they break him.

674
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:26,330
The sergeants humiliated Timofeyev,
so he went AWOL.

675
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:28,970
I jumped the fence with him.

676
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:32,930
Figured, since we were friends,
I'd convince him to come back.

677
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:36,690
Worst case, they'd beat us up,
but probably even let us off

678
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:38,610
so they could meet their
statistical targets.

679
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:44,050
Timofeyev wouldn't listen to me.
Now he's dead.

680
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,330
Now I have to pay for the both of us.

681
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:49,160
They tell me I could get six years.

682
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:53,210
Fuck those bitches.

683
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:58,850
Nah, man, army life is great
I swear, want me to cross myself?

684
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:05,160
You know how to suck cock?

685
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:40,760
You know what this means?

686
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,290
It's a violin.

687
01:05:43,490 --> 01:05:48,970
No, not a violin. A fiddle.

688
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:54,370
You know?
- So it's a violin. So what?

689
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:58,410
In prison, it means you know
how to suck cock.

690
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:10,650
Want me to bring my wife later?

691
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:13,970
She's always understanding.
Always up for anything.

692
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:22,450
May I sit next to you?

693
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:27,530
You don't have to.
- Please?

694
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:04,120
You won't be sorry, I promise.

695
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:46,050
I told you, you don't have the balls
to make a run for it.

696
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:49,010
You'll lose your nerve.
- Didn't want the ticket to go to waste.

697
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:51,730
The ticket is bought and paid for.
I have to go.

698
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:53,730
Good math, kid:

699
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:56,130
Second desertion
more than doubles your sentence.

700
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:04,570
It's all shit, eh?

701
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:10,240
Is it time, Comrade Captain?
Is our train departing?

702
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:13,090
We have to go, Comrade Captain.
It's all shit.

703
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:27,530
Just take it, Comrade Captain.

704
01:08:27,610 --> 01:08:30,290
It's a gift.
From the bottom of the heart.

705
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:32,760
It's not counterfeit. Real liquor.

706
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:36,560
Honest-to-goodness vodka.
That's right.

707
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:40,090
Want some?
- Yes.

708
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:44,490
I'll come back here on my holidays,
they'll be sorry they were ever born.

709
01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:54,330
This shit does nothing for me.

710
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:59,130
He was begging, saying,
"Please, I really need it".

711
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:03,210
Offered me his wife as reward.
Says, "You won't be sorry, no way".

712
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:06,650
So, OK, what do I care?

713
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:08,170
OK what?

714
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:16,320
OK what?
- Who? Issa?

715
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:23,770
I thought I'd make some money,
nineteen thousand.

716
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:29,290
I know I'm not funny,
Comrade Captain. You're right.

717
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:32,240
It's all shit, Comrade Captain.

718
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:37,290
I don't want any.

719
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:39,840
What's with you?
- I don't want any more.

720
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:42,970
I said, drink.
- What's the matter, Comrade Captain?

721
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:45,570
What?
- I don't want any more, period.

722
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:50,400
Where did you get the vodka?
- From some Siberians at the train station.

723
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:54,170
Don't expect a reward for going AWOL.
I'll personally report you as a deserter.

724
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:57,720
You're under contract.
Don't expect leniency.

725
01:09:57,810 --> 01:10:01,040
It'll be a criminal case.
- I'm sorry, Comrade Captain.

726
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:03,170
You don't understand.

727
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:08,570
I only spent some of it. Thought
I'd keep the rest for vacation.

728
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:16,530
Promise me, Comrade Captain,
that you won't report me.

729
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:25,280
It's nobody's money.
That's why I took it.

730
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:30,040
If you found it on the ground,
you'd take it too.

731
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:32,080
Why raise a stink?

732
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:37,610
If you hadn't seen the vodka,
you'd never have guessed.

733
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:41,770
I chose to confess, and handed
over the money voluntarily.

734
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:45,370
Full confession, Comrade Captain.
Let's just call it that.

735
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:48,210
Drink, bitch.

736
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:52,210
I'll finish it.

737
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:13,050
Nineteen thousand,
minus liquor and cigarettes.

738
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:16,210
Where's the rest?
Are you holding out?

739
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:19,090
I can put some money in
if necessary.

740
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:23,600
Write up the nineteen thousand
at the accounting office.

741
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:26,200
How much did they take?
- You can take the money.

742
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:29,640
We already wrote it off. That's not
the issue: First, AWOL, theft,

743
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:32,330
a dead police officer; suicide...

744
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:37,450
What did you do to make that soldier jump?
- How much money do I have to add?

745
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:42,290
Write up Private Tugayev, Comrade Captain.
Officially, at the garrison.

746
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:45,850
We'll start an investigation,
file a case. He's going to jail.

747
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:48,690
Everyone is sick of disorderly conduct.

748
01:11:58,050 --> 01:11:59,730
What do you want?

749
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:02,760
I request that you let the AWOL go.

750
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:06,640
The kid won't survive military jail.
- Why not?

751
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:09,690
Shrieks like a bird.

752
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:12,970
Too late.

753
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:19,640
Wanna hear a joke
about a cat and mouse?

754
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:21,170
OK.

755
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:25,890
A cat goes hunting in the basement.
Walks in, sees a pair of huge eyes.

756
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:29,210
He gets scared and goes, "Who are you?"
"A mouse".

757
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:32,450
"Why do you have such huge eyes?"
- "I'm shitting".

758
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:34,250
What do you want?

759
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:40,210
Not funny, huh?
- Nah, it's OK.

760
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:51,130
Let the AWOL go, bro.
He'll die in jail.

761
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:55,090
I can't.
- Why not?

762
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:58,760
Too late, bro. Can't do it.

763
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:00,650
Why not?

764
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:04,850
Everyone is sick of disorderly conduct.

765
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:22,770
It's time, Comrade Captain.
We're on a schedule.

766
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:24,610
Five minutes.

767
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:38,410
Where does it hurt?

768
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:43,680
It hurts here.
- No, it doesn't hurt there.

769
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:51,050
Don't let them take me right away,
Comrade Captain.

770
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:55,120
Let me stay here a while.

771
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:06,200
You know where it hurts, kid?

772
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:09,530
Where?
- Nowhere.

773
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:15,370
Soon, Comrade Captain?

774
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:19,280
Don't let them take me right away,
Comrade Captain.

775
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:22,690
I don't need this.
What's so special about him?

776
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:26,570
What have I done, Comrade Captain?

777
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:32,730
What have I done, Comrade Captain?

778
01:14:33,450 --> 01:14:36,490
Stand up! Atten-hut!

779
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:39,490
Forward march!

780
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,290
I feel bad for the kid.

781
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:33,010
Though he was a complete idiot.
I could tell right away.

782
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,610
What now, Comrade Captain?
Back to the unit, eh?

783
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:41,170
Give the government's money back,
sign for it, right?

784
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:45,210
What time is lunch, Comrade Captain?
Is it time yet?

785
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:50,080
Please forgive me, Comrade Captain.
Please don't.

786
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:53,370
You want to punish me? Go ahead,
just don't put me in jail.

787
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:58,970
Comrade Captain, please forgive me.

788
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:03,250
Comrade Captain, please don't.

789
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:06,690
Please forgive me, Comrade Captain.

790
01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:11,170
Comrade Captain...

791
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:28,410
Thank you.

792
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:33,330
Thank you, Comrade Captain.

793
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:37,360
Just don't put me in jail.

794
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:45,610
Promise me, Comrade Captain.

795
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:51,960
I have your word, yeah?
