00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,125
I'm Willie Dixon.

3
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,627
And I'm making this here audio recording

4
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,256
so that when you visit
Chess Recording Studio,

5
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,334
you know the history.

6
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:20,007
Now, the first time a gal took off her
underwear and threw them on stage

7
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:23,202
it was on account of
a fella singing the blues.

8
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:28,008
Now, when the white girls started doing it,
they called that rock and roll.

9
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:32,278
Took a whole lot of people to make
the music that changed the world.

10
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,946
Yes, sir. This story ain't just about me.

11
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,256
<i>It all started with two men.</i>

12
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,533
<i>One a white boy from Chicago.</i>

13
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,330
Len, when are we getting married?

14
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:52,768
<i>A witness for my Lord</i>

15
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,137
<i>The other a sharecropper
from Mississippi.</i>

16
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,836
<i>Say, who was a witness?</i>

17
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,436
<i>The year was 1941.</i>

18
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,143
<i>Say, Daniel was a witness</i>

19
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,148
When are we getting married?

20
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,353
I don't have the money.

21
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:14,085
I told you I'd be fine without it.

22
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,057
Well, I wouldn't.

23
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,566
You don't know what it did to my father.

24
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,800
I can't watch you go hungry.

25
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,245
Da.

26
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,522
Oh, how you doing, Mr. Feder?

27
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,155
Hi, Dad.

28
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,367
I want to marry her.

29
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,401
Mr. Feder, I don't know if I told you,

30
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:05,341
but I've been making plans to get out of
the junk business.

31
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,039
I'm gonna open a club here.

32
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,976
In the Negro neighborhood?

33
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,110
Yeah. It's gonna be for Negroes.

34
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,780
You're taking Shelly to Negro clubs?

35
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,586
No, of course not.

36
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,755
No, I'm just...

37
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,263
I'd like you to know that
I'm making plans for the future.

38
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,857
So, you are serious
about this marriage then?

39
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,265
Yeah.

40
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,398
I mean, when I can afford it.

41
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:36,373
Your father and I, we come from
the same shithole in Poland.

42
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,744
I didn't travel all this way

43
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,873
to have my daughter marry some schmuck
from the same village.

44
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,583
What did you say?

45
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,344
- What did you say?
- Get in.

46
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,752
Leonard.

47
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,957
Don't worry where I'm from.

48
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,723
My wife's gonna drive a Cadillac.

49
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,604
Now, who is this here?

50
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,545
Go on, get in the house now.

51
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,344
McKinley Morganfield?

52
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,412
Yes, sir?

53
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,241
I'm Alan Lomax,

54
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,615
and this is Mr. John Work
from Fisk University.

55
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,084
- How you doing?
- Fine. You?

56
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,748
I'm recording folk music
for the Library of Congress.

57
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,949
Folk music?

58
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,821
Could you move into the mike
a little bit for me? Thanks.

59
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,795
Play that thing, man.

60
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,225
That's what I sound like, huh?

61
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,956
Yes, sir, that's what you sound like.

62
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:50,337
Feel like I'm meeting myself
for the first time.

63
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:57,310
<i>And he was. And he knew
it was a man he was meeting,</i>

64
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,086
<i>too big for that slave
shack he was born in</i>

65
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,548
<i>and too big for that plantation.</i>

66
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:23,235
<i>Now, the acoustic guitar</i>
<i>was fine down south,</i>

67
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:27,540
<i>because there's nothing but miles of</i>
<i>empty fields out your window.</i>

68
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:33,482
<i>But in the city, with all
them streetcars and automobiles,</i>

69
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,585
<i>you couldn't get yourself heard.</i>

70
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,049
Hey, boy, ain't nobody want to hear
that sharecropping music.

71
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:46,254
Take that shit back down there
to Mississippi.

72
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:51,863
Hey.

73
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,166
You're disturbing the peace!

74
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,879
Why you want to cut me for, girl?

75
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,385
You have been giving that same smile
to girls all morning.

76
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,353
You must have three addresses
in your pocket.

77
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:11,980
Addresses?

78
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,622
No.

79
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,955
- You're trouble. You know that?
- I know.

80
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,658
How about you?

81
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,747
You got to go, before my mama brings
the boys home. Come on.

82
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,753
- Maybe those boys need a daddy.
- You're not daddy material.

83
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,454
I'm not good enough for you?

84
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,557
I don't talk as good as you
or something, huh?

85
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,393
When I heard you start playing that music

86
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,265
it took me someplace so good, Muddy.

87
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,173
So good.

88
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,542
Here you go, baby.

89
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,817
Are you the owner of this club?

90
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,352
Yes, I am.

91
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,416
Isabella Allen. I make race records.

92
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,353
Len Chess. How you doing? Wow.

93
00:09:56,462 --> 00:10:01,456
This is a beauty.
God, look at the lines on this thing.

94
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,562
It's incredible.

95
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,001
You can buy a car like this
making race records?

96
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,301
If you find the right singer.

97
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,844
Hey, I'd love to know
if you hear someone special.

98
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,508
A record producer, huh?

99
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,175
There'd be something in it for you.

100
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,111
All right.

101
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,779
Sweet. That's a beautiful car.

102
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,347
You looking for girls?

103
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,884
Excuse me? No, I'm opening a club.

104
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,486
I don't mind you getting
men all liquored up

105
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,327
but I lost two daughters to bluesmen.

106
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,458
Dangerous business you in.

107
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,584
What are you doing?

108
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:59,018
<i>When Muddy met Little Walter,</i>
<i>he was just 17 years old,</i>

109
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,424
<i>but he was the greatest harp
player that ever lived.</i>

110
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,894
<i>That's it. That's all of it.</i>

111
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,565
- Yeah, man.
- Play that for me.

112
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,103
I'll give you $1
if you let me strum that guitar.

113
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,613
I can busk more than your dollar.

114
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,184
- I'll give you $2.
- You a headhunter?

115
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,482
You fixing to chop my head off
with my own guitar? Man.

116
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,022
Shit, you can't play better than me.

117
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,285
Let me see the guitar, man.

118
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:18,259
Hey, big guy,
your daddy sure can cook, huh?

119
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,598
You're not gonna take care of Walter?

120
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,231
Oh, I don't drink none of that.

121
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,708
Good for you, Walter.
I'll make you a nice bath.

122
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,745
Okay, thank you, ma'am.

123
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,542
Why you got a gun?

124
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,510
- In case in any good guys need shooting.
- You mean the bad guys?

125
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,222
I is the bad guy.

126
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,586
Hush now, scaring my boys,
and let me hear some of that harp.

127
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,060
Okay, okay.

128
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,068
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

129
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,609
- Where in the hell you going?
- Follow me now. Come on.

130
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:02,272
No, no, no. No, look here.
You follow this guitar, son.

131
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,678
"Son"?

132
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,716
You can play the shit out of that guitar,
so I'll follow you anywhere you want,

133
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:14,124
but don't you ever be
calling me no "son."

134
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,488
Okay?

135
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,889
- I don't need no daddy.
- No, boy, what you need is a mama.

136
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,264
Someone who will feed you and clothe you

137
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,837
and tell you to get
your behind in that bath.

138
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,429
Well, you know what they say, now.

139
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,466
A man can't have too many mamas.

140
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,410
And you don't need this. You need soap.

141
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,649
He fit me, Geneva.

142
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,716
I heard.

143
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,525
He fit me.

144
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,892
<i>They was a family now.</i>

145
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,366
<i>Little Walter, Muddy Waters</i>
<i>and Jimmy Rogers</i>

146
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,400
<i>called themselves
"The All-Star Trio,"</i>

147
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,836
<i>but everybody else knew</i>
<i>them as "The Headhunters"</i>

148
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,668
<i>on account of how</i>
<i>they sliced their competition.</i>

149
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,270
Will you help me out here?

150
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,916
- Get your own gig, motherfucker!
- Let them play!

151
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,477
- Get out of the way, Mud.
- Fucking son of a bitch!

152
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,641
This is between me and this motherfucker.
Get out the way, Mud.

153
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,844
- Son...
- I told you never to be calling me that.

154
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:51,081
I know you did. But we family now.

155
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,953
Then what the fuck you doing, Mud?

156
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,787
Give me that pistol.

157
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,762
I ain't trying to boss you.
But you're just too good to lose.

158
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:03,533
We'll burn Chicago down if you don't
get your ass locked up or killed.

159
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,434
- You think I never used this before?
- I know you did.

160
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,972
Then you know I'll shoot
this whole motherfucker up then.

161
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,475
But you ain't got to use it tonight.
If he foolish enough to come after you

162
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,376
I'll put the bullet in him my damn self.

163
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,352
You a crazy motherfucker, Mud.

164
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,220
Run, motherfucker! Run!

165
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,294
You can get out of here, too.

166
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,192
I'll talk this peckerwood
into not calling the police.

167
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,423
Oh, okay.

168
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,529
Sorry about that, chief.

169
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,634
Sorry about the damage, boss.

170
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,174
Yeah, you fucked up my place. You...

171
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,506
Yes, sir. It's a damn shame, boss.

172
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,512
Just get out.

173
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,051
Here. There you go.

174
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,348
Appreciate it.

175
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,919
Fucked up my shit.

176
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,755
Ain't never see them pitchers?
Here's how you do it.

177
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,491
When you get that ball,
you gonna kick that leg over.

178
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,796
You gonna throw that thing
way up there like that.

179
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,235
Been looking all over for you.

180
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,405
We're just here working, sir.

181
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,100
I thought we was all right, boss.

182
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,509
Stop talking to me
like I'm some damn plantation owner.

183
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,843
What the fuck you want then?

184
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,382
I want to put you on a record.

185
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,420
- A record?
- Yeah, that's right.

186
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:30,920
You're kidding.

187
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,547
No, sir, boss.

188
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,120
Let me get this straight now.

189
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:43,167
We shoot up half your whole joint,
and now you want to put us on a record.

190
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,168
Yeah, that's right.

191
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,636
I hear good things about you.

192
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,800
- When do you want to do this?
- Right now. The studio's booked.

193
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,605
- But I got to get my band.
- No, you don't.

194
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,738
Not the crazy harp-playing motherfucker,
you don't. No. Just you.

195
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,680
You want to do this?

196
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,252
- Yeah.
- Come on. Studio's booked.

197
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:05,449
<i>Well, I'm going away to leave</i>
<i>Won't be back no more</i>

198
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,389
<i>Going back down south, child...</i>

199
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:12,386
<i>Now, Leonard Chess didn't</i>
<i>worry none about skin color.</i>

200
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,262
<i>It was the color of them
bills that mattered.</i>

201
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,660
<i>Just get you enough
green to cover yourself</i>

202
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,701
<i>and then you ain't
no Jew-boy no more.</i>

203
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,532
<i>And you ain't no
colored boy either.</i>

204
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,902
<i>You're just a man with a Cadillac.</i>

205
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,172
It's so beautiful!

206
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,712
- Do we have enough?
- Hi, baby. Stop with the "enough."

207
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,219
This is America. The word is "more."

208
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,221
I like the way your husband thinks.

209
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,553
You must be Muddy.

210
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,389
I'm Revetta. I love your record.

211
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,889
Thank you. Pleasure to meet you.

212
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,233
I packed for a week. Will that be enough?

213
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,363
Yeah, that ought to be good.

214
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,840
I think she's asking,
how long are you gonna be gone.

215
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,173
Come here. Hey.

216
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,440
Close your eyes.

217
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,312
A little friend to keep you company
while I'm gone.

218
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,081
There you go.

219
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:16,659
- Can we afford this?
- Don't worry about it. It's classy.

220
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,229
Thank you.

221
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,432
I tell you, that's a whole lot of ocean.

222
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,628
Take a hell of a lot
to get me to cross it.

223
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,998
How come you didn't stay your ass
in Poland?

224
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,908
How come you didn't stay your ass
in Mississippi?

225
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,812
<i>Len knew the only way</i>
<i>to make it big was radio.</i>

226
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,117
<i>And that meant taking</i>
<i>Muddy back down South.</i>

227
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:52,155
- Thank you very much.
- The man don't need no more Scotch.

228
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,137
I got a hell of a mortgage.

229
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,172
Shit.

230
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,335
Yeah, I got one of those.

231
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,845
I tell you what.
Throw this record on the table.

232
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,107
It pays off everybody's.

233
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,375
Leonard...

234
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,782
If people buy Muddy's record,
I got to make more.

235
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,615
Then I'm into you every month.

236
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,884
Yeah, but I got to be fair, you know.

237
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,051
I know you got to be fair.

238
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:27,094
The motherfuckers bring in the
Glenfiddich and the Johnnie Walker.

239
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,862
But you got to ask yourself,

240
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:33,096
do they really stand up
to Jackson and Grant?

241
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,713
I don't bribe deejays.

242
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,785
I do.

243
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,026
You realize he doesn't care
about your music.

244
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,257
It's just about the money with him.

245
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:04,233
<i>Everybody, this is the newest race
music right out of Chicago.</i>

246
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,604
You're on your own.

247
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:22,146
<i>Now, in the South, whites and coloreds</i>
<i>didn't ride around in the same car</i>

248
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,683
<i>unless the colored
man was chauffeuring.</i>

249
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,884
Fuck Mississippi police.

250
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,029
You got to bless them.

251
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,005
- All right, easy. Thank you.
- Hey, you gotta bless them.

252
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,667
- It's very good.
- Room service.

253
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,984
Well, hello.

254
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,850
- We heard you on the radio.
- Come on in.

255
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,188
No, he don't bite. And I don't either.

256
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:07,823
Play it, Daddy.

257
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,625
Yeah.

258
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,694
Don't rush it.

259
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,210
Don't step on it now.
That's Chicago's heartbeat.

260
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,411
Go on, now.

261
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,650
You've got such hair.

262
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,343
Play that for me, Daddy.

263
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,820
I lied to you, girl.

264
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,652
Yeah, I like that.

265
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:42,596
- Where you going? Don't leave us alone.
- I'll swing one over your way.

266
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,362
I'm married.

267
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,767
Yeah, and they ain't redhead.

268
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,699
That's bullshit.

269
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:56,974
Yeah, that's right. Come on, Daddy.
Come on back.

270
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,811
Preacher lay his Bible down.

271
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:06,121
We're coming straight to you
from down in the Delta

272
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,156
with Muddy Waters and his hit record.

273
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,461
That's right. Sunshine, how you doing?

274
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:17,729
I want to say a big hello, if I can,
to everybody down in Coahoma County.

275
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,431
They got a whole mess of bluesmen
working Mississippi fields.

276
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,134
When I was out there I used to sing...

277
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:27,700
<i>Time don't get no better</i>

278
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,145
<i>Up the road I'm going</i>

279
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:33,942
So, you know,
I want to thank old Len Chess here for

280
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,277
giving Muddy Water a chance to shine.

281
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,583
Does that mean you're staying
where you are?

282
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,352
Because I know some labels down here
who'd love to snap you up.

283
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,954
Well, they can try all they want to,
but I belong to the Chess family.

284
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,790
We're gonna play a little something
from Muddy Waters right now.

285
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,389
Lay it on me.

286
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,533
It was kind, what you said on the radio.

287
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:58,632
You know, starting a business together,
it is like starting a family.

288
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,405
Appreciate that.

289
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:05,308
Yeah, well, how come, then,
you need me to sign this thing?

290
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,677
That's what people do in business.

291
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,927
You know, you got a
power with that guitar.

292
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:20,489
Amazing. It even put three women
in your bed last night.

293
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,567
Yeah, but you married.

294
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,761
I like another kind of broad.
Does that bother you?

295
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,099
What's that gonna bother me for?

296
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:31,403
I'm just saying, it doesn't make me
like them. And that's not me.

297
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,137
I'm not that.

298
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,071
Who is you?

299
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,613
Sign the contract and find out.

300
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,146
You got a pen there?

301
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,585
All right.

302
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,953
This is the newest race music
right out of Chicago.

303
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,561
And I want you to remember this name.

304
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,220
Muddy Waters.

305
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,257
The last time I signed something
like this, I got married.

306
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,700
Well, that's what this is.

307
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,772
Till death do us part.

308
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,376
By the way, the car's yours.

309
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,708
- What do you mean?
- You earned it.

310
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,768
Muddy! Listen!

311
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,339
<i>Now playing Muddy Waters'</i>
Can't Be Satisfied, <i>WGES Chicago.</i>

312
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,669
It's you!

313
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,177
- Come on in here.
- No! I got to go to work!

314
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,807
- Come on in, Mama.
- Muddy, don't! Muddy!

315
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,527
<i>On a Sunday night,</i>

316
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:08,504
<i>when no one happened
to be in Len's club,</i>

317
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:12,099
<i>the Macomba mysteriously

318
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,076

<i>He put the insurance money</i>

Hi.

321
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,355
Hi, baby. Hi, there. How you doing?

322
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,495
Look. It's coming along, huh?

323
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:40,093
- We're late on our mortgage again, Len.
- Yeah.

324
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:44,373
- It's gonna have to wait.
- You're gambling our home.

325
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:49,470
- Yeah. And we're gonna win big.
- And if we don't?

326
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,143
I won't let you down, babe.

327
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,382
I won't let you down.

328
00:25:56,488 --> 00:26:00,185
- Dave, show her the... Spin the thing.
- Sure thing.

329
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,850
You see this?

330
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,833
<i>Chess Records was the best studio</i>
<i>in Chicago.</i>

331
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,925
<i>Had a sound nobody could touch.</i>

332
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,833
Tie me up. Come on.

333
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,569
- Did everybody see?
- You guys better watch out now.

334
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,205
Little Walter getting electrified!

335
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,048
He's amplifying a fucking harmonica.

336
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:31,213
Wait, Chess. Let him try it.
Watch it now.

337
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,723
- All right. Go ahead.
- Take one.

338

344
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,879
<i>Why she left I just don't know</i>

345
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,011
Let it ride.

346
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,021
You can't record a record
with harmonica all over the place.

347
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,112
Yeah, we can.

348
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,622
<i>Forty days...</i>

349
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:08,784
Okay.

350
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,724
<i>and forty nights</i>

351
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:13,993
<i>Since I set right down and cried</i>

352
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:19,269
<i>Keep raining all the time</i>

353
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,900
<i>But the river running dry</i>

354
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:29,272
<i>Lord help me, it just ain't right</i>

355
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,248
<i>I love that girl
with all of my might</i>

356
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,021
It works.

357
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,253
Now that's a record.

358
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,828
- You like that?
- Yeah.

359
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,521
Walter got a record. Let's lay it down.

360
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:49,759
- Oh, yeah?
- You want to hear?

361
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,995
Why don't you and Jimmy back him up?

362
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:55,072
You caught me on a good day.
Where's Belo at?

363
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,640
Take one.

364
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,465
Boss, this your new shit?

365
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,232
Yeah. You like it, huh?

366
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,273
- Go park it, motherfucker.
- What?

367
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,577
Park it at your house.

368
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:40,345
Oh, Jenny, you see this shit?
Wait till these motherfuckers see me now.

369
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,285
- You my white daddy?
- You're getting carried away again.

370
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:47,791
Man, oh, man. Oh, boy.
Black folks riding around in Cadillacs.

371
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,359
Feel like I died and gone to heaven.

372
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,089
Walter, this is Willie Dixon.
He's gonna write some songs for us.

373
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,461
- How you doing?
- I like what you do with that harp, man.

374
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,261
- Wrote a killer song for you.
- You did?

375
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,597
I know how the girls love you so much.
It's called <i>My Babe.</i>

376
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:02,161
<i>My Babe?</i> This is my
babe right here. Come on, girl.

377
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,904
Hey, Len, I wrote a song for Muddy, too.

378
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,638
Oh, yeah? Muddy don't need no help.

379
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,647
Oh, man.
I admit he's good and everything,

380
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,513
but, I mean,
all his songs sound the damn same.

381
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,248
Muddy Waters needs something
that shows him off.

382
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,346
Well, we'll see what you got.

383
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,324
Here's your riff right there.

384
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,095
Ain't nothing to that.

385
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,134
<i>Gypsy woman told my mother</i>

386
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,372
<i>Before I was born</i>

387
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,273
<i>You got you a boy child coming...</i>

388
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:42,676
<i>Now Muddy was Muddy</i>
<i>way before I came along.</i>

389
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,245
<i>I just took his persona</i>

390
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,786
<i>and put it in words</i>
<i>that everybody could understand.</i>

391
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:53,422
<i>I mean, it was simple. He was
the cat every man wanted to be</i>

392
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,925
<i>and every woman wanted to love.</i>

393
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:58,293
<i>And Muddy,</i>

394
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:01,524
<i>well, he just kept
growing into that man.</i>

395
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,626
<i>Everybody knows I'm him</i>

396
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:13,841
<i>Well, you know I'm the
hoochie coochie man</i>

397
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:18,182
<i>Everybody knows I'm him</i>

398
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,557
<i>I got a black cat bone</i>

399
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,689
<i>I got a mojo, too</i>

400
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,127
<i>I got the Johnny conkeroo</i>

401
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,264
<i>I'm gonna mess with you</i>

402
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,633
<i>I'm gonna make you girls</i>

403
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,103
<i>Lead me by my hand</i>

404
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,303
<i>Then the world will know...</i>

405
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,611
<i>People started realizing</i>
<i>that if you can play the guitar</i>

406
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:54,844
<i>and sing your ass off,</i>
<i>you could be badder than Superman.</i>

407
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:59,853
<i>And that was a strong feeling</i>
<i>for a black man in the '50s.</i>

408
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,260
How you doing, darling?

409
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,172
<i>On the seventh hour</i>

410
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,377
<i>On the seventh day</i>

411
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,510
<i>On the seventh month</i>

412
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,882
<i>Seven doctors say</i>

413
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,513
<i>He was born for good luck</i>

414
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,891
<i>That you'll see</i>

415
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,152
<i>I got seven hundred dollar</i>

416
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,364
<i>Don't you mess with me</i>

417
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:48,664
I'm about to lay this down right
now, boss. I'm ready.

418
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:56,370
You're messing up my groove, boss.

419
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,785
Who dead?

420
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,690
Your mother.

421
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,826
Your family called a deejay
down in New Orleans.

422
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,328
They've been trying to find you.

423
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,800
Maybe you need to take a little time off.

424
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,439
What am I supposed to do with that, boss?

425
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,770
Go home and bury your mother.

426
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,574
Walter.

427
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,445
<i>Y'all ready?</i>

428
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,344
Shit.

429
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:40,584
I was in my groove, man.
Now I can't even find my shit.

430
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,763
Go home. Nobody's expecting you
to go back in there.

431
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,491
I'm expecting it.

432
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:54,198
You know how many harp players out there
are waiting to chop my head?

433
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,734
Not time to be wasting on this woman.

434
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:03,280
That ain't "that woman."
That's your mama, boy.

435
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,679
What the hell I know about mamas?

436
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,680
She let my daddy give me away
the day I was born.

437
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:15,122
Well, she did the best
she could, I reckon.

438
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,751
That's why this here be my mama.

439
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:21,797
This here, right here.

440
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,161
You know, Walter.

441
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:26,134
You and me not gonna wake up
every morning and get everything we want.

442
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,865
Mostly we got to take what come.

443
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:32,465
And half the time,
that's gonna be a bunch of bullshit.

444
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:38,838
Yeah. I just got to
get my mind back right.

445
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:42,781
Go on and have you a taste.

446
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,121
I don't need that.
That shit'll fuck me up.

447
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,056
- Go on, boy.
- It's gonna fuck me up, man.

448
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,592
Cool you out.

449
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,321
Just a taste, huh?

450
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,564
Fuck it.

451
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:16,113
<i>My baby don't stand
no cheating, my babe</i>

452
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:22,256
<i>Oh, yeah, she don't stand
no cheating My babe</i>

453
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,224
<i>Oh, yeah,
she don't stand no cheating</i>

454
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,493
<i>She don't stand none</i>
<i>of that midnight creeping</i>

455
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,068
I can't record this
if he handles the mike like that.

456
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,001
Don't worry about it.

457
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,771
We're playing Little
Walter's <i>My Babe.</i>

458
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,437
<i>Number one on the
charts this week.</i>

459
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,643
<i>Little Walter was making
a name for himself.</i>

460
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,018
<i>Every club on the chitlin circuit</i>

461
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,987
<i>wanted that sharp,</i>
<i>swinging jump boy in the Cadillac.</i>

462
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:56,285
Now, ain't that sure enough
a goddamn shame?

463
00:34:56,627 --> 00:35:00,063
- What is that?
- A big-time recording artist like Little Walter

464
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:04,362
driving around in that broken-down,
no-account short.

465
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,831
- Let me out.
- Hold on, son.

466
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,897
What is he doing now?

467
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:15,240
"Little Walter and the motherfucking Jukes,"
huh? Ain't this some shit?

468
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:19,214
Say, now, which one of you motherfuckers
is Little Walter?

469
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,750
I am, fool.

470
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,214
Okay.

471
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,348
Bring your ass over here!

472
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,261
Motherfucker taking
money out of my pocket.

473
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,460
So what? He's stealing your gigs.

474
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:40,434
He's stealing my name.

475
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,231
Shit.

476
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,640
<i>My baby don't stand no cheating,
my babe</i>

477
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:53,315

<i>On the music, on the cars,</i>
<i>on the women, on the life, baby.</i>

483
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,630
<i>Oh, Lord, we had hot hands!</i>

484
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:17,265

00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:24,872
<i>When she's hot, there ain't no cooling</i>

Hey, Mud. I want you to meet Wolf.

499
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:05,251
Yeah, I hear we're from the same place.

500
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,453
Is that right?

501
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:10,817
Yeah, Wolf just signed with us.

502
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,919
Yeah. Welcome to Cadillac Records.

503
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,193
You stay around long enough,
everybody get one.

504
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,464
Well, this old truck,

505
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,796
I own it.

506
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,069
It don't own me.

507
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,603
Listen, I want to offer
you a $100 advance.

508
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,478
I don't borrow against the store.

509
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,211
You just pay me what you owe me.

510
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,048
That's fair enough.

511
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,454
Nice meeting y'all.

512
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,684
Take care of yourself, baby.

513
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,296
"It don't own me."

514
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,737
Motherfucker thinks
he goddamn John Wayne.

515
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:57,933
He can sing, though.

516
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:01,375
He gonna have to, because he
ain't getting the women on style.

517
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:04,812
Any royalties come in
from <i>Hoochie Coochie Man?</i>

518
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:07,145
I already gave that to you.

519
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,410
How you figure?

520
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,419
The Cadillac ain't free, Mud.

521
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:16,753
Right.

522
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:18,953
You need money?

523
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,729
Well, Geneva want a house.

524
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,737
I'll take care of it.

525
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,272
All right.

526
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,172
<i>All you pretty women</i>

527
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,274
<i>Stand in line</i>

528
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:40,650
<i>I can make love to you, baby</i>

529
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,711
<i>In an hour's time</i>

530
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,022
<i>Ain't that amazing?</i>

531
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,869
Where that baby come from?

532
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,016
A woman came by today.

533
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,683
She said she's yours.

534
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:19,587
She said she couldn't take care
of her anymore.

535
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,453
That's my baby?

536
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,729
She's gonna need milk.

537
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,746
I'll go on and get the milk.

538
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,649
<i>I'm a man</i>

539
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,586
<i>I spell M...</i>

540
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,093
This here be a real nice home
you're making, Geneva.

541
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,536
Thank you, Walter.

542
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,240
That's why Muddy can go out there
and fetch the world.

543
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:51,280
He's got big dreams.

544
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,350
Here, let me help you.

545
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,451
- There, go ahead...
- What about you, though? Come on.

546
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,955
You ain't got no dreams, girl?

547
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:03,288
Somebody's got to have their feet
firmly planted on the ground.

548
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,919
That's you, huh? That's you?

549
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:09,364
Well, I say you take them off the ground.

550
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,558
Taking care of all these kids.

551
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,264
You know, you gone
and made a place for me to lay my head.

552
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:17,567
Now, come here, now. Stop for a minute.

553
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,109
Stop for a minute, now. Come here.
Play with me. Come on.

554
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,644
Come on. Come on.

555
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,235
Have a seat. Come on.

556
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:26,339
Kick your feet up now.
Here go your drink.

557
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,217
It's nice, right?

558
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,689
Who be taking care of you?

559
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:45,361
I see you running around here
taking care of everybody. You know?

560
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,065
Who take care of Geneva?

561
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:56,713
- Walter.
- What? What?

562
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:59,408
- I'm Muddy's woman.
- He got a lot of women.

563
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,410
He can spare one, huh?

564
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,986
I'm sorry. I know.

565
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:10,019
I know I'm a motherfucker. I know.

566
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,991
You got no idea. I can't help myself.
I want to...

567
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:16,692
I just want to see you happy, Geneva.
You know?

568
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,563
Let me make you happy, baby.

569
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,967
I love him.

570
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,508
You have no idea

571
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,751
how good that man has been to me.

572
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,622
I'm half a woman, Walter.

573
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,864
I can't have any more babies.

574
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:57,637
I can't give Muddy any
children of his own.

575
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,905
- Don't cry, baby. Don't cry.
- No.

576
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:06,646
Don't ever talk to me
about any of his other women.

577
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:08,549
Ever.

578
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:09,778
Okay.

579
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,388
Hey, Geneva.

580
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,315
Hey, baby.

581
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:20,328
You must be hungry.
Let me make you something to eat.

582
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,165
Yeah.

583
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,065
What, you ain't hungry?

584
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:02,865
He ain't hungry.

585
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,035
You ain't hungry?

586
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,981
You ain't eat nothing.
What, you ain't hungry?

587
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,448
- Son?
- Muddy.

588
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,583
You ain't hungry? Son?

589
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,519
- Muddy, he's just a kid!
- You better know I know it.

590
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,191
I'll put a motherfucking
lacing on you, boy.

591
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:31,893
Now, you better go on somewhere
and sleep it off. You hear me?

592
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:05,724
<i>Oh, smokestack lightning</i>

593
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:07,995
<i>Shining...</i>

594
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,665
<i>Cut.</i>

595
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:12,571
<i>You on the guitar,
what's your name?</i>

596
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:13,870
Hubert, sir.

597
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,308
<i>"Hubert"?</i>

598
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:17,677
<i>Walter, behave yourself.</i>

599
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:19,681
<i>- Motherfucker's name is Hubert.</i>
<i>- Shut up.</i>

600
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,650
<i>Who do you think you are,</i>
<i>playing that loud?</i>

601
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:25,381
Yeah, lower the amp, not the guitar.
The amp.

602
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,389
<i>Get it right, Hubert.</i>

603
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,618
Don't talk to him no more.

604
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,692
I'm the band leader.

605
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:37,658
Reckon you ain't never
worked with one before.

606
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:43,432
You want something done, you ask me.
I'm gonna tell him what he has to be doing.

607
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,269
Is that right?

608
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:48,938
That's right.

609
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:53,278
Only thing you can do. That's a
mean motherfucker right there. Shit.

610
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,776
Get it right.

611
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:58,882
- All right, big man.
- Go and get your coat.

612
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,183
Okay, then.

613
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,655
<i>Take two.</i>

614
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,617
Hey, baby.

615
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:07,426
Why don't you stay for a while?

616
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:10,159
Better get your girl out of the ring.

617
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:24,303
<i>Oh, smokestack lightning</i>

618
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:27,611
No, that's all right.
You can have her, baby.

619
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:30,115
But she come with this.

620
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,156
- He can't hear you, Mud.
- I guarantee you he hear me.

621
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,734
Hey, Jimmy, come here.

622
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:54,838
I want you to tell Hubert we'll pay
him twice what Wolf's paying him.

623
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,640
If he's such a band leader,

624
00:46:56,747 --> 00:47:00,410
we'll see if he's band leader enough
to hold onto his boy.

625
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,652
<i>He was the big, bad wolf.</i>

626
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:09,248
<i>Now, the story is he got his name</i>
<i>from a dead man</i>

627
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,522
<i>who came out the cemetery</i>
<i>and tuned his guitar.</i>

628
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:15,826
<i>And he been howling</i>
<i>at the moon ever since.</i>

629
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:19,300
<i>Oh, stop your train</i>

630
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:24,207
<i>Let a poor boy ride</i>

631
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,243
<i>Whoa, don't you hear me crying?</i>

632
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:36,946
- You all right?
- Couldn't you get a smaller set?

633
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:40,914
- You all right?
- Hurry up, man.

634
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,720
- I don't want to miss this game, now.
- Oh, baby!

635
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,025
I love this house.

636
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,721
- You got it.
- Sorry, Jimmy.

637
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,291
Y'all can't come in here.

638
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:53,861
I'm Chuck Berry.

639
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:56,735
Chuck Berry's a
country-and-western singer.

640
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:00,473
Is he?

641
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,269
You know who else he is? He's me.

642
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,188
Says he's Chuck Berry.

643
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:21,821
Let me see some ID.

644
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,898
All right, then.

645
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,095
ID.

646
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:34,706
This license says you're Indian.
That pinup make you look like a white man.

647
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,972
- What the hell are you?
- I'm a musician.

648
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,809
And my name is Chuck Berry.

649
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,885
And I can be whatever you need me to be

650
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:45,421

651
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,490
You part con man, too?

652
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,285
No.

653
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,490
You may sing country.

654
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:54,255
You ain't doing it here.

655
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:00,865
- Get on, now.
- You gentlemen have a fine evening.

656
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,202
ID.

657
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:20,352
What happened to your doors?

658
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,424
It was hot, so I took them off.

659
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,825
It's all right. Come on, baby.

660
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,591
- Come on, girl.
- Thank you.

661
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,059
Let me see your license.

662
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:37,038
Okay. Okay.
Here, you take a look at this here.

663
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,937
I'm about to go wax this record, okay?

664
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:41,738
Get your ass back over here, nigger.

665
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:51,112
Now, you looking at my license, huh?

666
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:55,021
You guys know that "nigger" ain't
the name my mama gave me, now.

667
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,425
Oh, pardon. I'm sorry.

668
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:02,423
These motherfuckers can't read.

669
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:05,092
Okay. Let me help you out.
You got to sound that shit out.

670
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,968
Come on.

671
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:10,500
"Walter."

672
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,632
Mud! The cops got Walter!

673
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:16,003
- Hey, take it easy!
- Nigger.

674
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:17,273
Come on. He works here.

675
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,281
- He works here. Take it easy.
- This here nigger?

676
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:22,284
- You feel like a nigger yet?
- Hey! Look.

677
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,916
- Look. Please.
- You see that?

678
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,014
Do you see that?
I belong to the Chess family.

679
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:32,028
- Motherfucker!
- Hey!

680
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:35,391
You're gonna need a new car, nigger.

681
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,566
That's what I've been
telling this motherfucker.

682
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:41,694
Shut up, shut up. Would you stop?
Are you fucking with cops now?

683
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:43,033
God damn it.

684
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:45,971
What's the matter with you?

685
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:50,076
- Are you all right, man?
- Damn it.

686
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,081
I had no business being
that pretty anyway.

687
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:59,521
It looks like I need a new car, Len.

688
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:02,956
I gave you a new car.
You rip the fucking doors off it?

689
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,357
It's not my problem!

690
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:06,486
I gave you a number-one record, Len.

691
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:09,064
I gave you a chance to make
a number-one fucking record.

692
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,327
Oh, you gave the little nigger
a chance, huh?

693
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:13,926
Little nigger don't need no chance!

694
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:16,969
I can play, motherfucker!

695
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,099
I'm fucking king on this shit!

696
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:21,109
You think I'm gonna shoot you?

697
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:24,112
- Get some rest.
- No, I need a new car.

698
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:28,582
Enough! What you need to do
is get back to the Pepsi-Cola, boy.

699
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,677
Let me tell you,
that liquor ain't for you.

700
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:34,552
What you gonna do, Mud?
You gonna hit me, Mud?

701
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:37,388
You gonna choke me now? On the street?

702
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:40,186
Get off me.

703
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,867
You know,

704
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,169
that Wolf,

705
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:51,735
the way he stood up for his sideman,

706
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:56,371
maybe he could teach you something, Mud.

707
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,479
Esther, come on!

708
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:08,918
Find yourself another harp player.

709
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:20,035
<i>Well, baby, you know</i>
<i>I can never be satisfied</i>

710
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,739
<i>And I just can't keep from crying</i>

711
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,300
<i>Lay it on, man.</i>

712
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,410
<i>Hubert Sumlin,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

713
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:07,109
- What you want, miss?
- Tell Pot that I ain't leaving.

714
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:09,549
Pot! Your girl said she ain't leaving.

715
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:13,316
I want your things out of my room
when I get home. I told you.

716
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:21,155
You can't hide from the eye of God.

717
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,966
He hunting heads tonight.

718
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:41,906
Muddy, I don't think
I want to be in your band no more.

719
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,347
You steal him from me again,

720
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,180
I'll kill you.

721
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:55,357
He tell you I quit?

722
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:58,730
He said he felt like
somebody took away his oxygen.

723
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,198
Walter.

724
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,430
You're family.

725
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,634
You don't have to do this.

726
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,311
I'm gonna miss you.

727
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:38,534
<i>When you lose that cat that gave you</i>
<i>that sound that nobody else could,</i>

728
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:41,271
<i>it hurts.</i>

729
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,778
<i>Hurts more than losing your woman.</i>

730
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,728
It's good you brought him in.

731
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:00,921
See what I was telling you, baby?

732
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,658
He's different.

733
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,530
I don't know, Len.
He sound a little country to me.

734
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,535
Maybe we blues him up just a little bit.

735
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,797
Willie.

736
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:12,805
I don't want you to blues this up.
This ain't the blues.

737
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:16,367
I don't know what the fuck it is,
but we're gonna record it.

738
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,106
- There you go, baby.
- Yeah.

739
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,596
Hey. Hey there, girl.

740
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:41,667
Tell Chess

741
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:45,734
I need a new car.

742
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:48,807
This ain't the right color.

743
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,911
You got something real special.

744
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:59,352
Thank you, Mr. Freed. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

745
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,324
Do you think you'll be able to play it?

746
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:07,556
If I play it, I make
you famous and him rich.

747
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:10,792
The question is, how bad do you want it?

748
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,927
I'm sorry.
You said, me famous and him rich? Yeah?

749
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,967
Well, hold on. One second. One second.

750
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:21,475
Let me switch sides
with you for a moment.

751
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:23,239
Chuck's a bit of a comedian.

752
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:26,106
- Well, this is nice.
- Yeah.

753
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,810
- This is very nice.
- I'm sure we can work something out.

754
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:32,183
Now, some of you people
might call this race music.

755
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:36,122
I call it rock and roll, and it's
too fun for anybody to sit out on,

756
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,887
white or colored.

757
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:41,560
- Did he just say what I think he said?
- Yeah.

758
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:44,258
He just integrated the airwaves.

759
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:48,303
- Here we are.
- Here we are, motherfucker. Here we are.

760
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:51,306
- Oh, God.
- Mr. Waters, I am deeply grateful to you.

761
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,705
You got it, baby.

762
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:11,717
<i>Riding along in my automobile</i>

763
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:15,487
<i>I was anxious to tell
her the way I feel</i>

764
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,027
<i>So I told her softly and sincere</i>

765
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,763
<i>Chuck was playing in
segregated cities.</i>

766
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:29,039
<i>But there was just a thin rope</i>
<i>to separate coloreds from whites.</i>

767
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,838
<i>And a whole lot of history.</i>

768
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:45,186
<i>And that's all it took
to bring us all together,</i>

769
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,287
<i>one man duck-walking across stage.</i>

770
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:49,490
<i>Shit.</i>

771
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:53,429
Please keep the aisles clear.

772
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:56,135
Get back over here.

773
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:58,036
Keep the aisles clear.

774
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:17,683
Why don't you play like that, Daddy?

775
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:21,355
- Ain't nothing but the blues sped up.
- It's rock and roll.

776
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:24,759
Look at that car!

777
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:29,829
Len Chess got two hot cars.

778
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,099
Hey, Muddy. Hey, Charles.

779
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:35,734
We're on <i>American Bandstand.</i>
You believe this?

780
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:39,281
- There's the man. Been a long time.
- Chuck Berry!

781
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:41,907
- Hey, is this the boy?
- Yeah, that's Charles.

782
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,315
That's your car outside?

783
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:44,886
The cherry-red one out there?

784
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:46,956
It's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

785
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,422
Ain't it? Good taste.

786
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,654
- Sit down, Charles. Have a seat.
- Chuck Berry.

787
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:55,924
Charles, Charlie, Chuck.

788
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:59,435
Mortgage payment
and child support killing me.

789
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,797
And I ain't booking the clubs enough.

790
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,502
Len, I was talking to the accountant,

791
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:10,409
and he been telling me
I'm borrowing against my royalties.

792
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:13,004
Len, Mud, it's coming.
You're gonna miss it.

793
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:14,242
Yeah. In a minute.

794
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:17,615
What's going on?
I thought I was just getting paid.

795
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:23,689
Records ain't selling.

796
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:27,993
Is that how come you got
a brand-new Cadillac in the driveway?

797
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,756
He bought me that Cadillac.

798
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:34,960
Me, you and every other motherfucker

799
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:38,700
cashes a Chess Records check
is riding that man's coattails.

800
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:40,537
And that ain't good.

801
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:42,366
Thank you.

802
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:45,345
In my book, you're still number one.

803
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:47,539
You, too, baby.

804
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:50,079
Hey, Dad, you got to see this.

805
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:07,960
<i>They were locking up fine black
women for sitting on buses,</i>

806
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:12,269
<i>stringing up our little bitty boys</i>
<i>for whistling at white women.</i>

807
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:16,443
<i>Not paying any mind
at all to old Chuck,</i>

808
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:20,642
<i>who was reaping up their firstborn</i>
<i>with this thing called rock and roll.</i>

809
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:35,489
<i>$3,000 in his pocket</i>
<i>and he'd be eating like a hobo.</i>

810
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:39,056
<i>But he'd do that before he'd give
them crackers one damn dollar.</i>

811
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,229
<i>Chuck'd rather
sleep in his own car</i>

812
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:45,796
<i>than to give his money</i>
<i>to one of them segregated hotels.</i>

813
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:55,845
<i>The man saved $100,000
the first year.</i>

814
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:58,750
<i>Now, he didn't drink,</i>
<i>and, no, he didn't gamble.</i>

815
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:01,847
<i>He only had one particular vice.</i>

816
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,984
- Good evening, ladies.
- You're him, aren't you?

817
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:08,887
Well, what "him" are you looking for?

818
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,192
You know.

819
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:14,561
How do you know I know?

820
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,104
I know everything.

821
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:19,368
Would you mind coming to teach me
what you know?

822
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:22,468
I'll teach you everything.

823
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:30,847
<i>Now, Chuck wasn't the only one</i>
<i>looking for female talent.</i>

824
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:33,046
<i>Len was on a girl-hunt, too.</i>

825
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,321
Here she is.

826
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,359
Glad you could make it.

827
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,360
I can get you a drink...

828
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,732
What, you want me to just do it
right here? Right now?

829
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:47,735
Well, I am leaving town tomorrow.

830
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,998
Yeah, baby,
you don't have to be shy with him.

831
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:51,698
I ain't shy, fool.

832
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:59,442
Don't be looking at me
like I ain't wearing no drawers!

833
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,484
It's just hard to do if
you ain't in the mood.

834
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:04,519
And I ain't in the mood.

835
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:08,321
She ain't in the mood.

836
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,623
Come on.

837
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:15,787
I thought you said this broad was good.

838
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:19,095
<i>I heard</i>

839
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:23,997
<i>Church bells ring</i>

840
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,808
<i>I heard</i>

841
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:32,714
<i>A choir singing</i>

842
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:37,213
<i>I saw my love</i>

843
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,183
<i>Walk down the aisle</i>

844
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:44,721
<i>On her finger</i>

845
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:47,963
<i>He placed the ring</i>

846
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:52,327
<i>He was looking for a woman that could
go head-to-head with his men.</i>

847
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:55,167
<i>And he found her.</i>

848
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,637
<i>Miss Etta James.</i>

849
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,901
- Hey, Mud.
- You got it, baby.

850
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:02,102
When do I get you back in here?

851
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:04,475
You ain't heard?
My records ain't selling.

852
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,911
You're always gonna sell, baby.

853
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:07,243
Cut.

854
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,350
What's going on with
sweet baby girl there?

855
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,579
Sweet?

856
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:15,654
<i>Fuck you, Leonard. What the
hell you know about the blues?</i>

857
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:19,387
I gave you a damn good track.
You want it? You sing it.

858
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:21,690
Now she want me to sing it.
Fine, go home.

859
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,232
Forget it. Everybody go home.
That's a wrap.

860
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:26,392
What are you smiling about?

861
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:29,327
My mistake.
You ain't woman enough for that song.

862
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:31,235
- I'm plenty woman.
- Oh, yeah?

863
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,638
It's about being in love.
You know what that is?

864
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:35,210
- I know about love.
- Yeah?

865
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,711
Motherfucker ever walk out on you?

866
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:42,015
Fucking not only did he walk out on you,
he's taking the other broad down the aisle.

867
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:44,609
You know what that feels like, baby?

868
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:53,791
Give me another one.

869
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,799
You heard her. She wants another one.

870
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,094
<i>Take 15.</i>

871
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:09,975
<i>I heard</i>

872
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,537
<i>Church bells ring</i>

873
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:17,311
<i>I heard</i>

874
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:20,480
<i>A choir singing</i>

875
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:25,823
<i>I saw my love</i>

876
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:29,591
<i>Walk down the aisle</i>

877
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,293
<i>On her finger</i>

878
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:35,670
<i>He placed a ring</i>

879
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:39,867
<i>Oh, I saw them</i>

880
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,876
<i>Holding hands</i>

881
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:47,712
<i>She was standing there</i>

882
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:51,309
<i>With my man</i>

883
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:56,319
<i>I heard them promise</i>

884
01:04:57,126 --> 01:05:00,289
<i>Till death do us part</i>

885
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,558
<i>Each word</i>

886
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:06,362
<i>Was a pain in my heart</i>

887
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:11,197
<i>Oh, all I could do</i>

888
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:15,133
<i>All I could do was cry</i>

889
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:19,976
<i>All I could do</i>

890
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:23,245
<i>Was cry</i>

891
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:28,023
<i>I was losing</i>

892
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:31,719
<i>The man that I loved</i>

893
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:35,490
<i>And all I could do</i>

894
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:38,431
<i>Was cry</i>

895
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:42,095
<i>And now</i>

896
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,931
<i>The wedding is over</i>

897
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:50,837
<i>The rice, rice has been thrown</i>

898
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,110
<i>Over their heads</i>

899
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:59,412
<i>For them life</i>

900
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:03,049
<i>Has just begun</i>

901
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:05,252
<i>But mine</i>

902
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:08,728
<i>Is ending</i>

903
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,173
You play a mean game of pool.

904
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:31,817
Listen, if I brought up bad memories,
I'm sorry.

905
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:34,219
But it was good for the song.

906
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,848
This album comes out,
that old boyfriend will come running.

907
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:39,427
I wasn't crying over no boyfriend.

908
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:40,654
Oh, no?

909
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:43,129
Girlfriend?

910
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:48,927
How'd you learn to play pool so good?

911
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:50,335
My daddy.

912
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:55,805
- Can I get a whiskey?
- Sure thing, boss.

913
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:57,276
That's good.

914
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:00,849
Hard to find time to
teach your kids things.

915
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:03,680
He ain't teach me shit. I taught myself.

916
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,548
I don't want to embarrass him
when we meet.

917
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:09,385
Tell you who's gonna be embarrassed
is your old man.

918
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:11,824
Because he's gonna meet
a goddamn superstar.

919
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:13,121
You know?

920
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,827
And what is he?

921
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:17,660
A nobody. Now,

922
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,894
I don't want to embarrass you,
but let me show you how it's done.

923
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:25,463
You're batting a thousand on being wrong.
You see that picture over there?

924
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,345
What, Minnesota Fats is your father?

925
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:34,774
That's the story.

926
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:42,681
You ought to have him come by the studio.

927
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:45,317
I ain't never even met that motherfucker.

928
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:50,058
But when I do,
I want it to be in a fancy restaurant

929
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:52,930
where everybody wants my picture
and asking me for my autograph.

930
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:55,401
- That's the dream, huh?
- That's my dream.

931
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:57,062
It's not a dream.

932
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,098
You're gonna cross over.

933
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:01,199
- You think?
- Promise.

934
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:05,237
You gonna promise me
that fancy restaurant, too?

935
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:07,409
Promise.

936
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:12,143
The one that's gonna serve the white man
and his colored daughter.

937
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:16,724
Hey, come on.

938
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,153
You sing the blues.
You don't have to live them.

939
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:24,331
What the fuck do you know, white boy?

940
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:31,933
Yeah, you play that hard act real good.

941
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:36,010
But I see you.

942
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,281
I see you.

943
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:59,563
<i>Old Len thought his checkbook</i>
<i>can fix anything,</i>

944
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:02,398
<i>so he bought out the
restaurant for Etta.</i>

945
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:05,303
<i>But there's some
things money can't fix.</i>

946
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,272
I can't help you, kid.

947
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,742
Gin. Can I have a bottle of gin?

948
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,512
I need a bottle of gin.

949
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:16,846
Gin, please. Can I have a bottle of gin?

950
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:21,052
Gin! Can I get a fucking bottle of gin?

951
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:25,325
- Come on. Bottle of gin.
- Right away, sir.

952
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:28,089
I guess I got to be him to get some gin?

953
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:39,933
- What'd he say to you?
- Stupid shit.

954
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:42,442
He didn't even ask if
he could see me again.

955
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:44,410
That's his problem.
Why you making it yours?

956
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:46,481
Here you go, sir.

957
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:49,676
You wouldn't even begin to know
my problems, baby.

958
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,347
Let me.

959
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:01,192
My mother was a whore.

960
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:09,599
And that fat motherfucker just looked me
in my face, and he didn't see himself.

961
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:13,870
He didn't see his little girl.
You know what he saw?

962
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:19,477
He saw the cum stains
of all the other men my mother fucked.

963
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:24,344
These chanda-fucking-liers and these
white tablecloths don't mean shit!

964
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:26,751
I ain't gonna ever be
good enough for him.

965
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:29,221
You know they're gonna break this
when I leave, right?

966
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:31,293
Fuck it! I'll do it for you!

967
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:33,520
Come on, honey. Listen to me.

968
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,727
You can't let that in.

969
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,958
You know, Muddy,

970
01:10:40,836 --> 01:10:43,361
he sings that hurt. He don't live it.

971
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:46,566
He don't nurse it.

972
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:51,009
Walter, he carries it around like a baby.

973
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:53,308
Feeds it on whiskey and smack.

974
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:56,913
You got to let it go.

975
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:05,254
I can't.

976
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:27,909
Oh, no.

977
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:30,450
No, I'm not having it.

978
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:37,215
That's my song.

979
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:40,922
- No, darling.
- No, no, darling.

980
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:43,958
That's my song.

981
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:45,829
No, darling. That's the Beach Boys.

982
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:51,834
That is <i>Sweet Sixteen,</i>
note for note.

983
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:54,606
Note for note. Not one change.

984
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:58,578
Aside, apart from the lyrics,
about the new...

985
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:03,618
The new craze sweeping the nation
for young white boys and girls, surfing.

986
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:06,950
I've provided them the soundtrack,
unbeknownst to myself.

987
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:08,819
<i>- You ready?</i>
- Yes, I'm ready.

988
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:13,190
I'm very ready to make more songs
for the Beach Boys

989
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:17,865
and all other manner of white folks
to steal. Yes, I'm quite ready.

990
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:20,127
- You say the devil's name, he appears.
- We need to talk.

991
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:24,194
Yeah, we do need to talk. You heard this?
You know what's going on?

992
01:12:24,306 --> 01:12:26,638
- Do you know what's going on?
- I'm not laying down for this.

993
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:30,576
First, Alan Freed gets
a third of <i>Maybelline.</i> For what?

994
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:31,703
Chuck, listen.

995
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:35,807
No. You listen to me.
Did he write one part of the song?

996
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:37,749
- One part?
- Alan Freed put us on the map.

997
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,184
This gives him the license...

998
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:41,119
Did you take an underage white girl
across state lines?

999
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:44,624
I'm not talking about girls.
What's going on?

1000
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:49,394
- Don't say shit. Don't say anything.
- Hello, Officers. Is there a problem?

1001
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:52,365
Mr. Berry, you are under arrest
for transporting a minor

1002
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:55,960
across state lines
for the purpose of prostitution.

1003
01:12:56,071 --> 01:13:01,008
First of all, I didn't transport anyone
anywhere. I didn't solicit anything.

1004
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:05,206
Gentlemen, I'll have you know that
my very dear friend Mr. Jerry Lee Lewis

1005
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:06,838
- has a 13-year-old wife.
- Keep your mouth shut.

1006
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:09,975
Are we stopping by his home on the way?
Emmett Till gets murdered

1007
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:12,986
for whistling at a white woman.
I know you're pleased to get Chuck Berry.

1008
01:13:13,088 --> 01:13:14,715
Fix this, Leonard.

1009
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:26,599
You guys got to be kidding me, man.
Where are you from?

1010
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:28,727
You set that hair in the morning?

1011
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:32,136
You ladies shouldn't be out here
without an escort.

1012
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:35,836
<i>A bunch of English boys started</i>
<i>playing our music.</i>

1013
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:38,071
<i>Now, it was made in America,</i>

1014
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:41,274
<i>but I guess nobody thought</i>
<i>we were Americans.</i>

1015
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:43,977
Hey, let me help you with that, fellow.

1016
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:47,647
Fucking hell. It's him!

1017
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:50,554
Mr. Waters.

1018
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:52,286
We're big fans.

1019
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:54,157
You're the reason we got together.

1020
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:56,629
We named our band
after one of your songs.

1021
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:58,859
- Yeah?
<i>- Rolling Stone.</i>

1022
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,570
All right.

1023
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:05,333
Go on in there. Fuck them police.

1024
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:09,138
<i>Everybody knows the Rolling Stones,</i>
<i>the Beatles, Fleetwood Mac,</i>

1025
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:13,146
<i>Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton.</i>
<i>Everybody know them names, right?</i>

1026
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:18,147
Skinny motherfuckers.

1027
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,521
The Rolling Stones
are burning up the charts

1028
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:23,853
with an old Muddy Waters standard.

1029
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:31,961
Take 10% of Chuck's royalties
and move them to Muddy. Go on and do it.

1030
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:34,892
Chuck ain't gonna miss it.

1031
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:41,407
<i>The goose that laid the golden egg</i>
<i>was locked up.</i>

1032
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:48,173
<i>So Len brought in the old standbys,</i>
<i>including Little Walter.</i>

1033
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:50,513
<i>Chess was desperate for a hit.</i>

1034
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:53,986
Oh, hey, little girl, now.
Who you belong to, huh?

1035
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:57,353
- You mind if I watch?
- Go ahead, baby girl.

1036
01:14:57,459 --> 01:14:59,984
- I grew up on y'all's music.
- Watch?

1037
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:01,585
Come over here.

1038
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:04,390
I'll teach you to blow, baby.

1039
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:08,197
Better watch it, baby girl.
He ain't talking about that harp.

1040
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:10,100
Muddy, you're a fool.

1041
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:14,171
I wouldn't mind a little bit of
what you flying on.

1042
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:18,207
You too pretty to be flying my way, now.

1043
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:21,182
You don't need that amp.

1044
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:25,745
- How they gonna hear me?
- Everybody's records are getting sent back.

1045
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:28,721
You want to survive, do
something different. Play along.

1046
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:31,019
Something different? What the fuck?

1047
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:32,184
What?

1048
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:35,992
Mud, what you think about this?

1049
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:39,429
What you think about this, Mud?

1050
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,970
I think we need to lay this record.

1051
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,440
What, I'm just a sideman now?

1052
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,980
Okay, I'll do it, Len. I'll do it.

1053
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:04,047
I'm broke as the rest of you
motherfuckers in here, so, you know?

1054
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:08,022
I'm gonna need a bottle of gin, though.

1055
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:10,223
I'm gonna need a bottle of gin, baby.

1056
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:13,495
Because I like a taste
before getting fucked.

1057
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:15,900
Somebody taking care of Walter?

1058
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:19,430
That's right. Take care of me, baby.

1059
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:51,172
<i>At last</i>

1060
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:59,146
<i>My love has come along</i>

1061
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:07,215
<i>My lonely days are over</i>

1062
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:15,021
<i>And life is like a song</i>

1063
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:20,095
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1064
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:23,461
<i>At last</i>

1065
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:31,606
<i>The skies above are blue</i>

1066
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:40,349
<i>My heart was wrapped up in clover</i>

1067
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:48,162
<i>The night I looked at you</i>

1068
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:57,302
<i>I found a dream</i>

1069
01:17:57,706 --> 01:18:01,073
<i>That I could speak to</i>

1070
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:05,779
<i>A dream that I

1071
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:09,112
<i>Can call my own</i>

1072
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:13,984
<i>I found a thrill</i>

1073
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:17,547
<i>To press my cheek to</i>

1074
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:22,395
<i>A thrill that I

1075
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:25,057
<i>Have never known</i>

1076
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:27,260
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1077
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:30,031
<i>When you smiled</i>

1078
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:32,732
<i>You smiled</i>

1079
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:38,711
<i>Oh, and then the spell was cast</i>

1080
01:18:41,917 --> 01:18:47,355
<i>And here we are in heaven</i>

1081
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:55,460
<i>For you are mine</i>

1082
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:58,499
<i>At last</i>

1083
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:02,693
- Thanks, baby.
- You got it.

1084
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:06,700
- Happy anniversary, Revetta.
- Thank you.

1085
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:09,504
- Where you taking her, Peppers?
- Get out of here.

1086
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:14,674
WVJN just called.
Etta missed her airtime again.

1087
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:18,719
God damn, it's the third time this week.
This broad, I'm gonna...

1088
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:26,491
I'm sorry, babe. I got to go
figure out what's going on here.

1089
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,187
Don't worry about it.
I'll go look in on her.

1090
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:29,661
That ain't your job, Mud.

1091
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:30,891
Chess.

1092
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,030
Go on and enjoy yourself.

1093
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:31,123
Now, wake up, girl. Wake up.
Look here, wake up!

1094
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:33,251
What the... What... What you...

1095
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:35,295
Come here. Stand up.

1096
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:36,887
Get up, God damn it, come on.

1097
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:39,899
- Stand up. Get up.
- Hey, baby.

1098
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:42,697
- Come on, now.
- You came to see me?

1099
01:20:42,804 --> 01:20:44,431
- He fucked up my hair.
- I'm going to get a doctor.

1100
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:46,666
No doctors.

1101
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:49,539
Let me get Geneva then.
She knows what to do with this.

1102
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:51,509
All right, that's good.

1103
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:54,980
Wake up. Baby, come on, wake up.

1104
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:57,278
Wake up, come on.
It's not funny. Come on.

1105
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:02,882
This the first time I
ever used this fireplace.

1106
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:07,353
Feel like I should be having
marshmallows or something.

1107
01:21:07,462 --> 01:21:11,125
Yeah, I'm sure marshmallows
and smack go real well together.

1108
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:15,866
What happened to the furniture?

1109
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:18,496
Where's the car?

1110
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:23,273
My mama sold what didn't get repossessed.

1111
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:26,805
They gonna take my house.

1112
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:28,439
Oh, that's good.

1113
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:35,349
Come on.

1114
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:39,956
You got to put it in my name.

1115
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:45,559
You hear me? You gonna trust me?
Put the house in my name.

1116
01:21:46,668 --> 01:21:48,761
What? What?

1117
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,135
Trust me.

1118
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:55,604
<i>Trust in me</i>

1119
01:21:57,812 --> 01:22:01,179
<i>In all you do</i>

1120
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:02,443
Listen.

1121
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:07,319
Listen to me. I'm gonna get you
in a clinic and get some help.

1122
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:11,588
I'm gonna pay for it.

1123
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,589
It's not a loan. It's a gift.

1124
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:16,425
So, now you buying me gifts?

1125
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:18,431
Yeah, that's right.

1126
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:20,797
I must be real special.

1127
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:26,536
I must make you a lot of money.

1128
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,266
Yeah, that must be it.

1129
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:30,867
I ain't stupid.

1130
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:36,076
I'm your number-one bitch
since Chuck got busted.

1131
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:39,620
- I'm trying to take care of you.
- You gonna take care of me?

1132
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:44,090
Who the fuck you think you talking to,
your tight-ass wife?

1133
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:46,959
That's off-limits.

1134
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:49,724
I don't need no man to take care of me.

1135
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:53,767
So tough. You look so fucking good.
With these track marks in your arm?

1136
01:22:53,868 --> 01:22:57,395
That's real good. Well, that's good.
Yeah, that'll fix your problems, huh?

1137
01:22:57,505 --> 01:22:59,632
Baby, don't worry.

1138
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:03,000
Etta ain't gonna hurt you.

1139
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:09,781
That feels nice. It feel real good.
Who bought you that?

1140
01:23:09,884 --> 01:23:14,685
Did Etta buy you that? I think she did.
Who bought you that car?

1141
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:18,390
I think I got that
nice car out there, too.

1142
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:21,860
Don't worry.

1143
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:25,855
- I'll do it for you, baby.
- Come on. Stop that.

1144
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:30,028
Just say, "Trust in me,"
like all them other motherfuckers...

1145
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:33,198
Come on, I ain't taking from you!
I'm offering.

1146
01:23:33,808 --> 01:23:38,245
God damn it, I don't know what the fuck
to say to you. I'm not your fucking pimp.

1147
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,314
- That's not us.
- "Us"?

1148
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,548
What the fuck is "us"?

1149
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,252
A white man and a black girl?

1150
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:52,391
I been there.

1151
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:55,556
Yeah, but you ain't been here.

1152
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:01,830
I'm not your father.

1153
01:24:05,974 --> 01:24:07,965
And you ain't your mother.

1154
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:13,471
And I ain't gonna hurt you.

1155
01:24:15,483 --> 01:24:17,542
I got no reason to hurt you.

1156
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:23,755
You don't even know what you have.

1157
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:26,360
What do I have?

1158
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:33,228
You got a hit record.

1159
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:35,559
What?

1160
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:38,104
You're on top of the charts, baby.

1161
01:24:39,307 --> 01:24:40,899
You crossed over.

1162
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:43,071
Len, I crossed over?

1163
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:44,810
I told you.

1164
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:05,422
Geneva a nurse.

1165
01:25:07,869 --> 01:25:09,234
Hello, Etta.

1166
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:10,571
Hi.

1167
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:21,615
Are you sure you want Geneva to stay here
or you want her to come home with me?

1168
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:26,084
It's not what you think.

1169
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:29,480
Oh, this is just business?

1170
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:33,285
- That's right.
- You never hold me like that.

1171
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:35,794
Cross over and I'll
jump into bed with you.

1172
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:39,060
I bet you'd jump out
that motherfucker quick, too.

1173
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:48,535
What?

1174
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:53,205
What?

1175
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,572
You know how Walter call you
his white daddy,

1176
01:25:55,683 --> 01:26:00,052
because every time he step in shit,
you there to get him out of trouble?

1177
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:04,317
And then you bring him in the studio
and you take away his amp,

1178
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:06,859
the sound that took him
his whole life to make up.

1179
01:26:06,961 --> 01:26:11,421
Any other motherfucker he'd have shot
for that, but he give it up for you.

1180
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:16,395
What you telling that little girl
ain't got nobody in the world?

1181
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:18,870
That you're gonna take care of her?

1182
01:26:18,973 --> 01:26:20,565
How many strung-out
girls you told that to?

1183
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:24,668
I ain't talking about me. I'm talking
about you and the baby girl in there.

1184
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:28,215
- What if I told you I had feelings for her?
- Bullshit.

1185
01:26:31,986 --> 01:26:33,351
Fine.

1186
01:26:33,454 --> 01:26:37,288
I'm fucking her, I'm fucking Chuck,
and I'm fucking you. Huh?

1187
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:40,118
That's what you think, huh?

1188
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:42,926
Ain't that what you think, Mud?

1189
01:26:45,266 --> 01:26:49,202
Well, that's what the blues is, ain't it?
A whole lot of fucking.

1190
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:52,897
Tell Geneva I'm gone.

1191
01:26:58,846 --> 01:27:02,748
<i>They locked Chuck up</i>
<i>at the peak of his career.</i>

1192
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:05,148
<i>He couldn't record a damn thing.</i>

1193
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:07,483
- Goodbye.
- Mr. Berry! Mr. Berry!

1194
01:27:17,298 --> 01:27:20,631
- Yeah?
<i>- Somebody busted up your store.</i>

1195
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:23,127
What? Somebody broke in?

1196
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,763
<i>You better come and see about it.</i>

1197
01:27:25,873 --> 01:27:27,864
Yeah, I'll be right down.

1198
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:30,141
Who is this?

1199
01:27:32,013 --> 01:27:34,140
<i>Len's world was changing.</i>

1200
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:39,186
<i>Not only was Muddy questioning him,</i>
<i>but so were the folks in the neighborhood.</i>

1201
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:43,417
<i>Colored folks who were told</i>
<i>they weren't colored no more, but black,</i>

1202
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:46,593
<i>who was told they had a power.</i>

1203
01:27:46,694 --> 01:27:50,027
<i>They had the right to own</i>
<i>their own businesses.</i>

1204
01:27:50,131 --> 01:27:52,725
<i>And who was this white man</i>
<i>getting rich off of them?</i>

1205
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:54,461
You want to fuck around back here?

1206
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:57,197
<i>The south side of
Chicago was getting mad.</i>

1207
01:27:57,305 --> 01:27:59,239
<i>Everybody could feel
the change coming.</i>

1208
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:01,604
Get on out of our neighborhood!

1209
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:07,907
<i>Screaming fans went nuts again</i>
<i>for rock and roll star Elvis Presley.</i>

1210
01:28:09,484 --> 01:28:13,113
<i>Presley, handsome as ever,</i>
<i>tipped his hat for the cameras.</i>

1211
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:16,190
Well, there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen,

1212
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:18,017
your new king.

1213
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:20,560
I'm about to win this money, baby.

1214
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:23,421
Tough luck, boy.

1215
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:25,260
- Tough luck?
- You lose.

1216
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:27,266
Back up, motherfucker.

1217
01:28:27,902 --> 01:28:30,462
No tough luck got this, motherfucker.

1218
01:28:31,005 --> 01:28:34,702
Because this shit here
says my luck is just fine.

1219
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:36,606
What you gonna do, blow me to death?

1220
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:37,803
Shit.

1221
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:43,317
Walter.

1222
01:28:43,418 --> 01:28:45,477
Okay. Oh, Jesus. Walter!

1223
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:48,849
Oh, God.

1224
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:53,287
You ain't come and get me, Mama.
You didn't come and get me.

1225
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:58,363
I've been waiting for
you for a long time.

1226
01:28:59,367 --> 01:29:00,664
I'm here.

1227
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:02,667
I found you.

1228
01:29:03,504 --> 01:29:06,132
Mama loves you. Come on, stay with me.

1229
01:29:06,641 --> 01:29:09,439
- I just got to rest my eyes.
- Stay with me.

1230
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:12,305
I just got to rest my eyes.

1231
01:29:12,413 --> 01:29:14,210
No. No, stay with me.

1232
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:30,454
Wait a minute.

1233
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:34,634
Wait a minute.

1234
01:29:42,176 --> 01:29:43,803
<i>Last night</i>

1235
01:29:45,313 --> 01:29:48,544
<i>I lost the best friend I ever had</i>

1236
01:29:54,021 --> 01:29:57,115
<i>Now you've gone and left me</i>

1237
01:29:58,292 --> 01:30:01,750
<i>That make me feel so bad</i>

1238
01:30:01,863 --> 01:30:03,660
All right. All right.

1239
01:30:05,032 --> 01:30:06,329
All right.

1240
01:30:08,636 --> 01:30:09,603
All right.

1241
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:15,842
Thank you. Thank you.

1242
01:30:26,454 --> 01:30:27,785
All right.

1243
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:31,748
Well, we'll have to see if we can...

1244
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:36,424
If we can't get him a new suit.

1245
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:45,501
Get him one of them boxes
with the blue satin lining inside.

1246
01:30:47,308 --> 01:30:49,208
Have him look slick.

1247
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:51,278
I got to use the toilet.

1248
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:21,268
- Can I get you some tea?
- No, thank you.

1249
01:31:22,743 --> 01:31:26,179
You know, there's a whole line
of bluesmen on your lawn,

1250
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,407
waiting to see if you're dead.

1251
01:31:28,516 --> 01:31:30,006
Looking to see if they owe me money.

1252
01:31:30,117 --> 01:31:31,175
Yeah.

1253
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:35,581
Look at that. You're the
first man ever gave me flowers.

1254
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:38,818
- Thank you.
- Yeah, well, don't tell nobody.

1255
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:41,827
They're beautiful.
I'll put them in a vase.

1256
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:43,759
You okay?

1257
01:31:43,865 --> 01:31:45,594
I'm good. Thank you.

1258
01:31:46,534 --> 01:31:48,365
- Mud.
- Wolf.

1259
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:52,497
Shit.

1260
01:31:57,311 --> 01:32:00,678
I know Walter was into you for a whole lot,
but he got anything coming his way?

1261
01:32:00,781 --> 01:32:03,978
- You know how he spent his money.
- Yeah, I know it.

1262
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:08,452
Look here.

1263
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:12,816
I got $200 to my name.

1264
01:32:14,829 --> 01:32:17,354
You're gonna have to help pay
for Walter's funeral.

1265
01:32:17,465 --> 01:32:18,489
Who said I wouldn't?

1266
01:32:18,599 --> 01:32:21,762
Why he got to pay for Walter's funeral?
He ain't Walter's daddy.

1267
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:25,066
Is you and me talking? Walter put a lot of
goddamn money in his billfold, that's why.

1268
01:32:25,172 --> 01:32:27,800
- I'm the only motherfucker making money?
- Looks like it.

1269
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:31,037
That's the man's job, make money
off of you. You from Mississippi.

1270
01:32:31,145 --> 01:32:34,478
- You ought to know that.
- How many Caddies did y'all go through?

1271
01:32:34,582 --> 01:32:37,073
Let's get this straight.
I didn't fuck you.

1272
01:32:37,184 --> 01:32:38,811
I didn't say nothing
about who fucked who.

1273
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,548
You insinuated that with your bullshit!

1274
01:32:41,656 --> 01:32:44,124
You was out with the fucking jewelry
and the broads all the time.

1275
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:46,625
And you was a motherfucking saint?

1276
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:52,094
Who here is a saint?

1277
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,128
Who here?

1278
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:56,866
- Settle down.
- No, Revetta, please.

1279
01:32:56,971 --> 01:33:00,771
If you act like a boy, keep asking for
handouts, he gonna treat you like one.

1280
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:03,036
Is you and me talking, motherfucker?
What is you looking for?

1281
01:33:03,144 --> 01:33:06,409
I'm looking to help
bury a fellow musician.

1282
01:33:06,514 --> 01:33:08,379
I said I'll pay for it!

1283
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:15,453
Now, it feels good not to have a daddy.

1284
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:20,215
And as much as I don't like you,
I want you to feel good

1285
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:23,086
like that, too.

1286
01:33:49,523 --> 01:33:51,081
I killed Walter.

1287
01:33:54,028 --> 01:33:56,997
I killed him
when I let you take away his amp.

1288
01:34:00,401 --> 01:34:02,164
I'm the motherfucker?

1289
01:34:05,272 --> 01:34:07,001
I'm the motherfucker?

1290
01:35:08,436 --> 01:35:10,199
<i>It was over,</i>

1291
01:35:10,304 --> 01:35:13,068
<i>the music, Chess Records.</i>

1292
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:15,636
<i>Everybody could feel it.</i>

1293
01:35:16,644 --> 01:35:19,078
<i>Len was getting
out while he could.</i>

1294
01:35:21,682 --> 01:35:24,845
So, working on something
behind my back now, huh?

1295
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:29,819
What happened to <i>"Trust In Me"?</i>

1296
01:35:30,991 --> 01:35:33,152
I know what you've been doing.

1297
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:35,922
- Yeah, what?
- You gonna sell the company.

1298
01:35:43,037 --> 01:35:45,528
You know, back when I started this,

1299
01:35:47,641 --> 01:35:50,576
nobody'd let a black man do
what I got done.

1300
01:35:50,678 --> 01:35:52,373
Doors weren't open.

1301
01:35:55,082 --> 01:35:56,515
Now they are.

1302
01:35:58,018 --> 01:35:59,076
Time to move on.

1303
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:01,154
You gonna be missing out.

1304
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:04,949
You don't think I know that?

1305
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:11,122
So, you mean to tell me, this could be
the last time I sing a song for you?

1306
01:36:18,305 --> 01:36:20,068
Better make it good.

1307
01:36:20,541 --> 01:36:22,509
They don't get no better.

1308
01:36:23,544 --> 01:36:24,943
Y'all ready?

1309
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:49,927
<i>Something told me</i>

1310
01:36:50,037 --> 01:36:53,063
<i>It was over</i>

1311
01:36:55,876 --> 01:36:59,209
<i>When I saw you and her</i>

1312
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:01,281
<i>Talking</i>

1313
01:37:04,084 --> 01:37:06,575
<i>Something deep down</i>

1314
01:37:06,687 --> 01:37:10,555
<i>In my soul said, "Cry, girl"</i>

1315
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:13,149
<i>- Cry, girl</i>
<i>- Cry, girl</i>

1316
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:16,661
<i>When I saw you and that girl</i>

1317
01:37:16,764 --> 01:37:18,994
<i>Walking around</i>

1318
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:26,697
<i>I would rather,
I would rather go blind, boy</i>

1319
01:37:30,377 --> 01:37:35,838
<i>Than to see you walk away from me</i>
<i>Child, no</i>

1320
01:37:38,652 --> 01:37:42,713
<i>So you see, I love you so much</i>

1321
01:37:42,823 --> 01:37:46,384
<i>That I don't want to watch you</i>
<i>leave me, baby</i>

1322
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:50,027
<i>Most of all, I just don't</i>

1323
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:53,622
<i>I just don't want to be free, no</i>

1324
01:37:57,104 --> 01:38:00,403
<i>I was just, I was just</i>

1325
01:38:00,507 --> 01:38:03,305
<i>I was just sitting here thinking</i>

1326
01:38:05,045 --> 01:38:06,478
<i>Of your kiss</i>

1327
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:10,710
<i>And your warm embrace, yeah</i>

1328
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:16,281
<i>When the reflection in a glass</i>

1329
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:20,053
<i>That I held to my lips now, baby</i>

1330
01:38:22,363 --> 01:38:23,990
<i>Revealed these tears</i>

1331
01:38:24,098 --> 01:38:27,499
<i>That are on my face</i>

1332
01:38:31,205 --> 01:38:32,797
<i>And, baby</i>

1333
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:38,368
<i>And, baby, baby,
I'd rather be blind, boy</i>

01:38:39,546 --> 01:38:42,208
<i>Than to see you walk away</i>

1335
01:38:42,316 --> 01:38:45,649
<i>Walk away from me, yeah</i>

<i>And, baby, baby, baby</i>

<i>Chess Records had a hold on Len.</i>

1345
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:48,444
<i>It just wouldn't let him leave.</i>

1346
01:39:49,216 --> 01:39:52,617
<i>He had a heart attack</i>
<i>before he could turn the corner.</i>

1347
01:39:59,226 --> 01:40:01,888
Baby girl, I got some bad news for you.

1348
01:40:03,931 --> 01:40:06,058
Chess ain't leave no will.

1349
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:10,227
That means everything that belonged
to him goes to the wife and children,

1350
01:40:10,337 --> 01:40:12,328
including this here house.

1351
01:40:13,307 --> 01:40:14,865
That's all right.

1352
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:19,111
This morning,
a man came by and gave me this.

1353
01:40:20,447 --> 01:40:22,039
What's that?

1354
01:40:22,149 --> 01:40:24,515
It's the deed to my house.

1355
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:27,712
He said Len wanted me to have it
in case something ever happened.

1356
01:40:27,821 --> 01:40:29,482
That motherfucker.

1357
01:40:30,591 --> 01:40:34,687
He didn't have time to leave a will,
but he had time to think of me?

1358
01:40:37,264 --> 01:40:38,629
He loved me.

1359
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:40,960
That motherfucker.

1360
01:40:49,743 --> 01:40:51,768
What do you say, Willie?

1361
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:53,710
What do you say, there? How you doing?

1362
01:40:53,814 --> 01:40:55,372
I'm here. How you doing?

1363
01:40:55,482 --> 01:40:58,645
Oh, I can't complain. Got some good news.

1364
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:01,050
Remember some of them English boys?

1365
01:41:01,155 --> 01:41:04,022
They didn't forget about us.
Been telling all Europe about us.

1366
01:41:04,124 --> 01:41:06,524
Want us to come over there and play.

1367
01:41:06,627 --> 01:41:08,458
I ain't got no money to get on no plane
to no England.

1368
01:41:08,562 --> 01:41:12,123
You don't need no money.
They're gonna pay for everything.

1369
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:16,896
You're serious?

1370
01:41:17,004 --> 01:41:18,904
We're going to England.

1371
01:41:25,712 --> 01:41:27,441
I'm a little bit...

1372
01:41:28,015 --> 01:41:30,040
A little bit nervous here.

1373
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:33,176
Nervous? What you nervous about?

1374
01:41:33,287 --> 01:41:35,414
You've been performing your whole life.

1375
01:41:35,522 --> 01:41:38,685
Yeah, but not...
Not for these folks over here.

1376
01:41:43,330 --> 01:41:44,524
How am I supposed to know
what they want?

1377
01:41:44,631 --> 01:41:45,893
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

1378
01:41:45,999 --> 01:41:48,661
<i>We are now beginning our descent</i>
<i>into Heathrow Airport.</i>

1379
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:50,100
Here we go.

1380
01:41:57,711 --> 01:42:01,147
Welcome to London.
I hope you enjoy your stay.

1381
01:42:02,683 --> 01:42:04,480
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1382
01:42:15,262 --> 01:42:18,561
- A pleasure to see you, Mr. Waters.
- Mr. Waters!

1383
01:42:25,372 --> 01:42:28,933
They want you, Mr. Waters. They want you.

1384
01:42:29,042 --> 01:42:32,170
<i>We sued Chess Records
for back royalties.</i>

1385
01:42:32,279 --> 01:42:34,110
<i>And we did all right.</i>

1386
01:42:34,214 --> 01:42:36,205
<i>Well, especially me.</i>

1387
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:40,776
<i>Because I wrote all those songs</i>
<i>that Muddy, Walter and Wolf were singing.</i>

1388
01:42:41,488 --> 01:42:43,046
<i>I got paid.</i>

1389
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:45,182
<i>And I'm still getting paid.</i>

1390
01:42:45,292 --> 01:42:48,261
<i>I made enough money</i>
<i>to buy this here studio.</i>

1391
01:42:48,362 --> 01:42:51,297
<i>They were going to tear it down,</i>
<i>but I knew it was history.</i>

1392
01:42:51,398 --> 01:42:54,526
<i>I'm a man</i>
<i>Don't matter if you got the upper hand</i>

1393
01:42:55,669 --> 01:42:59,127
<i>We made the kind of music</i>
<i>that can grow into anything,</i>

1394
01:42:59,239 --> 01:43:02,766
<i>rhythm and blues,
rock and roll, hip hop.</i>

1395
01:43:02,876 --> 01:43:06,573
<i>Whatever you're playing, baby,</i>
<i>we're right there with you.</i>

1396
01:43:08,382 --> 01:43:12,910
<i>Just sprinkle a little blues on it</i>
<i>and it's gonna grow up to be big and bad.</i>

1397
01:43:13,654 --> 01:43:15,884
<i>We the hoochie coochie seed.</i>
