2
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,111
My jewels! I've been robbed!
Someone stole my jewels!

3
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,311
Help! Police!

4
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,878
My diamonds! They've gone! Help!

5
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,597
Monsieur Robie?

6
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,313
Lepic, Mercier. Monsieur Robie,
we represent the Surete.

7
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,308
We are making inquiries in reference
to some jewel robberies.

8
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,753
We believe you could provide us
with information that would be helpful.

9
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,670
Would you be good enough to
accompany us to our office in Nice?

10
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,188
May I put on something more formal?

11
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,511
- OK.
- You left in a hurry?

12
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,756
- They came for me.
- The police?

13
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,997
- Five of them.
- Naturally, you are innocent.

14
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,272
I haven't stolen jewellery
in 15 years.

15
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,835
- Honesty!
- It has a good feeling.

16
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,079
What do you think of my kitchen?
Works like a machine.

17
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,590
Like our little band
in the Underground during the War.

18
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,190
Cutting, slicing, just like the old days.

19
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,631
They think I'm responsible
for these robberies, don't they?

20
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:46,153
- They were in prison with you.
- We're the first to be suspected.

21
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,670
Since the War,
I have obliged them to be honest.

22
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,954
I did not want them to break
their paroles and return to prison.

23
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,152
If my parole is broken,
they'll throw away the key.

24
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,797
I came to tell them and you that
I had nothing to do with the robberies.

25
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,711
Perhaps I believe you, but your
comrades think you let them down.

26
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,038
I wouldn't put it past them
to be doing the robberies themselves.

27
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,151
Simple men without education?

28
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,669
- No, Robie.
- Monsieur Bertani?

29
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,998
Excuse me, business calls. Don't go.

30
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,036
Bonjour, Foussard.

31
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,673
Coincidence can be terrible.

32
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,317
These robberies all bear your mark
but you claim to be innocent.

33
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,636
I do more than claim. I insist!

34
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,548
I can't understand how this thief
can imitate me so perfectly.

35
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,390
It's someone who knew my technique,
maybe somebody in the police.

36
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,437
He picks perfect victims
and the right stones.

37
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,156
Goes up walls, over roofs, leaves
no clue and disappears in the night.

38
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,078
Just like John Robie.

39
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,034
- You don't believe me!
- You're as nervous as a cat.

40
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,915
If somebody caught this imitator,
we'd all be off the hook.

41
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,439
Surely.

42
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,918
The police are chasing the wrong man.
Someone's got to chase the right one.

43
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,908
- One day he'll make a mistake.
- There's only one answer.

44
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,112
I've got to catch
this imitator myself.

45
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,436
You couldn't do more than the police.

46
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,395
But I could, and I'm the only one who
could, because I can anticipate him,

47
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,310
figure out his next move and catch
him with his hand in the jewel case.

48
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,159
Nobody will believe what you say.

49
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,148
Who believes me now?
The biggest problem is time.

50
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,511
I've got to hit him
before he hears I'm after him.

51
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,508
I need better information, the kind
that takes months to dig out.

52
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,757
Like who has jewels to be stolen?

53
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,556
Yeah. Where they live, where they
keep the stones, how much they drink.

54
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,991
Whether they have dogs,
guns, servants, insurance.

55
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,476
For old times' sakes,
perhaps I can help you.

56
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,870
- What have you got?
- You made me remember something.

57
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,116
Two days ago, a man came here.

58
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,197
- I did not like him.
- Why not?

59
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,439
He called me to his table,
asked me about crime and criminals.

60
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,712
Me, a respectable restaurateur!

61
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,959
- Does he know about the robberies?
- He asks me questions.

62
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,314
I refuse to answer. Then he asks me
about the jewels my clients wear.

63
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,230
I say to myself, "You are something
to do with this new cat."

64
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,317
"Maybe you are the new cat."

65
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,988
Foussard's daughter will take you
by boat to the beach club in Cannes.

66
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,395
Wait for a phone call there.

67
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,072
- Mr Cat, let's go.
- Danielle, do me a favour.

68
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,750
- Don't call me a cat.
- I only do one favour a day.

69
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:46,193
- Will you do as your father asks?
- Did I brush your fur the wrong way?

70
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,352
- You're getting us wet.
- It must be true.

71
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,519
- Cats don't like water.
- Don't mention that word again.

72
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,475
- A man should never regret his past.
- I only regret one thing.

73
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,194
That you never asked me to
marry you?

74
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,073
No, that I ever taught you English.

75
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,068
You only taught me the nouns.
I learned the adjectives myself.

76
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,317
- The word cat is a noun.
- Not the way you use it.

77
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,638
For you it means excitement,
danger, affluence.

78
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,277
What do you think of that word,
"affluence"? It means wealth.

79
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,915
- What's on your mind?
- Nothing.

80
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,398
I was thinking about you. Imagining
you in your expensive villa.

81
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,878
Enjoying life, while we work
like idiots for a loaf of bread.

82
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,594
I work too,
raising grapes and flowers.

83
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,633
And rubies and diamonds and pearls.

84
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,918
School's open again.

85
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,398
Professor Robie will conduct a class
on how to get spanked in a hurry.

86
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,355
You can't touch me. I've graduated.
Are you going to South America?

87
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,074
No, just the beach club at Cannes.

88
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,272
I've always dreamed
of going to South America.

89
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,278
People say it's a virgin country.

90
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,313
I can cook, sew,

91
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,798
keep my mouth shut and peddle
stolen jewels on the black market.

92
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,078
You don't think I'm responsible
for all those recent robberies?

93
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,679
I think so.

94
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,350
Yes, together with your father
and my Resistance pals.

95
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,997
There's one great difference.
They are furious with you. I am not.

96
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,637
Listen carefully. I stole once,
a long time ago. I went to jail.

97
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,436
I know. You escaped, joined
the Underground and became heroes.

98
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,872
I wanted to make up for the things
I'd done. I've never stolen since.

99
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,676
I know what you've got.
Pardons that are not worth anything.

100
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,317
They were paroles, and we fought
for six years to earn them,

101
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,397
those of us who were still around.

102
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,114
Those paroles don't have much value.

103
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,312
They haven't been withdrawn
from circulation.

104
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,548
- No South America?
- No, just the beach club at Cannes.

105
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,320
Well, in that case we should hurry.

106
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,990
That airplane probably
belongs to the police.

107
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,358
- What's he doing now?
- He's coming back over us.

108
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,758
- Good. Well, wave to him.
- Suppose he's not my type.

109
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,509
Wave anyway, as if you're
a pretty girl out for a ride.

110
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,233
Well...

111
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,633
Not that pretty!
We want to get rid of him.

112
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,150
- How much further to the club?
- About 15 minutes.

113
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,319
When you get there, pull inshore
and mingle with the other boats.

114
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,078
- And then?
- I'm getting out.

115
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,876
- I'll leave my clothes with you.
- But you hoped to be inconspicuous!

116
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,753
Nobody will recognise me in these.

117
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,074
- Hello?
- The man I speak with you about.

118
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,999
The man who ask about the jewels.

119
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,078
He will wait for you
at the flower market in Nice.

120
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,195
He will find you. I told him you
would be tossing a coin in the air.

121
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,478
Tails?

122
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,475
HH Hughson, Lloyd's of London.

123
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,435
Are you the man who knows who owns
the best jewellery in this vicinity?

124
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,634
- We insure the important pieces.
- Insurance? That's gambling.

125
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,717
Shall we say betting?

126
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,071
Yes, let's say betting.
I have a long shot for you.

127
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,953
A little help in return
for some of your losses.

128
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,789
- So Mr Bertani told me.
- Are you interested?

129
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,278
The proposition sounds intriguing,
albeit a little unorthodox.

130
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,357
Does that mean yes or no?

131
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,437
- My dear Mr Robie...
- Smith.

132
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,835
I beg your pardon. Ever been married?

133
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,318
- No. What has that to do with it?
- It might help you to understand.

134
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,149
I have two wives,
Felicity and the London office.

135
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,237
I must return worthy of both.

136
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,558
I see. They wouldn't approve
of your giving me a list of clients?

137
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,912
Officially, you come under
the category of extremely bad risk.

138
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,354
I'll see you later.

139
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,793
It's a pleasure to meet an insurance
agent who enjoys paying off claims.

140
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,428
- Unofficially, there's hope for you.
- I was sure there would be.

141
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,395
- We're both taking a big chance.
- What happens to you if I'm caught?

142
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,196
- I might be embarrassed or censured.
- They could put me away for good!

143
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,277
You made a bad choice of profession.

144
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,790
Let's come to an understanding.
I'm doing you a favour.

145
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,833
I take the risks,
you get the jewellery back.

146
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,556
Mr Smith, it strikes me that only
an honest man would be so foolish.

147
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,435
- How much do you need?
- Half a dozen names.

148
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,039
Anything else?

149
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,119
Addresses, habits, descriptions
of the stones and settings.

150
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,676
Suppose it gets into the wrong hands?

151
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,839
It already has, unless you're
the thief. Where are you staying?

152
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,439
Carlton, Cannes.

153
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,152
No, my dear fellow,
not in the middle of the day.

154
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,515
Bring it to the table with you.

155
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,999
Come along.

156
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,428
Under the circumstances,
do you think it pays to advertise?

157
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,473
He hasn't left the villa in years.

158
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,233
- How do you like the place?
- Immensely.

159
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,673
It's a kind of heaven, where a man
dreams he'll go when he retires.

160
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,679
About that list of clients
who have jewellery worth stealing.

161
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,795
- Why don't we enjoy our lunch first?
- I don't want to seem impatient.

162
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,710
But I have to come up with something
convincing for the magistrate.

163
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,115
It's a nice custom they have here.

164
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,551
Provisional liberty
based on insufficient evidence.

165
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,637
That may not last long for me.

166
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,914
- You were in the Underground Army.
- I was in the Resistance.

167
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,588
- Did you kill many people?
- 72.

168
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,991
I know what would have pleased you.
Not one of them was insured.

169
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,670
You're a man of obvious good taste
in everything.

170
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,668
- How did you... Why did you...?
- Why did I take up stealing?

171
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,075
To live better, to own things,

172
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,035
to acquire this good taste you enjoy
and which I'm reluctant to give up.

173
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,710
- You were frankly dishonest?
- I tried to be.

174
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,071
I thought you'd have
some tale of hardship,

175
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,068
your mother ran off when
you were young, your father beat you.

176
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,990
No. I was in an American trapeze act
in a circus that travelled in Europe.

177
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,988
It folded, so I put my agility
to a more rewarding purpose.

178
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,077
You have no other defence?

179
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,398
I only stole from people
who wouldn't go hungry. Your plate.

180
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,468
- Quiche Lorraine, you'll enjoy this.
- I've heard of it.

181
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,513
- It looks delicious.
- Yes.

182
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,676
It's wonderful.
The pastry is as light as air.

183
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,509
Germaine has sensitive hands,
an exceedingly light touch.

184
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,119
I can tell.

185
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,950
She strangled a German general once,
without a sound.

186
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,791
Extraordinary woman.

187
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,788
I take it you were
a sort of modern Robin Hood.

188
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,310
You gave away most of the proceeds
of your crime.

189
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:44,311
Kept everything myself. Let's face it,
I was an out-and-out thief.

190
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,034
- Like you.
- I say, steady on.

191
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,028
Wait. Did you ever take an ashtray
from a hotel, or a towel?

192
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,435
Souvenirs, they expect that.

193
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,189
You're given an expense allowance
for your meals, right?

194
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,711
This meal is free. Are you going to
deduct it from your expense account?

195
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,196
- No, it would be stupid. You agree?
- Yes.

196
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,392
You're a thief.
Only an amateur, of course.

197
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,910
But it will help you sympathise
with us professionals.

198
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,714
- I don't understand.
- Look at it this way.

199
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,629
- You're sorry you took the ashtray?
- Right now, yes.

200
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,116
You'll be sorry you didn't deduct
this lunch from your account.

201
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,711
I can't deduct every little item.
I couldn't spare the time!

202
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,956
Some day, you'll wish you had.

203
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,232
If an ashtray is missing,
they don't come for you.

204
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,638
Let a diamond bracelet disappear
and they shout, "Robie, The Cat!"

205
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,754
You don't have to spend every day
proving your honesty. I do.

206
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,439
Let's get down to business. The list.

207
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,116
- Is something bothering you?
- I told the police.

208
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,312
- I didn't expect them to like it.
- They thought it a splendid idea.

209
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,671
They hope you'll provide
the evidence against you.

210
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,792
Ah, yes.
It had to be something like that.

211
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,759
- Suppose it all goes wrong?
- You're wasting time.

212
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,190
Quite a thorough job.
Have some wine, Hughson.

213
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,195
Yes, I think I will.

214
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:44,269
I wish I'd known someone in insurance
when I started in the burglary business.

215
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,319
Let me see, my first bait
will be this Mrs Stevens,

216
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,671
the American with the diamonds
and the daughter.

217
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,635
I'm having dinner with them tomorrow.
I could possibly arrange a meeting.

218
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:04,073
In this business you can't do things
the honest way. Remember that.

219
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:18,631
Wouldn't it be better if you left
that jewellery in the hotel safe?

220
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,277
I didn't buy these things for
my old age. I bought them to wear.

221
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,313
Put your money away. You can cheat
a little on your expense account.

222
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,639
That's France.

223
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,197
Everyone gets a tip, whether
he's earned it or not. It's the law.

224
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,392
Everywhere you go,
you complain about tipping.

225
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,149
And I shall continue to complain.
I've just paid for the privilege.

226
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,870
Let's go to the casino.
I want to hit the tables.

227
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,313
Perhaps I should just mail them the
money. No, Pierre, I can't afford it.

228
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,671
Handsome! I wouldn't mind
buying that for you.

229
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,757
- Mother!
- Come along.

230
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,397
- Mr Hughson may not like gambling.
- Everyone likes to gamble, even you.

231
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,636
I have an intense dislike for it.

232
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,673
When the stakes are right,
you'll gamble.

233
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,957
This is imitation? Really?
You mean, costume jewellery?

234
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,393
The things they make! You can hardly
tell it from the real thing.

235
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,955
Better than anything in Oregon.

236
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,993
- Almost everything is!
- Thank you.

237
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:51,913
Baccarat's my game. Why did you let
me close to this whirling pickpocket?

238
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,398
Ah, wouldn't you know?

239
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,278
I'm terribly sorry, madam.

240
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,595
But, madam, that was
a 10,000 franc plaque.

241
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,555
Maybe she... Madam, if you'd rather
not take my word, it's all right.

242
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,950
Thank you. I'll trust you too.
I won't count it.

243
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,315
If Jeremiah were only here!

244
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,308
This flying around from Palm Springs
to St Moritz to the Riviera,

245
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,397
he'd think it was foolishness.

246
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,910
He used to say, "I wouldn't be
a society gadabout"

247
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,271
"if they promised me
I could live forever."

248
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,156
He got his wish! Mr Burns,
where did you say you were from?

249
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,511
- Oregon.
- Jeremiah would have liked you.

250
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,508
A man with both feet on the ground,
that's what he was.

251
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,679
He never realised the value
of the ground he had his feet on.

252
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,075
- We had a ranch...
- Mother, please.

253
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,353
Mr Burns would be interested.
We had a ranch, not a very big one.

254
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,233
No plumbing. A little thing out back.

255
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,718
Jeremiah will never know how close
he came to 20 million barrels of oil.

256
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,315
Bourbon's the only drink. You can
pour that champagne down the Channel.

257
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,353
Why wait 80 years to drink the stuff?

258
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,189
Great vineyards,
huge barrels ageing forever,

259
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,550
poor monks running around testing it,

260
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,070
so some woman in Oklahoma
can say it tickles her nose!

261
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,953
Mother, we ought to go to bed.

262
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,992
Nobody ever calls me Jessie any more.

263
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,715
Mr Burns, would you call me Jessie?

264
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,593
- I'd be happy to.
- Good.

265
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,476
Mr Hughson, would you call me Jessie?

266
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,557
- If you like.
- I like.

267
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,911
- Mr Burns, you said lumber?
- That's right.

268
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,432
How come you haven't made a pass at
my daughter? Don't say, "Oh, Mother!"

269
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,428
- Mr Burns, I asked you a question.
- Very pretty.

270
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,154
Quietly attractive.

271
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,148
But too nice. Sorry I ever sent her
to that finishing school.

272
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,670
- They finished her there!
- Come on, Mother.

273
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,668
And so to bed, where I can cuddle up
to my jewellery.

274
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,668
You know, Mr Hughson,
as rare and wonderful as they are,

275
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,235
I'd rather have 100,000 Jeremiahs.

276
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,228
- I'll toddle along to my cot.
- I'll escort you to your suite.

277
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:30,117
- Very thoughtful. Come on, Jessie.
- Do you make much money at lumber?

278
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,993
Right now, building is booming.

279
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,192
Would you mind
if I had you investigated?

280
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,755
Not at all. With what object?

281
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,748
If I were Francie's age,
you'd sound too good to be true.

282
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,433
Thank you. You know, there's
very little lumber around here.

283
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,995
Why did you come to the Riviera?

284
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,714
To meet someone as charming as you.

285
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,708
Boy, now I am going to have you
investigated!

286
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,390
- Aren't you going in?
- I'm down the other end.

287
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,310
How much did he get away with?

288
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,910
The gems were insured
for 35,000 in dollars.

289
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,997
Somebody wins, somebody loses.

290
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,637
I sympathise. Pretty rough having to
send bad news back to your office.

291
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,673
I insured Madame Leroux personally.

292
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,158
At least you know that the burglar...
What do they call him?

293
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,998
- The Cat.
- Yes.

294
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,155
He's still around and getting closer
all the time. That's something.

295
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,638
Mrs Stevens, would you keep
your jewellery in the hotel safe?

296
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,799
- Do I wear the safe round my neck?
- Not literally.

297
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,470
Your insurance company goes into
shock every time something's stolen.

298
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,468
If you haven't any guts,
you shouldn't have taken my bet.

299
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,468
- Do you wanna welch?
- If they're stolen, you'll be paid.

300
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,753
But we couldn't replace the affection
you have for those pieces.

301
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,952
I have no more affection
for that jewellery

302
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,879
than I have for a train ticket.

303
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:34,108
They're pretty and make it possible
for my daughter to go to places

304
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,437
and not be ashamed of me,
that is, too ashamed of me.

305
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,789
- Good morning, Mr Hughson.
- Good morning.

306
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,877
- Mr Burns.
- You sent for me.

307
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,153
I thought we might go for a swim or,
if you're not athletic, sunbathing.

308
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,397
I think I can manage to stay afloat.

309
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,717
Mr Hughson's been telling us
about a robbery.

310
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,194
Who?

311
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,518
Madame Leroux, wife of
a high government official. $35,000.

312
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,190
Too bad. You should find
a more happy business.

313
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,597
The famous jewel thief, The Cat,
is loose again.

314
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,756
Mother, you're next.

315
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,837
I'm insured.

316
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,477
- I'll get my bathing trunks.
- I'll be down in a few minutes.

317
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,752
- Good hunting, Hughson.
- Just a minute.

318
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,748
- Weren't we going to...?
- Weren't we going to what?

319
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,111
- Last night we discussed going up.
- Up?

320
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,996
- Up the funicular railway.
- I can't even spell funicular!

321
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,595
What are you doing this afternoon?

322
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,951
A real estate agent
gave me a list of villas for rent.

323
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,390
Do you plan that long a vacation?

324
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,114
I might even retire here.

325
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:50,713
Some of the villas aren't in good
repair. The roofs need examination.

326
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,113
Don't let the robbery spoil your day.
It's only money, and not even yours!

327
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,631
Shall I ask the social director
to introduce us?

328
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,991
No, I was wondering
which was the best way out.

329
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,637
- The Mediterranean's this way.
- I'm a gambler. Let's try that.

330
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,797
There's a message for you.

331
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,199
Thank you.

332
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,430
You performed a beautiful robbery
last night.

333
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,119
Strictly routine.

334
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:17,031
You steal a small fortune and then lie
on the beach with an American beauty.

335
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,754
That's why one needs a small fortune.

336
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,158
- Is this your next victim?
- She's a useful friend.

337
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,155
Your old friends of the Resistance
who work at the restaurant,

338
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,956
they called the police terrible names
when they let you go yesterday.

339
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,948
Would it be bad manners to ask
who tipped off the police?

340
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,879
They never say anything to the flics.

341
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,479
Somebody did.

342
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,468
But they would be happy if you were
caught during your next job.

343
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,035
It's nice to know I have friends.

344
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,789
- Perhaps it would be better.
- Any particular reason?

345
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,597
I heard talk in the kitchen: What
a pity if they must kill The Cat.

346
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,030
They will do all they can to avoid prison.

347
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,313
The police want me in jail.
My old friends want me dead.

348
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,876
- The Cat wants me out of town.
- What do you mean?

349
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,516
He sent me a message.
The sky is about to fall in on me.

350
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:19,158
It's foolish to remain here without
knowing what may happen to you.

351
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,837
If you were in South America with me,
you would know what will happen.

352
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,156
You make it sound dangerous.

353
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,035
It would be so much nicer
to be killed by love, no?

354
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,231
I'll get the water out of my ear.

355
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,592
John, you know what sort of men
they are at Bertani's.

356
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,314
They will do something to you.

357
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,318
Yes. I better get back.

358
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,950
What has she got more than me,
except money?

359
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,993
And you are getting plenty of that.

360
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,829
Danielle, you are just a girl.
She is a woman.

361
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,555
Why do you want to buy an old car
if you can get a new one cheaper?

362
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,228
It will run better and last longer.

363
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,636
My old car just drove off.

364
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:12,836
No, it's turned amphibious. I thought
I'd see what the big attraction was.

365
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,113
- And rate an introduction.
- You didn't tell me your name.

366
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,630
- Danielle Foussard.
- Miss Stevens.

367
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:25,197
How do you do? Mr Burns has told me
so little about you.

368
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,518
- We met a couple of minutes ago.
- That's right, a few minutes.

369
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,508
Only a few minutes ago?
And you talk like old friends!

370
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,439
That's warm, friendly France for you!

371
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:41,509
I was asking about renting some water
skis. Would you like me to teach you?

372
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,190
Thank you, but I was
women's champion last season.

373
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,315
- It was just an idea.
- Were you talking about water skis?

374
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,672
It looked as though you were
conjugating irregular verbs.

375
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,518
- Say something nice, Danielle.
- She looks a lot older up close.

376
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,069
To a mere child,
anything over 20 might seem old.

377
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:13,274
A child? Shall we stand
in shallower water and discuss that?

378
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,878
- Enjoying yourself?
- It's very nice, the sun and all.

379
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,390
It's too much for me.
I'll see you at the hotel.

380
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:29,515
Finish telling me why French women
are more seductive than Americans.

381
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,234
You know what I'd like to tell you!

382
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,993
Here.

383
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,957
Do you have time for me now?

384
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,278
- I'm sorry I was so long out there.
- I thought you'd be a lot longer.

385
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,189
Well, what about cocktails?
Six o'clock suit you?

386
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,595
We can talk about that on the way.

387
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,995
- To where?
- To rent you a villa.

388
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,154
- Picking a villa is personal.
- I have my car.

389
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,999
And lunch with chicken and beer.

390
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,510
It's too much to expect.
A tiring, dusty trip...

391
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,679
You're bound to get lost. A stranger
who doesn't know the language.

392
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,031
I was going to hire
an English-speaking chauffeur.

393
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,117
I'll give you a wholesale rate.

394
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:35,199
- And no tipping.
- Your terms are generous.

395
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,672
- Too generous to refuse.
- My terms usually are.

396
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,235
- Where's your car?
- Right there.

397
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,228
I can't seem to get out of this
gracefully, so let's go.

398
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,311
I've been waiting for you to mention
that kiss I gave you last night.

399
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,990
Back home in Oregon,
we'd call you a headstrong girl.

400
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,478
- Where in Oregon? The Rogue River?
- Where were you born?

401
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,797
In a taxi, halfway between home
and the hospital.

402
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,877
I've lived in 27 different towns.

403
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,594
- Is somebody chasing you?
- Boys.

404
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,870
You can stop running now.

405
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:05,631
When my father died, they discovered
oil on our land. I started to travel.

406
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,991
- The boys' fathers were chasing you?
- Yes.

407
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,510
I had a funny feeling
they wanted my money.

408
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,597
I'm impressed.

409
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,078
Back in Oregon, we'd have called you
a rich, headstrong girl.

410
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,317
- Money handles most people.
- You believe that?

411
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,592
- I've proved it.
- You're a singular girl.

412
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,189
- Is that good or bad?
- Good.

413
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,188
You know what you want,
you go after it. Nothing stops you.

414
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,277
You make it sound corny.

415
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,358
You're a jackpot
of admirable character traits.

416
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,232
I knew that.

417
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,750
You do things with dispatch.
No wasted preliminaries.

418
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,078
Not only did I enjoy that kiss,
I was awed by the efficiency behind it.

419
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,635
I believe in getting down to essentials.

420
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,549
Inviting me for breakfast,
planning a swim and now this drive.

421
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,832
Miss Stevens,
you are a girl in a million.

422
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,430
That's a routine compliment,
but I'll accept it.

423
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,428
- May I ask a personal question?
- I've been hoping you would.

424
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,950
What do you expect to get
out of being nice to me?

425
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,630
- More than you're willing to offer.
- I know.

426
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,675
You're in Europe to buy a husband.

427
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,509
- The man I want doesn't have a price.
- That eliminates me.

428
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,950
You're right. Give me a woman
who knows her own mind.

429
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,357
No one gives you a woman like that.
You have to capture her.

430
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,676
- Any particular method?
- Yes.

431
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,190
But it's no good unless
you discover it yourself.

432
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:59,070
- Are you sure this is the address?
- It's on the estate agent's list.

433
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,633
Let me see.

434
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:04,515
Let's look at the gardens.
No need to bother the people.

435
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,118
Why don't you own a place like this?

436
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,518
Palaces are for royalty. We're just
common people with a bank account.

437
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,836
That sounds like your mother, not you.

438
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,350
We're not that different.
A few years and some grammar.

439
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,915
And jewellery. You never wear any.

440
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,395
I don't like cold things on my skin.

441
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:27,116
- Why not invent some hot diamonds?
- I prefer more tangible excitement.

442
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:32,314
- What do you get a thrill out of most?
- I'm still looking for that one.

443
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,471
We were going to look at the gardens.

444
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:49,073
I was interested in the architecture.
Turn of the century, isn't it?

445
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,117
You never mention your wife.

446
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,108
- I never found time to get married.
- You don't seem pushed for time.

447
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,312
Did you come over to add items
to your diary,

448
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,830
like the name of that French girl
you swam out to meet?

449
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:12,158
- You are husband-hunting after all.
- That wasn't jealousy you heard.

450
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:17,115
Merely disappointment in your limited
imagination. Teenage French girls!

451
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:22,075
I bet you snowed her under, the
handsome lumber man from America.

452
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,272
I'll bet you told her
all your trees were sequoias.

453
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:29,758
That sounds like jealousy to me.
Don't be ashamed of it. Let it out.

454
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,669
- You're somewhat egotistical.
- Fighting fire with fire.

455
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,031
- Miss Stevens?
- Yes, Mr Burns?

456
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,151
- You know what I think?
- About what?

457
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,238
- You.
- I don't really care.

458
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,317
Tell me.

459
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:50,638
You're an insecure, pampered woman,
accustomed to attracting men.

460
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:54,628
You're not sure whether they're
attracted to you or your money.

461
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,154
- You may never know.
- Anything else?

462
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,148
You need something I haven't the time
or inclination to give you.

463
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,191
And what is that?

464
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,756
Two weeks with a good man
at Niagara Falls.

465
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,074
I'm hungry. What about that picnic?

466
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,113
Not till we get to
the picnic grounds.

467
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,790
- Which you've picked out.
- Which I've picked out.

468
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,514
- Is it far?
- A few miles.

469
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,359
- Lonely and secluded?
- Naturally.

470
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,473
Then why are we dawdling like this?

471
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,150
That's exactly what
was running through my mind.

472
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:44,232
- Slow down.
- And let them catch us?

473
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:48,069
- Let who catch us?
- The police who were following you.

474
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,635
Police following me?

475
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:55,277
Yes, police following you,
John Robie, The Cat.

476
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,913
Lovely day! Have you ever seen
any place more beautiful?

477
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,271
Just look at the colours
of the sea and the sky,

478
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,516
and the pink and green buildings.

479
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:31,429
Think of all those roofs
you could climb over.

480
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,154
- Who did you call me?
- John Robie.

481
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:39,115
The jewel thief known as The Cat.
I read about you in the Paris paper.

482
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,356
You may have read about The Cat...

483
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:46,156
I thought you said you were hungry.
The picnic basket's in the trunk.

484
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:59,198
Try to bluff me, and I can have the
fun of telling you how clever I was.

485
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,834
Since I'm not Mr Robie but Mr Burns,

486
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:06,556
there would be hardly any point,
but tell me how clever you were.

487
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:11,197
- The first thing I noticed...
- Don't sound so pleased!

488
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,518
I never caught a jewel thief before.
It's stimulating. It's like...

489
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,756
Like sitting in a hot tub?

490
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:23,518
Let me serve. First time I saw you
was on the beach at Cannes.

491
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:27,508
You swam ashore from a motor boat
driven by that French girl.

492
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,429
- You got an opener? Thank you.
- Do you want a leg or a breast?

493
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,517
You make the choice.

494
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,508
That was two days before
you showed up as Mr Conrad Burns,

495
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,517
just over from America.

496
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,995
- Did you swim?
- Naturally.

497
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,351
Don't be disappointing
and sound like Mr Burns.

498
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,838
- I can only be myself, Miss Stevens.
- Then be yourself, John.

499
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:53,191
- I prefer Conrad.
- You can't be serious.

500
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,949
It's time you called me Francie.

501
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,799
They've tried to steal Mother's
jewellery before.

502
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,994
When I read about the... you in the
paper, a small item, but I picked it up,

503
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,350
I was sure Mother would catch your eye.

504
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,471
She did, because I liked her.

505
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,353
- So far, Miss Stevens...
- Francie.

506
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:16,030
- You haven't said anything clever.
- Stick around.

507
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,391
The next thing I noticed
was something remarkable.

508
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,275
All evening, you looked at my mother,
not at me.

509
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,711
- I kissed you, didn't I?
- I kissed you.

510
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,559
- I wasn't looking at her then.
- You were thinking about her.

511
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,639
- You let me say goodnight so easily.
- I'm a gentleman.

512
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:37,230
A rough lumber man
from the Northwest?

513
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,512
I must remember to yell
"Timber!" occasionally.

514
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:47,073
Here comes the clever part.
You're just not convincing, John.

515
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,431
You're like an American
in an English movie.

516
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,632
You don't talk like
an American tourist.

517
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,991
The guidebooks say,
"Don't behave like a tourist."

518
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,510
You never mention business
or baseball or television

519
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,234
or wage freezes or Senate probes.

520
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,954
The things I left America to forget.

521
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,630
You're not American enough
to carry it off.

522
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:13,628
- Tell me, how long has it been?
- How long has what been?

523
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,150
- Since you were in America.
- Four or five days.

524
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,874
- And Oregon?
- Two days before that.

525
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:23,789
Name three deciduous trees
indigenous to the Northwest.

526
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,470
You're a very nice girl
with too much imagination.

527
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,468
Talk like that and I'll go to jail
for something I didn't do.

528
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,716
Will you rob Mother or somebody else?

529
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,038
- Somebody else!
- That's nice. Mother likes you.

530
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,199
Lady Kenton should be our next job.
Isn't she on your list?

531
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,518
She ought to be. The Kenton jewels
are famous. I know her villa.

532
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,996
- I can hear your next line.
- The Cat has a new kitten.

533
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,033
- When do we start?
- Don't talk like that.

534
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:57,233
- You're leaving fingerprints on me.
- I am not The Cat.

535
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,910
Why are the police following you?
Show me that list.

536
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:05,955
That villa isn't for rent. The Sanfords
own it. I'm going to a party there.

537
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,668
You've a very strong grip.
The kind a burglar needs.

538
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,874
That's why you came up here.

539
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:30,148
We'll have cocktails at 8.00
and dinner at 8.30 in my suite.

540
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,032
We'll talk about it there.

541
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,994
I can't come. I'm going to the casino
and a firework display.

542
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,953
There's a better view from my place.

543
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,196
Already got another date.

544
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,359
Everywhere you go, I'll have
you paged as John Robie, The Cat.

545
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:49,034
8.00 and be on time.

546
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:53,028
- I haven't got a decent watch.
- Steal one.

547
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:00,394
I could not speak with you today, Mr
Robie. I did not know your new name.

548
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,115
What were you doing
at the Sanford villa?

549
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:08,154
I supply food for the grand gala.
I was inspecting the kitchen.

550
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:13,593
I do not ask you what you were
doing there. You prepare also, no?

551
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,190
There will be many women,
rich jewels.

552
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,949
- Just the bait I need.
- Something The Cat can't resist?

553
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:24,470
- I suppose your boys will be there.
- Naturally.

554
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,114
They threatened to put me away.

555
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:31,108
They'd be much too busy
to do anything like that.

556
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,312
- You keep them busy.
- Goodbye, Robie.

557
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,034
Who was the pretty American girl?

558
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:40,073
You bring her to my restaurant
for dinner?

559
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,750
- Not tonight. She made plans for us.
- Soon.

560
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:59,835
If you want to see the fireworks,
it's better with the lights out.

561
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:04,318
You're going to see one of the
Riviera's most fascinating sights.

562
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:08,308
- I was talking about the fireworks.
- I never doubted it.

563
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,990
The way you looked at my necklace,
I didn't know.

564
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,510
You've been dying
to say something about it.

565
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:19,759
- Have I been staring at it?
- You've been trying to avoid it.

566
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,155
May I have a brandy? Care for one?

567
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:28,959
No, thank you. Some nights
a person doesn't need to drink.

568
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:37,838
Aren't you nervous to be in a room
with diamonds, unable to touch them?

569
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,917
No.

570
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:43,510
Like an alcoholic outside a bar
on election day.

571
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,433
- Wouldn't know the feeling.
- All right.

572
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:51,599
You've studied the layout,
worked out your timetable,

573
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:57,193
put on dark clothes with crepe-soled
shoes and a rope, face blackened.

574
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:03,591
Over the roofs, down to the right
apartment... and the window's locked.

575
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:08,112
All that elation turned into frustration.
What would you do?

576
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,311
I'd go home, get some sleep.

577
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:15,711
What would you do? The thrill is
in front of you, but you can't get it.

578
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,390
The gems glistening
on the other side of the window.

579
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:24,230
- Someone asleep, breathing heavily.
- I'd go home, get some sleep.

580
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,158
Wouldn't you use a glass cutter,
your fist, to get what you wanted,

581
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,033
knowing it was there waiting for you?

582
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:35,710
- Forget it.
- Drinking dulls your senses.

583
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,753
And if I'm lucky, some of my hearing.

584
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,078
Blue-white with hairlike touches
of platinum.

585
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:47,319
I have the same interest in jewellery
as in politics, modern poetry,

586
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,353
or women who need
weird excitement: None.

587
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:55,588
Hold this necklace in your hand
and tell me you're not Robie The Cat.

588
01:05:56,080 --> 01:06:01,313
John, you're going to rob that villa
we cased this afternoon, aren't you?

589
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:05,957
I suppose "rob" is archaic.
You'd say "knock over"?

590
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,037
Don't worry. I'm good at secrets.

591
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,949
- Have you been to a psychiatrist?
- Don't change the subject.

592
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:16,358
I know the perfect time. Next week
is the Sanfords' annual gala.

593
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:20,348
Everyone who counts will be there.
I'll get you an invitation.

594
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,437
It's an 18th-century costume affair.

595
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,235
There'll be thousands of dollars'
worth of jewellery.

596
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:30,991
Some guests stay for the weekend.
We'll do it together. What do you say?

597
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,479
My comment would be censorable.

598
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,515
Give up, John. Admit who you are.

599
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,994
I can tell where you're looking.

600
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,957
Look, John. Hold them.

601
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:07,994
Diamonds, the only thing in the world
you can't resist.

602
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:12,432
Then tell me you don't know
what I'm talking about.

603
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:29,193
Ever had a better offer in
your whole life? One with everything?

604
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:36,909
- I've never had a crazier one.
- Just as long as you're satisfied.

605
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:45,077
You know as well as I do
this necklace is imitation.

606
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,157
Well, I'm not.

607
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:26,318
- Give them back to me.
- What did you have in mind?

608
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,795
Give them back. Mother's jewels.

609
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,477
I don't have them.

610
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,711
Wait a minute.

611
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,114
- When did it happen?
- When I was asleep.

612
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:48,278
- Let's look.
- The place to look is here!

613
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,436
Help yourself.

614
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,798
Did Francie tell you what happened?

615
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,434
Yes, she's searching my room.

616
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,599
- She knew where my jewellery was.
- May I look in your room?

617
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:08,316
If it'll do any good. We ought to
call the police and the manager.

618
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,397
Would you let me look first?

619
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,592
I'd be happy
if you didn't find anything.

620
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,677
Why do you say that?

621
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:20,635
I'm tired of draping them over me.
It's exciting to have them stolen.

622
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:23,832
You can't lose, as long as
Hughson makes out the cheque.

623
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:27,828
I'd be crazy to take this attitude
if I did.

624
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:32,955
Why did Francie suspect you, Mr Burns?
A woodcutter from Oregon!

625
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:37,438
I'm anything but that, Mrs Stevens.
My real name is John Robie.

626
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,473
I used to be a jewel thief years ago.

627
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:46,232
- What a wonderful surprise!
- I can't get worked up over it.

628
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:50,035
- Where did you keep the stuff?
- In the case.

629
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:54,948
- Watch out for fingerprints.
- There won't be any.

630
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,795
- Did they get everything?
- Everything.

631
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,315
Francie must have known about you.

632
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:05,717
She guessed today.
You must sleep soundly.

633
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,797
I do.

634
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,710
He came down through the air shaft.

635
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,515
If you're not Mr Burns, why do you
call yourself that and not...

636
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:21,918
- What was the other name?
- John Robie. Mrs Stevens...

637
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:25,908
- The gang won't let you go straight?
- The gang is the law.

638
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:29,032
Mother, don't talk to him.

639
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,435
Don't touch anything to cover any clues.

640
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:35,713
There aren't any clues. He came down
the air shaft and went the same way.

641
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,276
- You know how he got in.
- Did you find anything in my room?

642
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,631
- I certainly did.
- Nothing of your mother's.

643
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,035
You gave those to your accomplice.

644
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:49,836
But the clothes of Mr Burns,
the American, all had French labels.

645
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:54,318
I found this: Everyone on the Riviera
with jewellery worth stealing.

646
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,715
Listen to what it says about us.

647
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:00,037
What good is that?
You're already caught.

648
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:04,677
I called the police and told them
who you are and what you did tonight.

649
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:09,635
Everything? The boys must have
enjoyed that down at headquarters.

650
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,037
He isn't Burns.
He's a jewel thief called The Cat.

651
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,758
What's he doing here now
if he's already got the junk?

652
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:24,034
- Returning to the scene of crime.
- Since when is love a crime?

653
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:28,677
Robie is a real man, not one of
those milksops you take up with.

654
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,713
- Mother, after all.
- After all, my foot.

655
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:37,357
Why do you think we moved so many
times? Your father was a swindler.

656
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:41,838
But a lovable one. This one's
a bigger operator on every level.

657
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,439
Thank you.

658
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:48,714
I've had to travel round after you
to keep men like this away from you.

659
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:52,310
It looks like the blockers
are having all the fun.

660
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,079
She doesn't have common sense, I do.

661
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:00,990
They're my baubles. If I don't care,
why should you? They're insured.

662
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,151
Now, where do we go from here?

663
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,917
To jail.

664
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,515
- Where is he?
- Who?

665
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,393
- John Robie.
- Never heard of him.

666
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,071
Mother, the book you're reading
is upside down.

667
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,799
We may be in France, but a man
is innocent till proved guilty.

668
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,877
- Proved!
- That won't be hard.

669
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,834
John Robie's the first man
who wouldn't roll over for you.

670
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,713
He played us both for fools.

671
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:04,230
You ought to be sent back
to public school.

672
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:08,228
- They could pound sense into you.
- He's a worthless thief.

673
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:12,069
- Just what did he steal from you?
- Mother!

674
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:16,068
Sit down while I tell you something
about life and John Robie.

675
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,475
Sit down before I knock you down.

676
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,990
For three days, you've been fishing?

677
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:46,239
Keep it down. Do you still believe
I did the Stevens job?

678
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,630
Yes, until you sent for me. You'd
hardly risk my bringing the police.

679
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,273
Thank you.

680
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:56,631
You've been in hiding.
Why did you come out?

681
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,832
- I need your help.
- I need yours more.

682
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,917
My superiors at the London office...

683
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:05,590
I might solve some of your problems,
possibly all.

684
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:09,588
- That's too much to hope for.
- I've been watching a villa.

685
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,314
- Which one?
- The South American couple.

686
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:17,753
Somebody else is watching it too, but
I haven't managed to find out who.

687
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,837
- Has he seen you?
- Probably.

688
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:24,477
I want to set a foolproof trap.
I need the assistance of the police.

689
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,557
I can't approach them.

690
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:31,834
- How do you know he'll be there?
- Somebody gave this to Germaine.

691
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,676
It's in French. What does it say?

692
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:40,635
"Stay away from the Silvas' villa.
It's my night to yell, not yours."

693
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,628
- Who gave it to Germaine?
- It was in her shopping basket.

694
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:49,994
Look, convince Lepic to have police
at the villa soon after midnight.

695
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,877
- You're going there?
- Of course.

696
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:57,517
That note is bait for a trap. Someone
wants you to go to the Silvas'.

697
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:00,553
- I know it.
- Possibly to kill you.

698
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,593
- Will you talk to Lepic?
- All right.

699
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,314
But if this Cat doesn't show up,

700
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:10,638
the police might get you and
the thing will turn out rather badly.

701
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,354
I'd better go along as your alibi.

702
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:17,519
I know you get insurance
at a discount but why be foolhardy?

703
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,110
Everyone in Philadelphia
reads "The Bulletin".

704
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,878
Just a minute.

705
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:31,639
- What's all the excitement?
- The cat burglar's dead.

706
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,398
John Robie?

707
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,718
No, a man named Foussard.
A wine steward in a restaurant.

708
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,708
You better start practising
your apologies in two languages.

709
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,474
You're positive Foussard was The Cat?

710
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:50,513
We have no reason
to change the story.

711
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:55,794
- That's hardly a direct answer.
- I cannot give another. Excuse me.

712
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,118
One more point, Lepic.
This is a cheque for $280,000.

713
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,757
That's nearly 92 million francs.
Since you've killed The Cat...

714
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,111
He killed himself
attempting to escape justice.

715
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,790
I've been instructed
to pay off the Stevens claim.

716
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,028
I'm disinclined to do so if recovery
of the jewellery is imminent. Is it?

717
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:20,312
- It will take time.
- Several centuries!

718
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:26,312
I just came in to congratulate you
on your capture.

719
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:34,150
All's well that ends well. The papers
have headlines, tourists can relax.

720
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:37,909
You, Lepic, got your publicity
and a commendation from Paris.

721
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:42,477
Everyone got some good out of it,
except Hughson's company.

722
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:45,990
- But they can afford it.
- It has cut their assets.

723
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:51,439
Poor Foussard. Never guessed
it was him, a wine waiter.

724
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,596
Family man, wooden leg.

725
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:03,078
Didn't you know? Certainly. He lost it
during the War. That's remarkable.

726
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:08,832
A man with a wooden leg climbs up
walls with the agility of a cat.

727
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:12,191
- Is that true?
- I believe he had a bad leg.

728
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,790
You showed good taste
keeping it out of the newspapers.

729
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:20,070
I'll drop into Foussard's funeral,
pay my last respects.

730
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:24,910
Oh, and get a look at the real Cat,
who'll be there purring.

731
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,071
- You know who the real Cat is?
- I do.

732
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:32,590
- Tell the Commissioner.
- He wouldn't believe me.

733
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,951
- Try me.
- You'd find it hard to believe.

734
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:40,358
When I catch The Cat with
a handful of stolen diamonds...

735
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,950
It's because I gave this story
you're at liberty.

736
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:47,835
If I catch you on a roof,
I'll call the reporters again.

737
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:51,794
Lepic, that's all I wanted to know.
Good day.

738
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:45,353
- A most unhappy affair, Robie.
- Because it isn't me down there?

739
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:52,113
Poor Danielle.
I have a great compassion for her.

740
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,477
I'll look out for her.

741
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,433
What happened to the stuff he stole?

742
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:03,599
That's a mystery. The police
have looked in every place.

743
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:09,196
- Some day, it'll turn up.
- The boys owe you many thanks.

744
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,958
- For what?
- You know.

745
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:14,630
For risking prison to capture The Cat.

746
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,717
Oh, that.

747
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:21,198
But you have no reason to complain.

748
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,914
Could you be a little more specific?

749
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,953
The American girl, what's her name?

750
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,634
Francie Stevens, that the one?

751
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,671
What luck.

752
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:39,228
A beautiful woman with love for you,
rich beyond your dreams.

753
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:43,558
- I dream pretty rich.
- When are you going to America?

754
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,637
I didn't know I was.

755
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:50,428
You will make a great mistake
if you don't marry her

756
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,632
and return to your native country.

757
01:21:53,840 --> 01:22:00,188
Let's talk about it at the Sanford gala,
between your catering duties.

758
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:03,073
- You are not invited.
- I will be.

759
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:10,274
- What costume will you wear?
- Something to surprise you.

760
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,159
Good luck.

761
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,150
Killer!
It's because of you he is dead!

762
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:41,838
Get out! Get out of here!
Killer, voleur, murderer!

763
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,799
John?

764
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:16,914
John?

765
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:40,077
- Will you make it hard to apologise?
- Not at all, I'm sure you're sorry.

766
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:45,434
You know I am. I had no idea
of the things you were up against.

767
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,196
What are your plans now?

768
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,960
- Now what?
- That the cat burglar's dead.

769
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:55,755
Foussard isn't The Cat.
The man had a wooden leg.

770
01:23:55,960 --> 01:24:01,318
- Wasn't he trying to rob a villa?
- He was trying to kill... me.

771
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:04,398
- Why?
- I was too close to The Cat.

772
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:08,354
- Who killed him?
- If I find out, I'll let you know.

773
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,313
- Bye, Francie.
- John, why bother?

774
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:17,797
- It's a hobby of mine, the truth.
- Let me do something to help you.

775
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,790
No, thanks. You've made your apology.
Let's go back to mutual disregard.

776
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:29,949
Mr Robie, I was wrong about you,
I think. You might be wrong about me.

777
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,996
Well, I may never know.

778
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,316
- Pardon me...
- I won't pardon you!

779
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,993
I'm in love with you.

780
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:48,872
- That's a ridiculous thing to say.
- Is it?

781
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:54,475
- To you, words are just playthings.
- Were playthings.

782
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:03,195
- I'll make you a sporting offer.
- I don't know if I'm up to it now.

783
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,349
Get me an invitation to the Sanfords.

784
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:11,399
- You can't go without a costume.
- What are you wearing?

785
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:15,070
Louis XV. Mother and I
got them in Paris.

786
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,952
I'll phone you in a day or two.

787
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:22,879
You probably wonder why I want to go.

788
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:24,354
I have an idea.

789
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:29,270
I thought you might like to see
a real burglar in action.

790
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,357
Will it be dangerous?

791
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,394
Not for tourists.

792
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:26,273
We're in! Any man without a lady
on his arm can only be a policeman.

793
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:30,951
- My nerves could stand a drink.
- Your nerves and your mother!

794
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:11,549
There they are, Commissioner Lepic
and one of his men.

795
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,355
Wigs, pantaloons and flat feet.
Come on.

796
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,594
My heart pills! I can't drink
champagne without my pills.

797
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:30,430
- Where do you think you left them?
- In our room. They're in my purse.

798
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:35,395
- Be a sweetie, John, and get them.
- Of course. I'd be delighted.

799
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,114
- Mother!
- All I said was...

800
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,834
Never mind what you said.

801
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,476
Thank you, dear.

802
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:48,597
Shall we dance?

803
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:21,557
Well, I hope the London office
appreciate what I've done for them.

804
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,035
My feet are killing me.

805
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:26,595
Mother was quite an actress.

806
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,519
She played her part well.
Heart pills!

807
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:36,110
I didn't think this scheme of yours
would work, Francie. But it has.

808
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:23,314
I figured it was you the night your father
died. You always did his legwork!

809
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,154
Come down!

810
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:42,435
Come down
or we shall be forced to shoot!

811
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:18,110
- He's not The Cat!
- What does he do on that roof?

812
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,993
- Your job.
- I only believe what I see.

813
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:24,715
- Shoot him and I'II...
- Robie's where I knew he'd be.

814
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,278
He's not alone up there.

815
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:26,919
- Pull me up!
- Don't shout, it makes me nervous.

816
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:29,714
- Then drop me.
- Whatever you say.

817
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,912
You've got a full house.
Begin the performance.

818
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:36,908
- What performance?
- Tell them who is really who.

819
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:38,997
Please, I might slip.

820
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:43,478
- I can hold you for 30 seconds.
- I did it for my father.

821
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:47,389
That's fine, but I already know.
Tell them down there.

822
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:51,275
- I kill you when I get up there.
- Tell them.

823
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:55,552
I was working for my father!
Now, please!

824
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:59,230
- Your father is dead. Who else?
- That's all.

825
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,715
My fingers are beginning to open.

826
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:07,631
Tell them who was behind it. Who knew
as much about me as I knew? Go on!

827
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:13,159
- Bertani's was behind it.
- You're telling them, remember.

828
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:15,874
- Bertani's was behind it!
- That's right.

829
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:18,116
Now, please, I'll die!

830
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,596
- Who brought you here?
- The police.

831
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:53,078
We'd have caught you if my dress
hadn't got caught on the gear shift.

832
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,590
- I only just said goodbye.
- As quickly as you could.

833
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,836
- Didn't I thank you?
- Politely.

834
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:02,032
You left in such a hurry
you almost ran!

835
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:04,117
I had work to do up here.

836
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:08,598
Were you afraid to admit you just
can't do everything by yourself?

837
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:11,155
You needed the help of a good woman.

838
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:14,352
You aren't the Ione wolf
you think you are.

839
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:18,997
Without you I couldn't have done it.
I needed the help of a woman.

840
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:23,948
I guess I'm not the Ione wolf
I thought I was, Francie.

841
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:29,716
Well, I just wanted to hear
you say that. Thank you.

842
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:34,517
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

843
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:52,515
So this is where you live.
Mother will love it up here!

844
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:09,514
