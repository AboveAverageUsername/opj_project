00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,965
Opening day at Wrigley,
and oh, what a sight!

3
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The diamond, the decorations, and the
dread of yet another losing season.

4
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
You were supposed
to fix this thing,

5
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:56,500
will you hurry up? Will
you hustle? Hustle, hustle!

6
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:58,965
Somebody get me a coffee please. What?
- Mr. Murdoch!

7
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,965
I think this is gonna be
THE season for the Cubs.

8
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,500
You think this is gonna be the
season? Why would you think that?

9
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:08,000
We haven't won a pennant since '45
and a series since the... the...

10
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:08,999
1908, I know.
-1908!

11
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,999
I just have this feeling.

12
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,950
You have a feeling. He's got
a feeling! Cancel the coffee!

13
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:15,900
Get me whatever he's drinking!
He's got a feeling about the uh...

14
00:03:15,965 --> 00:03:19,000
We're on the air!
- Eeuh! We're on the air, live! I'm Cliff Murdoch...

15
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
David Pierce will be facing
giant Ledolph great, Clight Kyle!

16
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,000
10 bucks says Kyle
knocks it out of the park.

17
00:03:29,035 --> 00:03:31,035
Alright.

18
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And there's the first
pitch of the season!

19
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Ooh! Kyle got a hold of that pigeon
enough! It's going back! Back!

20
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Ah! Has he got the distance?
It's going! Going! Going!

21
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:52,000
Rowengartner makes
the grab! Unbelievable!

22
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
C'mon, Henry!

23
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,000
Hurry up!
- Watch out!

24
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,000
Wait up guys!
- C'mon, George, you're gonna wreck it!

25
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,999
C'mon, guys!

26
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,534
Good luck today, Henry!

27
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:10,999
Thanks, Mr. Banks!

28
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What's in the baby carriage?

29
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:14,551
A baby!

30
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:15,999
A baby?

31
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Woah!

32
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,000
Hang on, hey! Coming through!

33
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Hey, not so fast!

34
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,999
Where do you think you're going?
- Mom!

35
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,465
Hello George. Hello Clark.

36
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,500
I got a game!
- Yeah, Henry thinks that he's actually gonna play today.

37
00:04:36,535 --> 00:04:38,965
David Rosenthal starts
Hebrew school this week.

38
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Well, it would be great if you got
to play, but honey, if you don't...

39
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:44,499
Yeah?

40
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,250
I'm gonna let you do the
laundry when we get home.

41
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:50,000
You're too kind, mom. Come on!

42
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,999
Have fun!

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Your mom is so cool.
- Yeah, she's alright.

44
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Hey! Wait, wait.

45
00:04:57,535 --> 00:04:59,500
Sunblock!

46
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,999
Nice catch, Henry.

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,965
Yup! You're gonna get
a LOT of playing time.

48
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,650
He's gotta put me in! It's
either me or Windemere!

49
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:18,265
Windemere!
Windemere! Windemere!

50
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,965
What's wrong with him? Are
you a moron? You imbecile.

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Time out, now, time out!
Rowengartner, get in the right field!

52
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Windemere, you
come on in here!

53
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah Henry! Come
on Henry, let's go!

54
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:39,999
Yeah!

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,699
Oh my gosh!

56
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,665
I can't believe they're
letting him play!

57
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,000
Hustle on into the tunnel, and I don't
wanna hear about no asthma neither!

58
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,250
Alright, chuck it in there, baby! Chuck
it! Chuck it in there, baby, come on!

59
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:57,500
Okay, Deezer, let 'er rip! Throw in the
chedder! Come on, right in the kitchen!

60
00:05:57,535 --> 00:06:00,300
Come on! Get in the
big, high, stinky...

61
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:03,000
Would you shut up?

62
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,500
Chuck it in there, baby! Bring it
on, baby! Bring it! Bring it to me,

63
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:09,000
show 'em what you got! Chuck it in there!
He's got nothing! He's got something!

64
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's yours! It's yours!

65
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:14,051
I got it!

66
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:15,499
Go back!

67
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,499
I got it!

68
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,000
Come on!
- You can catch it!

69
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:19,069
I got it!

70
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,965
Oh!

71
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Get it, get it!

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Heh? Huh! Come on!

73
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,300
Huh? Oh!

74
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,000
Turn around! Home! Home!

75
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Is that play legal?

76
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,000
Hey.
- Hey.

77
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,965
How was game?

78
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Well, what does that
mean? Did you get to play?

79
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:03,999
They put me in right field.

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So how'd you do?
- Let's just say I made the play of the day.

81
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,750
That bad, huh?
- I can't even catch a fly ball!

82
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:14,000
So? Maybe you're not cut
out to be an outfielder.

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Maybe you should be a pitcher. Like your father was.
- In my dreams.

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Hey, hey!

85
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,750
Laundry.
- Mom.

86
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:27,000
Mom.

87
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,465
What's this?

88
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,000
The Cubs are bringing in
their right fielder to pitch?

89
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Henry Rowengartner! The entire season
is resting on Rowengartner's shoulders!

90
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:04,965
Bottom nine. Two out.
One on. Full count.

91
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Rowengartner takes a long
look at the runner at second.

92
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,000
Strike one!

93
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Honey, dinner's almost ready.
- You're going out again?

94
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:22,965
Yeah. You gonna be okay?

95
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What's the occasion?
- It's our three week anniversary.

96
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:30,465
Three weeks? congratulations.

97
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Hello? Anyone there? Mary?
- What have you got against Jack?

98
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,301
He's moving too fast!

99
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:36,999
Shh.
- Henry! Hey!

100
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Now the three week anniversary is the,
um... That's the necklace anniversary.

101
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Oh, Jack! Uh...

102
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,500
Oh, Jack, this, uh...
- Let me get that on you.

103
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:54,000
This is too much.

104
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,965
Thank you.

105
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay, uh, honey? In bed by
8:30 and do all your homework.

106
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,000
You're gonna love
this restaurant, Mary.

107
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,000
I think Henry is really starting to like me!
- Um, yeah.

108
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh Mom. That Jack Bradfield.

109
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,000
Hi Clark.
- Hi Edith.

110
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,500
Why don't you talk to Vicky Freiger?
- We have nothing in common!

111
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:13,499
So?

112
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,965
So, what are we
gonna talk about?

113
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,500
Talk about the boat! Her dad
has a boat! We have a boat!

114
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:23,000
We don't have a boat! We have
wood. In the big shape of a boat.

115
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:28,767
Camry Hero told me that Becky Freiger
doesn't think you're very ugly.

116
00:10:28,802 --> 00:10:33,000
Forget it guys! She doesn't like
me! And besides, she's not that hot.

117
00:10:33,035 --> 00:10:37,000
Not that hot? She's that!

118
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Just look at her
sipping that milk.

119
00:10:41,035 --> 00:10:44,000
Milk's done that body good.

120
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Hey look! There's
Becky and Tiffany!

121
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Hi!
- Hey, Rowengartner!

122
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,000
Good game yesterday.

123
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,000
Don't worry about it. I mean,
that kid's a dork anyways.

124
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:10,000
Hey, Rowengartner!

125
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:12,035
Catch!

126
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,750
Radial fractures of the olnum.
Assorted rotator cartilage damage.

127
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:13,000
How long does he have
to be in the cast?

128
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:15,465
August. Minimum.

129
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,250
August? That's like four months.
- Henry has to

130
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:21,000
take it easy. I want those
bones to set correctly.

131
00:12:21,035 --> 00:12:24,000
This is gonna be
a great summer.

132
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,000
Hi Henry! Bye Henry!

133
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hurry!

134
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Come on, let's go! Come on Mom! Come on!
- Alright, okay!

135
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Thank you!
- Wait, wait, come on! Let's go!

136
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The bone is fine. But the tendons
have fused with the humerus.

137
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Is that bad?
- It's unusual. Uh, let's take a look. Okay, let's start with the fingers.

138
00:13:30,035 --> 00:13:33,965
Good, good. Now raise the arm.

139
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,965
Good, good. Now to the side.

140
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,965
Good. Uh, now
bend at the elbow.

141
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Good, good. Now rotate
from the shoulder, slowly.

142
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh!
- Woah!

143
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,965
Oh!
- Funky butt-lovin'!

144
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Did he say "funky
butt-lovin'"?

145
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,465
I'm sorry! I don't know what happened!
- Are-Are you alright?

146
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,750
I, I, uh... I think what's
happened here is that

147
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:09,000
those tendons have
healed, uh, a little tight.

148
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:11,965
I've never seen anything quite like that.
- I'm really sorry.

149
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Go. Please. Just, uh, just go.
- Let's go, come on.

150
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:18,000
Uh, you guys, let's go.
Quickly! Quickly! Come on!

151
00:14:18,035 --> 00:14:19,999
I am so sorry.
- What'd you hit on the nose for?

152
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Hey, uh, I'm gonna wanna
see you on, uh, three weeks.

153
00:14:25,035 --> 00:14:26,034
Right, okay. Thank you!

154
00:14:26,035 --> 00:14:26,999
Nurse?

155
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,965
Come on!
- Here!

156
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What's this? - Happy
cast-off day. - What is it?

157
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:37,000
Cubs tickets!

158
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
We're going to the Cubs game!
We're going to the Cubs game!

159
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,500
Woah, gosh, it's huge!
- Man, look how great it is!

160
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:04,000
Wow, Wrigley Field!
This is great!

161
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,500
You think they'll
pull it out today?

162
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:15,000
Definitely! They got
Steadman on the mount!

163
00:15:15,035 --> 00:15:18,000
Alright!

164
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Come on, Rocket,
throw the heat!

165
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Throw it back! Throw it back! Throw it
back! I don't know, they're saying it!

166
00:15:41,035 --> 00:15:44,000
Bleacher rules - you can't keep a
home run hit by the other team.

167
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:47,000
Throw it back! Throw it back!

168
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,965
I can throw better than that.

169
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,500
Well that's gonna bring
Rocket's earned-run average to

170
00:15:56,501 --> 00:16:00,000
about 300 or so. Which equals
the attendance here today.

171
00:16:00,035 --> 00:16:03,535
What a team.
- Poor Mr. Carson. His last season

172
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:07,035
as team owner. He must
be really depressed.

173
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,500
Bob! Fish! Fish! Look! A
decoder ring! I got it out

174
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:15,000
of the Cracker Jack box! It
fits on your finger like...

175
00:16:17,035 --> 00:16:22,000
Great! Man is turning into a
cracker jack. Okay, Uncle Bob!

176
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,965
Come on, what is this? Get the
game going! What's going on!

177
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,500
Uh, if we don't sell out
every game for the rest of the

178
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:36,000
season, we are going to, uh,
have to forfeit the franchise.

179
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:43,000
Forfeit the franchise? Just when I'm about
to take over the team? No money, no team?

180
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,965
We need a miracle, sir.

181
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Throw him the cheese! Throw
him the high! Stinky! Lipburger!

182
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Rocket! Rocket! Rocket!

183
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Woah!
- Yes! We got it! Yes! Yes!

184
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Throw it back! Throw it back!

185
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,500
Wait a sec! This game
is on cable! Here.

186
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:30,000
Sure, I'll throw it and get
harrassed. Here Henry, you throw it!

187
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:38,000
Okay. Here goes!

188
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh my god.

189
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Safe!
- Did you see that? Woah!

190
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,500
Somebody just threw a frozen
rope from the bleachers

191
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:06,000
to home point! That's
gotta be 435 feet.

192
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:10,965
Durkin! Bring me that arm!

193
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,965
Hey kid! Hey!
- What the hell was that?

194
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Huh? I'm sorry! I didn't mean
it! My tendons! They're too tight!

195
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:22,965
What's your name, kid?
- Henry. - Shut up George!

196
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You trying to show me up, Henry?
- No! Come on guys, let's get out of here!

197
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,965
He'd kill you.
- Thanks.

198
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,500
I just figured out why the Cubs
lose every year. They got more

199
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:40,000
talent in the stand than they
do in the field. Who threw that?

200
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,965
Did you find him? - Oh, no, he left
already. - Well, did you get a name?

201
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,482
Henry. But... but...
nobody in the bleachers...

202
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:50,965
Henry what? How are
we gonna find him?

203
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,500
Sir. This Henry is just a child.
- What do you

204
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:58,000
mean a child, what...
What do you mean a child?

205
00:18:58,035 --> 00:19:03,965
He's a child. He's a short, little,
young person, he's 10-11 years old!

206
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,500
Take this business very seriously!
If you are joking, I swear

207
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:11,000
you're gonna end up selling
weiners! In the nose bleed section!

208
00:19:12,035 --> 00:19:19,035
Not joking, sir. Really, this Henry's just a kid.
- Kid?.. Kid? Excellent. Find him.

209
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Rowengartner checks the runners. And the pitch.
- Hi, honey!

210
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:52,000
Mom, watch this!
- Wait!

211
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Gosh Henry! You could
play for the Cubs!

212
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,500
It's incredible! A real
child with the Cubs?

213
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:06,000
He's gonna be thrilled!
Thank you Mr. Fisher!

214
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,500
I am worried about Henry.
This arm thing is weird!

215
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:15,000
This arm thing is
fantastic! Cheers.

216
00:20:16,035 --> 00:20:20,000
What's with you?
- Nothing.

217
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Hello son. I'm looking for Henry Rule-inverter.
- Henry Rowengarter?

218
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:40,000
Yeah. Is he here?
- I'm Henry.

219
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,965
I must be looking for your father.
- My dad?

220
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Woo! Yoo! Hey, ho! Here we
go, here we go! Sorry I'm late.

221
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Salmart Miller, right? Jack Bradfield.
I am a huge, huge fan. Come here Henry.

222
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:12,000
Henry, this is Salmart Miller,
the manager of the Chicago Cubs.

223
00:21:12,035 --> 00:21:16,000
And this is Henry Rowengartner.
The next Nolan Ryan!

224
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Holy Christmas!
Who is this kid?

225
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,965
Jack. He is a golden goose.
- This kid's incredible!

226
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Just a think of the
possibilities, Jack! A 12 year

227
00:21:36,001 --> 00:21:39,000
old kid playing in the major leagues!
- Yeah, I know.

228
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Wow!
- You are going to be his manager.

229
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And managers, Jack, get 10%.
-10%?

230
00:21:55,035 --> 00:21:56,999
One more.

231
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,000
All we gotta do is get the contract signed.
- Well that's no problem.

232
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,500
Hey kid! How would you like to pitch for the Chicago Cubs?
- Great!

233
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:13,000
But I gotta ask my mom first.
- He's gotta ask his mom first.

234
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,750
Excuse me. Honey,
just keep - ouch! Jack!

235
00:22:21,751 --> 00:22:24,500
You didn't tell me it was
gonna be such a circle!

236
00:22:24,535 --> 00:22:27,250
Oh I didn't know! Stop
worrying, it's just

237
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:29,965
part of the game!
- It's gonna be great, mom!

238
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,500
Mrs. Rowengartner, Larry Fisher,
great news! Great news! I got Pespsi,

239
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:37,000
Kellogg, and Reebok foaming at the mouth for a piece of the kid!
- Which piece?

240
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Henry!

241
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,500
Hey, hey, hey, who are you?
- I'm uh, Jack Bradfield.

242
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:05,000
Henry's manager. What?
Didn't I tell you?

243
00:23:12,035 --> 00:23:18,965
The question is, can you pitch? - Um,
well, my dad used to play! - Semi-pro, pro?

244
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,965
I'm not sure. But he was a pitcher.
- Henry! How about you? Any experience?

245
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,965
Well I play little league for the Fivers, right field.
- Hey look it's Rowengartner!

246
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,500
Carson! Carson! We've all seen
these publicity stunts before.

247
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:35,000
How do we not know Henry is
just here to sell tickets?

248
00:23:35,035 --> 00:23:42,000
I can pitch!
- Oh, you can pitch? Prove it.

249
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Alright. I will.
- Wait, wait, wait. You wanna see him pitch? Come out to Wrigley.

250
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Oh, wow!
- Woah! - Woah!

251
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Come on!
- Hey, wait, wait! Wait!

252
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,965
You ready?
- Can't we just say goodbye here?

253
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
No, I wanna make
sure you get in okay.

254
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:33,000
None of the other Cub
moms are gonna be there.

255
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Okay. You got too big on me.

256
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Bye. Have a great game.
- Hey hej hey. - Okay, okay!

257
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:49,000
I'll see you guys up there.
- See you Mrs. Rowengartner.

258
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Autographs after the game.
- Wait! I'm Henry Rowengartner!

259
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Well, why didn't you say so? Oh, that's
a horse of a different color! Come on in!

260
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,965
Come on in!
- Come on guys!

261
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,500
Can't come in here!
Players only! And the locker

262
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:28,000
rooms are right at the end of the hall.
- Goodbye! Bye!

263
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,965
Hi!

264
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm Henry Rowengartner!
I'm the new pitcher!

265
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Wow! Stan Olkie!

266
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Oh my god, it's Billy Frick!

267
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,500
Ched Steadman?
Unbelievable! Mr. Steadman!

268
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:20,000
Can I have your autograph?
Could you sign it "Rocket?"

269
00:26:24,035 --> 00:26:27,000
I don't do autographs.

270
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Raven-booser. Your
locker's over here.

271
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Brigma.

272
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
That's Phil Brigma. Pitting coach.
I beamed him in the minor leagues

273
00:26:50,001 --> 00:26:53,000
and he's been following me around
ever since. Brigma, this is Henry.

274
00:26:53,035 --> 00:26:57,965
Hi Henry! - Nice to meet you Mr.
Brigma. - Welcome to the big show!

275
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,500
Now, I'll tell you what I want!
You're gonna take a lot of sweat!

276
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:05,000
But eventually, I'm gonna mold you
into one of the greatest 12 year olds

277
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:15,000
that's ever played
this game! Now!

278
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Suit up! I'll
see you out there!

279
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Wow! Look at all these people!
- Sell out! Jack! We're one for one.

280
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,500
Yes, Rocket! Alright!
Come on! Put it right in

281
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:17,000
this kitchen! Yeah! Alright! Do the dew!
- Gosh.

282
00:29:19,035 --> 00:29:24,000
Give him the cheese! The
high! Stinky! Chedder!

283
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You are a bum,
Steadman! Get him out!

284
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Hey!

285
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You're in my seat.
Pitchers over there.

286
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,965
Hey!

287
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,965
Yeah.
- Put the kid in.

288
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,965
The kid?
- Put in what's-his-name, Henry!

289
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,500
Look, he's not ready, Fish!
- I don't care. We got a sell-out

290
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:32,000
crowd and they're not here
to see Chet Steadman. Now!

291
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Rosen-burger. Warm
up. You're going in.

292
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,965
Safe!
- Safe! He's safe!

293
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm sticking a fork in him. He's done. Call in Henry.
- Right.

294
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:12,000
We want Henry! We want Henry!

295
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,965
What's Mr. Brigma doing?

296
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
That's the signal
kid. You're in.

297
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm in? I'm in?

298
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Henry! Henry!

299
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Henry is so cute!

300
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Throw the heat.

301
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Let's go kid! Where's your mom
sitting? This one's for mommy! Mommy!

302
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Honey!

303
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Oh no!

304
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Read em and weep, kid.

305
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Boohoohoo! Boohoohoo! Haha!

306
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,500
Waa! Waa! What, are you
kidding me? I eat fastballs

307
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:15,000
for breakfast! - Get you next
time. - Yeah! That's right!

308
00:34:15,035 --> 00:34:18,017
Oh, he must feel so horrible!
- That's alright.

309
00:34:18,018 --> 00:34:21,000
In Chicago we get used
to this kind of thing.

310
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Sorry!

311
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,965
Ooh! That stings!

312
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Come on! Come on!
- It's okay, honey!

313
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,000
This is a joke.
- Come on, kid!

314
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,500
You gotta take me out. I can't do this!
- That's not

315
00:35:13,501 --> 00:35:17,000
my call, kid. Just rock
and fire! Come on, let's go.

316
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Hey come on, kid,
throw the heat!

317
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You don't have a chance.

318
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Oh no!
- It's a wild pitch, a very wild pitch!

319
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Wight's on his horse!
He's headed for third!

320
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Out!

321
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Richard nails Wight for the final
out and the Cubs go on to win!

322
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,965
Alright Henry!
Way to go Henry!

323
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,500
Rowengartner throws a homer, hits a
man, throws a wild pitch, and still

324
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:11,000
manage to get the save, and the Chicago
Cubs beat the New York Mets 5 to 4.

325
00:36:13,035 --> 00:36:16,965
You're gonna have to teach
him. - Teach him what? - To pitch.

326
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,500
I'm not playing wet
nurse to no 12 year old.

327
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:22,000
You're not playing much
of anything these days.

328
00:36:22,035 --> 00:36:27,965
Brigma is the pitching coach.
- Now! Key to being a big league pitcher is the three R's.

329
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,500
Readiness, recuperation,
conditioning.

330
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:35,000
You see, after the game, a lot
of guys like to ice up their arms.

331
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:39,517
Still other fellas think
that heat is the way to go.

332
00:36:39,518 --> 00:36:43,000
But I discovered
the secret, Henry.

333
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,500
Hot ice. That's right,
hot ice! I heat up

334
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:51,000
the ice cubes! It's
the best of both worlds!

335
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,965
Hi Henry!

336
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,965
Come on, sit here! Come on!

337
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,965
Come on. - I'm not
sitting over there. - Why?

338
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Don't worry about it. It'll
be fine. They're just girls.

339
00:37:16,035 --> 00:37:19,965
Hi!
- Hey.

340
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
How's it going?
- Okay. - Good. Good. Good.

341
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
George, dont. - Hi,
Tiffany. - Hi Roger.

342
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:37,017
How's it going?
- Not bad.

343
00:37:37,052 --> 00:37:39,965
She called you Roger.
- So?

344
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,965
Uh, you having meatloaf?
- Meatloaf?

345
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You hear that Jimmy
Rogers got a pencil

346
00:37:47,001 --> 00:37:49,000
stuck up his nose?
- No, I didn't hear that.

347
00:37:49,035 --> 00:37:51,965
They had to use pliers.
- Ow.

348
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Yeah, the eraser's still up there.
- That's pretty nasty.

349
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
What's that thing
Clark's carrying around?

350
00:38:01,001 --> 00:38:04,000
Oh, it's something for
this boat we're working on.

351
00:38:04,035 --> 00:38:08,000
You have a boat?
- Yeah. Kind of.

352
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
We have a boat but I always
have to ride it with my parents.

353
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Oh.
- Tell her to take it for a ride. Ask her to go for a ride!

354
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,965
Well, see you.
- Bye Roger. - Bye!

355
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Man, you were this close!
- When the boat's done I'll ask her!

356
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Woah!
- You sure your dad said it was alright?

357
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Let's just work on the boat.

358
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Do not crash it please!

359
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yes, okay go get me a screwdriver.
- Okay, which one?

360
00:39:07,035 --> 00:39:10,000
Uh, flathead. That
little one right there!

361
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Hurry!
- Oh man, I'm gonna be late for practice!

362
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Go, go, go, dig
it out, dig it out!

363
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,965
Let me show you how
that's done, alright?

364
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Chin down! Eye on the
ball! Now, bring it to me!

365
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,000
See what I did there? Huh? You see that?
Alright. Now. Give me the good stuff.

366
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Ooh. Third time's a
charm. Let the big dog eat!

367
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
You're gonna be working
with Steadman today.

368
00:40:17,035 --> 00:40:20,000
Hi guys!

369
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
By the way, you're fined $500
for showing up late to practice.

370
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
$500? That's like 6
years of allowance!

371
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Hmm.

372
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
We want Henry! We want Henry!

373
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,965
Garden-hoser!

374
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,965
They're sending Henry in!
- Yeah, we're gonna go sit closer so we can see better.

375
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,500
Come on, let's go get seats.
- The seats? You mean, uh,

376
00:41:12,501 --> 00:41:16,000
down on the P-level? No, no,
no, please. That's too dangerous.

377
00:41:16,035 --> 00:41:18,517
Why?
- Me? The owner of the Cubs sitting down

378
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:21,000
with the fans? They'd kill me.
- You're right.

379
00:41:21,035 --> 00:41:24,000
Oh, don't tell me they're
bringing in- - Henry! Henry!

380
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,500
Well, after a shaky outing
yesterday, 'Mart Mill is

381
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:40,000
showing confidence in the
rookie by bringing him in.

382
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,965
I gotta be out of my mind.

383
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,500
We at Pepsi really think that Henry
could the choice of a new generation!

384
00:41:52,501 --> 00:41:56,000
If Henry can show Pepsi he's
a winner, we'll sign him.

385
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Oof!
- Oh god!

386
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Ow! - Take your
base! - Sorry!

387
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,965
It's okay. - Betcha that
hurt. - Here we go again.

388
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Go talk to him, Chet. Please.
- What do you want me to say?

389
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:22,000
You've been working
with him. Talk to him.

390
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Oh jeez.

391
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Oh man! He gets to talk to Ched Steadman!
- Woah, what a lucky guy!

392
00:42:34,035 --> 00:42:37,000
Don't listen to him,
Hank, he's a loser!

393
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,965
What are you doing out here?
- Well, what am I supposed to do?

394
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Deal from your have-to.
- My-my wh-wh-wh-what? What are you- - The have-to.

395
00:42:46,035 --> 00:42:51,000
Are you speaking English?
- The have-to is what you use when you're afraid.

396
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,965
Okay.
- Okay, you got it? Listen to me.

397
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Everybody is half-win and half-lose. Lose half is afraid.
- Right.

398
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,965
The winning half is fearless.
- Fearless. Right.

399
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,500
The have-to is inside.
It's where the fear lives.

400
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:10,000
Oh, okay. Could you start over again?
- Let's play ball!

401
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
The have-to. Let's see it.

402
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
The have-to. What the
heck was I talking about?

403
00:43:21,001 --> 00:43:24,000
What the heck was
he talking about?

404
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:29,000
So, what'd you tell him?
- You wouldn't understand.

405
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Come on, kid, earn your paycheck!
- Just breathe, baby, come on!

406
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Oh no!

407
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,500
You're out! You're out!
- Yes! You got it!

408
00:43:51,535 --> 00:43:56,000
What a sweet little
double play that was!

409
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Hey! Hey. Way to pitch.
- Huh?

410
00:44:10,035 --> 00:44:13,000
That's two!

411
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,965
Cool!

412
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And believe it or not, Henry's one
out away from back to back saves!

413
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Alright Hank! Cut some cheese,
bud! Cut some big, stinky cheese!

414
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,965
Strike!
- Yeah!

415
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
He throws a strike for the first
time in his professional career!

416
00:44:42,035 --> 00:44:45,965
Hey! Hey!
- Here you go, kid, here you go, here you go!

417
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
You lookin' good,
man, keep lookin' good!

418
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:50,000
Come on now, let's settle
down, let's settle down, son!

419
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,965
Strike two!

420
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Boy that had some heat on it.

421
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Alright, bring him
out of there now!

422
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Henry! Henry!
- Finish him off, Hank, we get the Pepsi contract!

423
00:45:11,035 --> 00:45:16,000
Go, Henry, come on!
- Clean his nose!

424
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,965
Strike three!

425
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Yeah!
- Yes! Yes! Yeah!

426
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,500
Hey! You see that kid?
I never doubted him

427
00:45:45,501 --> 00:45:49,000
for a minute! Hey! Way
to go, Rottle-mocker!

428
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,965
Cha-ching, Jack.

429
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
And with that, Rowengartner
extends the Cubs

430
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:06,000
to their longest winning streak
this season - two.

431
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,965
Hey! Rowengartner! You suck!

432
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Come on down guys! I got outfield!
- I'm batting! - That makes me pitcher!

433
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Think they'll let us play?

434
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,965
Hi. I'm Henry's mom.
- Hi, Henry's mom.

435
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Oh, I'm sorry. It's Mary, I'm
Mary. - Hi Mary, I'm Chet. - I know.

436
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,965
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

437
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Thanks for whatever you
said to him out there.

438
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:02,000
He's a good kid. He must
have a heck of a mom.

439
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Excuse me! Excuse me! Come on!
Don't worry, Mrs. Rowengartner, we'll

440
00:48:22,001 --> 00:48:25,000
take good care of him!
- Do everything Mr. Brigma says, honey, I love you!

441
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:29,000
See you in 10 days! - Bye! - Don't
forget to eat your vegetables!

442
00:48:29,035 --> 00:48:32,965
Get plenty of rest!
- Sunscreen!

443
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,500
Hey! Your mom's got a pretty
good arm! I didn't see the

444
00:48:36,501 --> 00:48:40,000
floater pitch since Scuffy McGee! Bye! So long!
- Bye!

445
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,965
Let's go back to our dull
lives in search for meaning.

446
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,500
Baseball is 162 grueling
games played in a more than a

447
00:48:53,501 --> 00:48:57,000
dozen cities. Now on the
field, we conserve our energy.

448
00:48:59,035 --> 00:49:02,535
On the road, we conserve our food.
- Food?

449
00:49:02,536 --> 00:49:06,035
Everywhere we go, there's free
food. This steak, for example!

450
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,500
Now, I wrap it up in my vomit
bag, I take it back to the

451
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:15,000
hotel, put it on ice, and in
the morning, voila! Breakfast!

452
00:49:20,035 --> 00:49:25,000
Conservation, Henry! Managing
resources! That is the key to baseball!

453
00:49:25,035 --> 00:49:28,000
Brigma!

454
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I'll be right back.

455
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Hey rookie. Come here.

456
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Have a seat. What'd you get?
- Chicken fingers.

457
00:49:45,035 --> 00:49:47,965
How are they?
- Good. How about you?

458
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
One of the best Salisbury steaks I've ever had in my life. You want some?
- Sure.

459
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Thanks for signing
that baseball.

460
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:59,965
Do me a favor.
Don't call me Rocket.

461
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,965
Why?
- Because I'm not the Rocket anymore

462
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,965
Yeah I don't get it, you're throwing so slow.
- Well, thank you very much.

463
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,500
No, no, no, I mean, didn't
surgery fix your shoulder?

464
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:15,000
I don't know what my shoulder
will do if I heat it up again.

465
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
This is your room Mr. Rowengartner.
- We get our own rooms?

466
00:50:31,035 --> 00:50:33,965
Yep!
- This is great!

467
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Well, if you need anything,
I'll be right next door. Okay?

468
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Sorry, your door seems
to be malfunctioning.

469
00:50:44,001 --> 00:50:47,000
I'll get housekeeping up here.
- Thank you!

470
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,965
Nice guy.

471
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,500
The bus leaves at 11:00 sharp.
-11:00, I'll be there.

472
00:50:55,535 --> 00:51:00,000
Punctuality, Henry. Without
it, time stands still.

473
00:51:00,035 --> 00:51:03,000
Alright!

474
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:11,000
You found out where she lives? Well, did
she say anything about me? No, really.

475
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I mean, I gotta go. Bye.

476
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Henry? Henry.

477
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Oh boy.

478
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,965
Little help. Little help now.

479
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,500
September in Chevaz Ravine, Los
Angeles, California. Our beloved Cubbies

480
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:57,000
are just three games behind the New
York Mets, with 15 games left to play.

481
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Yes!

482
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Billy, how's your hand? - It
stinks. - Did you hear that?

483
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:13,000
You made his hand stink.
You were throwing...

484
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Hey big guy, you good for another inning?
- You betcha, Sallie-baby.

485
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:23,000
Good, you're on deck. - Huh?
- You're up after Fern. - Huh.

486
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,965
You can't let him bat.
- He's gotta learn sometime.

487
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,500
Sweet meat pies,
Rowengartner's going to bat.

488
00:52:31,501 --> 00:52:34,000
Oh, I hope that little
feller knows what he's doing.

489
00:52:34,035 --> 00:52:39,000
Stay low.
- Yeah, and? - And don't get killed.

490
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:48,000
You're on. Oh, just take
one bat, one bat. Stay low.

491
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
He's throwing BB's today, man.

492
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Show em what you got, kid.

493
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
They're gonna let him bat?

494
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,965
Put it in my wheelhouse.

495
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,965
Come on, give me
something I can hit.

496
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Just step in the box,
son. Step up to the plate.

497
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Oh my god, oh my god. - Oh my god,
oh my god. - Oh my god, oh my god.

498
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,965
Ahh!
- Ball!

499
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
You almost killed him, you
stupid mother- - of God in heaven!

500
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Hey, brush me back!
- Just cool it!

501
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,965
Play ball.

502
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Oh my god, oh my god. - Oh my god,
oh my god. - Oh my god, oh my god.

503
00:54:18,035 --> 00:54:20,965
Ahh!
- Ball!

504
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,965
He's got no strike zone!

505
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,965
You big, ugly
piece of- - sit!

506
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Hang in there, hang in there Henry!
- Come on, Henry, you're alright!

507
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
No!

508
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,965
Ball! 3-0!

509
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Call strikes! Who cares
how short he is. Let's go.

510
00:54:42,035 --> 00:54:45,000
Powder it, Hank!
- Keep your eyes open, stay low!

511
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,965
All four! Take your base!

512
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Take my base? - Come on, he
swung at the ball! - Alright!

513
00:54:59,035 --> 00:55:02,965
Woah!
- Alright, there you go!

514
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,500
Hank took a rip at that
one, but the ump had

515
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:08,000
already made the call, and
he's on his way to first.

516
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Alright, alright, I'll buy that.
- He got on base! Oh my god, he got on base.

517
00:55:15,035 --> 00:55:19,000
Is this gonna
take much longer?

518
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,965
Let's go, Suarez.

519
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Hey, pitcher! Pitcher,
pitcher, pitcher!

520
00:55:32,035 --> 00:55:33,999
What are you doing?

521
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Hey pitcher! You got something
hanging out of your nose!

522
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,965
Safe!
- He hit him too hard!

523
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
He was just trying to make the tag!
- Hey.

524
00:55:48,035 --> 00:55:51,000
Can't get me.
- Safe. - Can't get me.

525
00:55:51,035 --> 00:55:57,000
Hey, kid.
- Safe. - Close!

526
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Pitcher, pitcher, pitcher!
Pitcher's got a big butt!

527
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Go!

528
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Rowengartner going for second!
- Go, go!

529
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Slide, slide!

530
00:56:29,035 --> 00:56:31,965
Safe!

531
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Yeah!
- Yes!

532
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Pitcher! Nanny, nanny,
nanny! You can't get me!

533
00:56:42,035 --> 00:56:44,965
This game is making me crazy!

534
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Hey, we want a pitcher, not an underwear snitcher!
- Get back!

535
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Hey!
- Kringo Rynell hit Suarez in the back!

536
00:56:58,035 --> 00:57:01,000
That one's for you kid.

537
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,965
Easy kid.

538
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Nanny, nanny, nanny.

539
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Woah.

540
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Andele! Andele!
- Oh.

541
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
They're running! - Run, run,
run! - Faster, faster, faster!

542
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Move it! Move it!
- This is as fast as I go!

543
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Safe! Safe!
- Yeah!

544
00:57:38,035 --> 00:57:40,965
Alright!
- Woah!

545
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:48,000
This kid can do it all!
- Yeah! Woo! Yes! - Yes! Yes!

546
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,482
Chet! Is this your one opportunity
to go? How's it going to go now?

547
00:58:55,483 --> 00:58:57,965
Hey, we're the
Cubs. You never know.

548
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
How does it feel to be
out-pitched by a 12 year old?

549
00:59:00,001 --> 00:59:02,000
I don't care who out-pitches
me, so long as we get the ring.

550
00:59:02,035 --> 00:59:05,000
Henry? Henry!
- Mom!

551
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Coming through! Coming
through! Hot coffee! Hot coffee!

552
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,965
Just drop me off at the next terminal. I'll get a cab.
- No way. We'll take you home.

553
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
That's okay.
- No, no, really, I mean we have this whole huge limosine

554
00:59:52,001 --> 00:59:55,000
that Mr. Fisher gave us. I'm sure
the driver will give you a ride home.

555
00:59:55,035 --> 00:59:59,000
Well, thanks. Thanks a lot.

556
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,965
Hey, hey, how
about a cocktail?

557
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,965
Oh, please. - Alright.
Club soda? - Please.

558
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Alright. How about you?
- Where'd you learn to do this?

559
01:00:16,035 --> 01:00:20,017
DeBrobe, babe. How about you?

560
01:00:20,052 --> 01:00:24,000
Clube soda, babe.
- Okay.

561
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Thank you.
- Thank you.

562
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Love is lovelier the
second time around.

563
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Henry, what are you doing?
- Nothing! I happen to like this music.

564
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
He's turning into a regular social giant.
- Uh-huh.

565
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,965
Where'd she go?
- Nothing like a little pennant-fever to get the juices going!

566
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,500
Mr. Carson sure can throw a party!
- Welcome to life

567
01:01:16,501 --> 01:01:20,000
in the fast lane, Henry!
It's a road less traveled!

568
01:01:21,035 --> 01:01:24,517
Sometimes, you just
gotta put the petal to the

569
01:01:24,518 --> 01:01:28,000
metal and just... live
the fantasy! Rock and roll!

570
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,500
Oh, he's a pretty good student.
He could pay more attention to his

571
01:01:35,501 --> 01:01:39,000
homework, that's for sure.
- Is there anything he doesn't do well?

572
01:01:41,035 --> 01:01:45,000
He doesn't slow dance. Ow!

573
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,500
Makes two of us.
- No. No, no, you're good.

574
01:01:49,501 --> 01:01:53,000
You know, maybe if you
just let go a little.

575
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Like this?

576
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Yeah.

577
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,500
Let me show you how to
enjoy all the lights and

578
01:02:08,501 --> 01:02:12,000
the bells and the whistles.
And remember now...

579
01:02:12,035 --> 01:02:15,000
it's all free.

580
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Shall we?

581
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Excuse me ladies.

582
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,965
Excuse me. Thank you.

583
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Alright now! Let 'er rip, now!
- Oh boy, pinball!

584
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,500
How you doin, Jack?

585
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,965
Can you believe this?

586
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Little bit of
competition, huh?

587
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:10,000
I've been talking to the
Yankees. They wanna buy the kid.

588
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:17,965
For $25 million dollars.
- Buy him? - Buy him!

589
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,500
He's a kid.
- The Cubs own him. And as his manager,

590
01:03:21,501 --> 01:03:25,000
you get 10%, which translations
into $2.5 million dollars.

591
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:40,000
If you can get Mary
to sign the contract.

592
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,500
You'll be in New York
living like a king.

593
01:03:44,501 --> 01:03:48,000
And I think this could be a
very good time to relocate.

594
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I'll do it.

595
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
But you gotta do something for me.
- Name it.

596
01:04:04,035 --> 01:04:07,000
You gotta get rid
of Ched Steadman.

597
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,500
Where is he?
- He'll be here. - He thinks he's so cool.

598
01:04:23,501 --> 01:04:26,000
He should be
working on the boat.

599
01:04:26,035 --> 01:04:31,000
George.
- Why do you always defend him? - What, all I said was the word "George"!

600
01:04:31,035 --> 01:04:34,000
Forget it.

601
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,965
From the top, everybody.
And more smoke!

602
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
You know when it's right. You
know when you feel it, baby.

603
01:04:45,035 --> 01:04:50,000
You hold it. You hear it.
You taste it, yes right.

604
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
You got the right
one, baby. Yeah.

605
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
You could be irresistably, super
hypothetically- - Cut it! Cut it!

606
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
I'm sorry, what was
that last line again?

607
01:05:07,001 --> 01:05:10,000
If it's irresistably, hypothetically,
and logically- - Henry. Henry.

608
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,000
This is unbelievable.
- Hey, I uh, need you to sign something.

609
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,000
What is this?
- This is, uh, Henry's contract.

610
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
What do you think of New York?
- What?

611
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I need you to be more sexy.

612
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
How much longer
is this gonna take?

613
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Hey! Hey.

614
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,500
Well look who finally decided to show up.
- George!

615
01:06:07,501 --> 01:06:10,000
They kept me there for hours.
You think I liked doing that?

616
01:06:10,035 --> 01:06:15,000
I don't know. Do you?
- Look, I'm sorry. Let's just work on the boat and forget it.

617
01:06:15,035 --> 01:06:18,965
Okay.
- No! I'm not gonna work on the boat just because you say to.

618
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,500
What, I'm supposed to
work on it by myself?

619
01:06:21,501 --> 01:06:24,000
Great idea! Work on it
yourself, Mr. Superstar!

620
01:06:24,035 --> 01:06:26,517
What?
- The only reason you're playing for

621
01:06:26,518 --> 01:06:29,000
the Cubs is because you
broke your stupid arm!

622
01:06:29,035 --> 01:06:31,965
Guys! Come on!
- Shut up! - Make me!

623
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Come on, stop, you guys are friends!
- Come on!

624
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I hate you!

625
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
That's gonna make you stupid.

626
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,965
I guess it already did.

627
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Steadman.
- Yeah? - Get in here.

628
01:07:13,035 --> 01:07:16,000
Ooh. Maybe I'll
get my big bonus.

629
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Inside.
- Oh boy.

630
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Sit down, Chet.
- No thanks.

631
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:44,000
The franchise is tired of waiting for your
arm to come around. Isn't that true, Sal?

632
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,500
So, you're gonna sit out
the rest of the season

633
01:07:50,501 --> 01:07:54,000
on the bench, and then
we're releasing you.

634
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Get dressed, I'm
taking you home.

635
01:08:06,035 --> 01:08:09,000
Come on! Now!

636
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
What's the matter?
- Henry.

637
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,500
Don't take this game too
seriously. Because one

638
01:08:28,501 --> 01:08:32,000
day it's gonna be over.
Your gift will be gone.

639
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Don't forget that.

640
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,965
Oh no, I promise we'll be
there. Thank you. Thanks.

641
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I had a limo for you waiting for
you at the stadium to take you

642
01:09:02,001 --> 01:09:05,000
to the photoshoot. Now where were you?
- Ched gave me a ride home.

643
01:09:05,035 --> 01:09:07,965
Ched Steadman? I am so sick
of hearing about Ched Steadman.

644
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Take it easy.
- You take it easy! Now you got 15 minutes to get there. Go get ready.

645
01:09:14,035 --> 01:09:16,965
I'm not going.
- You're not going? You are going.

646
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I'm going to play with my friends.
- You can't just blow off

647
01:09:20,001 --> 01:09:23,000
a photo shoot to go out and play.
- Get out of my face, Jack!

648
01:09:23,035 --> 01:09:27,965
Don't you walk away from me when I'm
talking to you! You show me some respect!

649
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,482
You're not my father!
- That's right, I'm not

650
01:09:30,483 --> 01:09:32,965
your father! Ched
Steadman's not your father!

651
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,500
In fact, your mother
probably doesn't know who your

652
01:09:35,501 --> 01:09:38,000
father is! Your father's
some guy who left town!

653
01:09:38,035 --> 01:09:40,965
That is enough!

654
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Mary! I thought you were in the shower.
- How could you say that?

655
01:09:44,035 --> 01:09:48,965
Mary.
- Get out of my house. I never want to see you again.

656
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Well you're gonna be seeing
me, you're gonna be seeing

657
01:09:51,001 --> 01:09:53,000
a lot of me! Because we're
moving to New York together!

658
01:09:53,035 --> 01:09:56,000
What?
- Henry's been sold to the Yankees!

659
01:09:56,035 --> 01:09:57,999
He sold me?
- You can't do that!

660
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Of course I can! I'm the manager! I make the decisions!
- He is my son!

661
01:10:03,035 --> 01:10:06,965
He's my client!
- What? You are nuts.

662
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I brought in Reebok! I brought in Pepsi!
- Stay away from him.

663
01:10:12,035 --> 01:10:15,000
He's half mine!

664
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Alright, mom!

665
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Don't forget your purse!
- That didn't even hurt, okay?

666
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,500
Oh my god!
- My god, that felt really good! What a bile he turned out to be!

667
01:10:33,501 --> 01:10:37,000
Maybe I should have killed him.
Alright, sit down, sit down.

668
01:10:41,965 --> 01:10:48,965
What he said about your father...
- Yeah?

669
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,965
When I was a teenager...
- Mom. I know about dad.

670
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,000
What?
- I know that he left you when you were pregnant with me.

671
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,000
How did you know that?
- Grandma told me when I was in second grade.

672
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Why didn't you tell me?
- Because I thought you liked telling me stories about him.

673
01:11:26,035 --> 01:11:29,000
About how he was a great
baseball player and all.

674
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Henry, I'm sorry. I just wanted you
to have someone you could look up to.

675
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I do.

676
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Hey.

677
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,000
So, you coming?
- Yeah!

678
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Hey.
- Hi.

679
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Mom. There's something
we gotta talk about.

680
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,965
You know we could actually
win the division today?

681
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
That's great, Uncle Bob.
- The Rowengartners are here.

682
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Henry. You should be suiting up.
- Well, Henry has something

683
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:36,000
he'd like to
talk to you about.

684
01:14:36,035 --> 01:14:41,965
Oh? - I'm not gonna be
back next season. - What?

685
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,500
Why? I mean, you were the best
thing to happen to baseball

686
01:14:45,501 --> 01:14:49,000
since Cracker Jacks.
- No, I love the Cubs. And I lovebaseball.

687
01:14:51,035 --> 01:14:54,000
But there's other
things I wanna do first.

688
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,500
I respect that. Oh, Henry, we sure
are gonna miss you around here.

689
01:14:58,501 --> 01:15:02,000
Yeah, it's been great. There's
just one thing I don't understand.

690
01:15:05,035 --> 01:15:08,965
What's that?
- Why'd you want to sell me to the Yankees?

691
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:15,000
What? Sell you to the Yankees?
- Yeah, I heard that Mr. Fish wanted to sell me...

692
01:15:15,035 --> 01:15:18,000
Oh, uh... No, that was just
spec, Uncle Bob. Nothing final.

693
01:15:18,035 --> 01:15:20,965
You better get out there Henry.
- Yes, sir.

694
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I'm going down to the field level and watch you win us the division.
- Yes sir!

695
01:15:26,035 --> 01:15:29,000
Soon as I take care
of a little business.

696
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Chet. You gonna win it for me today?
- What?

697
01:15:46,035 --> 01:15:49,000
You're starting.

698
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,965
What do you mean,
I'm starting?

699
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Big game like this, I gotta go
with experience. Even if it is you.

700
01:16:02,035 --> 01:16:06,517
Sal.
- Hey guys. Chet's got the ball.

701
01:16:06,552 --> 01:16:11,000
Are you ready? Let's go now!
- Sal!

702
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Hey, you're starting!
- Yeah. I'm shaking like a rookie.

703
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,500
Don't worry about it.
It's just the biggest

704
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:31,000
game in your life.
- I know. - Come on.

705
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Hey! Forgot my lucky seeds.

706
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Oh boy.

707
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:05,000
This is it folks. This is what it's all
about. One game. There is no tomorrow.

708
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,500
For the whole shootin' match.
This is for all the marbles.

709
01:17:17,501 --> 01:17:21,000
The division champions.
The loser goes home a loser.

710
01:17:24,035 --> 01:17:27,965
The winner moves on
to the World Series.

711
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
I can't believe it. I've
been waiting for my whole life

712
01:17:31,001 --> 01:17:34,000
to say those words. 'Cause
I've said the words before but

713
01:17:34,035 --> 01:17:38,000
never like, "World Series!" and I'm
on the air, and we'll be right back.

714
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,500
Listen up! Alright now.
This is the big one.

715
01:17:45,501 --> 01:17:49,000
Chet's on the hill. Back
him up. Play hard. Let's go.

716
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Strike!
- Yes! Alright!

717
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Strike!
- Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes.

718
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Keep it up, big guy.

719
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Strike.

720
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Three strikes.
That's three strikes.

721
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Alright. Yeah!

722
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,500
Steadman's heating it
up like the days of yore,

723
01:19:23,501 --> 01:19:27,000
when men were men, and when...
and that's another story!

724
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
And Mullen slashes one to the left! That's gonna bring around two runs!
- Yeah!

725
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,965
Four hot dogs, please. - Alright, sir,
coming right up for you. - Thank you.

726
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,500
What, are you kidding,
Mac? You're 11 bucks short.

727
01:20:11,501 --> 01:20:15,000
They're 3 bucks a piece.
-3 dollars for a hot dog?

728
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
You're out!

729
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
C'mon, strike me out, okay?
- Watch this. Here I go.

730
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Alright. Come on, Rocket!

731
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Steadman's a little bit of
trouble with a runner on second.

732
01:20:42,035 --> 01:20:45,000
Alright, get him
up, get him up.

733
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,965
Come on, come on.

734
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Goodman gets a standup double! It cuts
the coupling to one! Two to one, Cubs!

735
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:25,965
Hot dogs. Get your
hot dogs. Get em hot.

736
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Steadman is really
laboring. One run is in.

737
01:21:29,001 --> 01:21:32,000
And after the wild pitch Goodman
is on third with two away.

738
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
All four! Take your base!

739
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Chet! I'm gonna take you out!

740
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:04,000
One more.
- No! - Give me one more.

741
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Look. One more.

742
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Rocket! Rocket!

743
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
You're out!
- He's out at home!

744
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Steadman makes a game-saving out!
Keeping the Cubs ahead by one!

745
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Stick a fork in me, I'm done.
- You gave me 6 great innings.

746
01:24:16,001 --> 01:24:19,000
I'm saving you
for the playoffs.

747
01:24:19,035 --> 01:24:24,000
No. I mean I'm done.
I belt the arm go.

748
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,965
You'll let me finish the season
before you take my job, won't you?

749
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Hey! Oh, you're the greatest, Rocket!
- Rowengartner, you're going in.

750
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,965
What'd he call me?

751
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Henry! Henry!

752
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Strike! You're out!

753
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Strike!

754
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Good pitcher!
- You think so? - I know so!

755
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Let's play some ball!
Let's play some ball! Man!

756
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
With two outs, Oakie steps in,
hoping to bring in the runner.

757
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Oh! What a lucky stab.

758
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
The Cubbies are one inning away
from the division championship,

759
01:26:30,001 --> 01:26:33,000
completing the most improbable
season in baseball history!

760
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,000
You're on. One more
inning! One inning Henry!

761
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Oh, kid, please! Get us through
this inning, and I'll never

762
01:26:42,001 --> 01:26:45,000
ask you for anything else
for as long as I live!

763
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Okay. But this is the last time.
- Thank you. Thank you.

764
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
It appears nothing can
stop Rowengartner now.

765
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Just one more! And be careful!

766
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Get up kid!
- Are you okay?

767
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:42,000
I'm okay.
- Alright. - I'm okay.

768
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
This kid is making me crazy.

769
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Alright, Henry, let's warm up.

770
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
What was that? You alright?

771
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I'm fine. Fine.

772
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:26,659
Oh no.

773
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:28,660
Play ball.

774
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Henry! Henry!

775
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Ball? - What the hell
is he doing? - What?

776
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Uh... well, not his
best start, ball one.

777
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Come on, Henry. Quit playing around!
- There's another ball.

778
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Zoom it in there
Henry! Zoom it!

779
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000
I have no idea.
- Henry, throw the ball, hard.

780
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Ball.

781
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Rulinbruter! Come on!

782
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,000
What do you want to do now?
- Ball four. Take your base.

783
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
What's that kid doing out there?
- I don't know Cliff.

784
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Come here. Come here.
Bring it in. Get in here.

785
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Listen, my arm, it's gone.
- What? - No, listen, I can't do hard anymore.

786
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
What are we gonna do?
- I have a plan.

787
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
1, 2, 3, Cubs!

788
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,000
The meeting's over,
and here we go!

789
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Gotcha.
- You're out!

790
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:18,000
The hidden ball trick!
- Alright! - Excited.

791
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I can't believe
he fell for that.

792
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Throw the heat! Throw the heat!
- Cut the funky cheese!

793
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Richard's calling for the
attention of Wock! Again!

794
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,500
I'm gonna kill him!
- Sal! Sal! No, no, let it go! Get over here!

795
01:31:43,501 --> 01:31:47,000
Just have faith! Let it go!
- He's playing stickball!

796
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Ball three.
- I'm gonna kill him. - Easy Chet, let him go, let him go.

797
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Take your base.

798
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Why did he walk him?
- He could have struck him out.

799
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
I'm not going for the hidden ball trick either.
- I don't have the ball.

800
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Oops. - What are you doing
kid? - I dare you to run.

801
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
What? What are
you talking about?

802
01:32:30,035 --> 01:32:33,000
I double dare you.

803
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Hey, cut it out, let's play some ball here.
- What's the matter? Chicken?

804
01:32:40,035 --> 01:32:43,000
Hey, I'm not
chicken, cut it out.

805
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,500
Stop it. Just stop it. Just stop it.
- You should

806
01:32:55,501 --> 01:32:59,000
have run. Gee, I guess
you really are chicken.

807
01:32:59,035 --> 01:33:01,000
I'm not a chicken,
you're the chicken.

808
01:33:01,001 --> 01:33:02,965
No, you're a chicken.
- No, you're the chicken.

809
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,982
Chicken, chicken, - No,
you are the chicken.

810
01:33:04,983 --> 01:33:06,965
You're the biggest
chicken I ever seen.

811
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
You throw the ball real
high. I dare you. See how

812
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:13,000
chicken you are.
- Alright, but it's the last time.

813
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Go, go, go.

814
01:33:28,035 --> 01:33:31,000
You're out!

815
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,965
He got him, he
got him! Two away!

816
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Alright Rowengartner, you do
it! You do it! Anything goes!

817
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,965
Remember me, kid?
- Oh my god.

818
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Holy goosebumps. Not Hado.
- It's Hado.

819
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I'm your worst nightmare.

820
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Throw the heat! Burn it in there. Burn his hand off!
- Fastball.

821
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
You can't hit him
with your fastball.

822
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,965
Strike!

823
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,500
Change-up. That's a
change-up! It's a strike!

824
01:34:42,501 --> 01:34:45,000
Henry totally fooled him
with a change-up!

825
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,000
That's it kid? What, are you
kidding me? Come on, give me it.

826
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
See ya!

827
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Go foul, go foul. - Stay
fair, stay fair. - Foul. - Fair.

828
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Foul ball.

829
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
You were wrong again, Ernie.

830
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Hey kid. You got nothing.
I know it. And you know it.

831
01:35:40,035 --> 01:35:43,000
You're mine.

832
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Oh god. What do I do?

833
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,965
Yeah.

834
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Mom? It was you?

835
01:36:35,035 --> 01:36:38,000
It was me.

836
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Float it.

837
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Henry. One more.
- Show em how, Henry.

838
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Well, this is it, folks.
Everything is riding on this pitch.

839
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:18,000
What are you smiling at, kid?
- Nothing.

840
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
You're out!
- Yes!

841
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Henry! I love you!

842
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,000
We won a division!
We won a division!

843
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Yes, baby! Yes! I love you.

844
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
I got it!

845
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Yeah! Big Hank!

846
01:39:19,305 --> 01:40:19,679
