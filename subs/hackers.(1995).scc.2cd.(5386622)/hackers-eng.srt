3
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,504
- Upstairs!
- What's going on?

4
00:01:04,643 --> 00:01:05,687
Who are you?

5
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:09,795
Dade! Dade!

6
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:11,847
Knock it down.

7
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:16,163
The defendant, Dade Murphy,

8
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:20,093
who calls himself 'Zero Cool',

9
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:25,106
has repeatedly committed criminal acts
of a malicious nature.

10
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:29,666
This defendant possesses
a superior intelligence,

11
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:34,259
which he uses to a destructive
and antisocial end.

12
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:43,829
His computer virus crashed 1 507 systems,
including Wall Street trading systems,

13
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:49,014
single-handedly causing a seven-point
drop in the New York stock market.

14
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:54,478
Dade Murphy, I hereby fine
your family $45,000.

15
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:59,871
I sentence you to probation.
You are forbidden to use a computer

16
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:04,153
or a touchtone telephone until
the day of your 18th birthday.

17
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:38,354
- Dade?
- Yeah, Mom?

18
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:40,129
What are you doing?

19
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:44,653
Taking over a TV network.

20
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,386
Finish up, honey. Go to sleep.
And happy birthday.

21
00:04:56,658 --> 00:04:58,225
Security, Norm...

22
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,303
Norman speaking.

23
00:04:59,443 --> 00:05:02,610
Norman. This is Mr Eddie Vedder
from Accounting.

24
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:06,752
I had a power surge here at home
that wiped out a file I was working on.

25
00:05:07,693 --> 00:05:10,615
I'm in big trouble.
You know anything about computers?

26
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:13,329
Gee...

27
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:18,132
My BLT drive on my computer
just went AWOL,

28
00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:22,586
and I have this big project
due tomorrow for Mr Kawasaki.

29
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:24,919
If I screw up, he'll make me
commit hari-kari.

30
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:30,136
You know these Japanese
management techniques.

31
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:33,651
Could you read me
the number on the modem?

32
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:38,072
It's a little boxy thing
with switches on it.

33
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:40,160
It lets my computer
talk to the one there.

34
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:41,134
212...

35
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:45,832
555 4240.

36
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:14,194
So-called American lndians, Latinos,
and blacks are genetically mediocre.

37
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:16,108
Yak, yak, yak.

38
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:18,302
Get a job.

39
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,842
You are about to experience
the awe and mystery

40
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,443
which reaches from
the inner mind

41
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,923
to... The Outer Limits.

42
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:12,660
Zero...

43
00:07:14,122 --> 00:07:14,991
No, wait.

44
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:28,285
Unbelievable.

45
00:07:28,494 --> 00:07:29,991
A hacker.

46
00:07:36,568 --> 00:07:40,048
Yeah, okay, Acid Burn. That's enough.

47
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:28,351
Shit on me!

48
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:37,330
Good morning.
Did you unpack your stuff yet?

49
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,192
Up all night again?

50
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:44,429
Can this wait until both
of my eyes are open?

51
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:51,286
Can I cut the electricity to his room
so he'll get some sleep?

52
00:08:51,425 --> 00:08:55,114
He's been playing with his computer
all night for a week.

53
00:08:55,914 --> 00:08:57,898
Yes, he could be playing with himself.

54
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:01,935
Yes, I'll ask. Dade,

55
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,510
you like girls, don't you?

56
00:09:04,615 --> 00:09:07,642
Yeah. I just haven't found one
as charming as you.

57
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:11,504
You haven't done anything stupid, right?

58
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,114
Right, Dade?

59
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:15,402
Right, Mom.

60
00:09:15,785 --> 00:09:17,455
And I'm still a virgin.

61
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,691
You hooked it up to the phone,
didn't you?

62
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:39,170
Dade, turn the shower off!

63
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:44,739
You screw up again
and you won't get into college.

64
00:09:57,616 --> 00:10:00,052
I'm sorry we had to move
in your senior year.

65
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:03,985
I didn't want to sell the house
but I had to take this job. You know that.

66
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,055
You'll love New York.
It's the city that never sleeps.

67
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,467
I miss you, too, baby.
Claro que si.

68
00:10:50,686 --> 00:10:52,182
Excuse me.

69
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,584
Chill, man. I'm talking to Venezuela.

70
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:57,089
I'm sorry. Where's the principal's office?

71
00:10:57,229 --> 00:10:58,620
I can't help you, kid.

72
00:11:13,203 --> 00:11:14,630
Do you have your transfer forms?

73
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:19,676
It's a straightforward question.

74
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,018
Do you speak English?

75
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:29,593
Sorry, you wanted...

76
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:31,229
Transfer forms.

77
00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:42,260
Are you coming?

78
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,618
The gym is through there
and the cafeteria is through there.

79
00:11:59,174 --> 00:12:01,228
Great. Cool.

80
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:06,238
What's your name?

81
00:12:06,446 --> 00:12:08,639
Kate. Kate Libby.

82
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,901
Here's your class.

83
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,999
My class.
I'm not in your class?

84
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:16,644
No, you're not in my class.

85
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,447
Give me time.

86
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:23,151
- You new?
- Yeah.

87
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,447
Tell him about the pool, Kate.

88
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,640
Pool?

89
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:31,365
There's an Olympic-size
swimming pool on the roof.

90
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,975
Take the stairs over there.

91
00:12:35,018 --> 00:12:37,385
Yeah. Sure.

92
00:12:39,438 --> 00:12:40,795
Thanks.

93
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,851
Hey! Hold the door!

94
00:12:52,036 --> 00:12:53,115
No pool.

95
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:29,620
Oh, my God. He found the pool.

96
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:35,501
I'm Mr Simpson.

97
00:13:35,641 --> 00:13:39,678
I'm subbing for Ms Bayless,
who was arrested at the anti-fur rally.

98
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:48,203
I know some ofyou kids got computers
at home, but these are school property.

99
00:13:54,364 --> 00:13:58,193
Chapter One.
'Designing Graphical lnterface'.

100
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:07,066
What's your interest in Kate Libby?

101
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:09,120
Academic, purely sexual?

102
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:10,964
Homicidal.

103
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:14,550
What's up, man? I'm the Phreak.

104
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:18,273
The Fantom Phreak?
The King of Nynex?

105
00:14:20,535 --> 00:14:22,273
I know you play the game.

106
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:25,058
Phreak, Phreak, Phreak.
Dude, dude, dude.

107
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:28,851
Joey! One more 'dude'
and I'll slap the shit out of you.

108
00:14:29,547 --> 00:14:33,653
You gotta stop letting your mama
dress you, man. You're hopeless!

109
00:14:35,324 --> 00:14:37,691
- Check it.
- I need a handle.

110
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,796
I don't have an identity
until I have a handle.

111
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:45,173
You're right about that.
Check it. Friday.

112
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:52,273
Wait. How about The Master of Disaster?

113
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:54,605
You're utterly hopeless, man.

114
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:57,145
Ultra Laser... Doctor Doom!

115
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:16,599
Tell me what you need. Records?
Tapes? Any kind offormat or disk.

116
00:15:16,738 --> 00:15:20,357
Check this out, each of you.
Compilation tapes of my own making.

117
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:22,479
I call this 'The Greatest Zukes Album',

118
00:15:22,618 --> 00:15:28,047
featuring Hendrix, Joplin,
Mama Cass, Belushi,

119
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:32,432
all great artists who asphyxiated
on their own vomit!

120
00:15:33,302 --> 00:15:35,112
You can't get this in stores!

121
00:15:45,969 --> 00:15:48,823
Please deposit $5
for the first minute.

122
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,025
Thank you.

123
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:53,557
No, thank you.

124
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:26,512
That's a nice score for a girl.

125
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:30,966
Think you can do better?

126
00:16:32,497 --> 00:16:34,134
I'll give it a shot.

127
00:16:49,063 --> 00:16:51,117
Is this kid bothering you, Kate?

128
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:53,971
Could I get some room here?

129
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,616
Why don't you come up here?

130
00:17:35,174 --> 00:17:36,252
He's good!

131
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:49,409
Well, it looks like I'm on top.

132
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,891
Congratulations.
No-one's ever beat her before.

133
00:17:57,134 --> 00:17:59,012
You just made an enemy for life.

134
00:18:01,657 --> 00:18:03,989
Boy meets world. Let's go.

135
00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:25,217
- Who's that?
- Curtis.

136
00:18:26,784 --> 00:18:27,930
What's he do?

137
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,924
You're looking at it.
He looks slick all day.

138
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:34,543
Joey!

139
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:15,923
What's up?

140
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:25,214
Oh, my God! You...?

141
00:19:37,115 --> 00:19:38,750
Way cool!

142
00:19:40,421 --> 00:19:41,812
You saw that?

143
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:43,622
What the hell is going on?

144
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,955
Pool on the roof must be leaking.

145
00:19:56,046 --> 00:19:58,100
Oh, man. This is going to be good.

146
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:08,507
'God gave men brains larger than dogs

147
00:20:08,646 --> 00:20:11,604
so they wouldn't hump women's legs
at cocktail parties'.

148
00:20:12,231 --> 00:20:13,171
Ruth Libby.

149
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:18,667
I'm not sure your mother qualifies
as a significant 20th century author.

150
00:20:18,771 --> 00:20:21,451
Her last book sold 2 million copies.

151
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:30,534
'Angelheaded hipsters burning for
the ancient heavenly connection

152
00:20:30,673 --> 00:20:34,502
'to the starry dynamo
in the machinery of the night'.

153
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:35,755
Ginsberg.

154
00:20:37,668 --> 00:20:39,303
Nice. Very nice.

155
00:20:41,183 --> 00:20:43,238
He's not in this class.

156
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,908
I said give me time.

157
00:20:46,231 --> 00:20:49,084
He's not enrolled in this class.

158
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:51,311
Well, he's on my list.

159
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:08,641
'Of all the things I've lost,
I miss my mind the most'.

160
00:21:08,886 --> 00:21:10,487
Ozzy Osbourne.

161
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:13,236
You. What is your name?

162
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,914
Emmanuel Goldstein, sir.

163
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:19,812
You, however, are not on my list.

164
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,362
This isn't wood shop class?

165
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:30,948
Class crashing. Come on.

166
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:32,479
Now get out.

167
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:35,993
Thank you, sir.

168
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:44,312
How was school?

169
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:49,811
- What did we learn in school today?
- Revenge.

170
00:21:49,951 --> 00:21:52,631
Ahh. Did we meet someone special?

171
00:21:53,048 --> 00:21:54,614
No. No-one special.

172
00:21:56,422 --> 00:22:00,562
I have to get back to work.
Would you please try to fill these out?

173
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:02,582
Don't worry,

174
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,670
it's only the rest of your life.

175
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,925
Anything else?
Want me to mow the lawn?

176
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:12,606
Oops, I forgot. New York, no grass.

177
00:22:13,476 --> 00:22:14,660
And unpack.

178
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:42,359
You can sit at home
and do absolutely nothing

179
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:45,560
and your name goes through
17 computers a day.

180
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,937
'1984'? Yeah, right. That's a typo.

181
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:54,226
Orwell's here and living large.
We have no names, man. No names!

182
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,523
Can I score a fry?

183
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:59,447
Meet Cereal Killer.

184
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,083
As in Fruit Loops.

185
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:03,032
But he does know things.

186
00:23:03,205 --> 00:23:05,050
Anyway, guys, listen.

187
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:07,939
I'm in this computer, right?
I'm looking around...

188
00:23:08,043 --> 00:23:10,063
You got those Crayola books?

189
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:12,045
Yeah, technicolour rainbow.

190
00:23:13,681 --> 00:23:14,479
Green one.

191
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:16,672
What is that? Let me see?

192
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:20,048
- What are these?
- International UNIX environments.

193
00:23:20,187 --> 00:23:21,858
Luscious orange.

194
00:23:21,997 --> 00:23:25,476
Computer security criteria...
DOD standards.

195
00:23:26,903 --> 00:23:29,444
The pink-shirt book... guide to IBM PCs.

196
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:32,925
So-called due to the nasty pink shirt
the guy wears on the cover.

197
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:34,838
Devil book, the UNIX bible.

198
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:37,518
- What's that?
- Dragon book, compiler design.

199
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,382
- What's that?
- The Red book.

200
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,888
NSA-trusted networks.

201
00:23:44,062 --> 00:23:48,063
Otherwise known as 'The Ugly Red Book
That Won't Fit On A Shelf'.

202
00:23:48,203 --> 00:23:52,517
Anyway, guys. Come on.
I'm in this computer, right.

203
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:58,050
I'm looking around, throwing commands.
I don't know what it does or anything.

204
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,373
It's choice.

205
00:23:59,477 --> 00:24:03,410
It's beautiful. Four hours
just messing around in there.

206
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:06,403
Finally, I figure out...

207
00:24:06,577 --> 00:24:08,213
that it's a bank.

208
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:12,842
Okay, wait. It's a bank. So, this morning,
I check the paper,

209
00:24:12,982 --> 00:24:18,548
some cash machine in, like, Bumsville,
ldaho, spits out $700 into the street.

210
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,393
- That's kinda cool.
- That was me.

211
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:23,523
- I did that.
- You did this from your house?

212
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:26,657
Are you stoned or stupid?

213
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:30,763
You don't hack a bank from your house!
You get nailed by the FBl.

214
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,295
Are your brains in your ass?

215
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:33,895
Don't you know anything?

216
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:36,644
It's universally stupid, man.

217
00:24:36,783 --> 00:24:40,299
I don't know things because you guys
won't tell me anything. Right?

218
00:24:40,404 --> 00:24:42,318
What are the three most used passwords?

219
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:46,180
'Love', 'Secret' and 'Sex'.

220
00:24:46,286 --> 00:24:49,070
But not in that order, necessarily. Right?

221
00:24:49,174 --> 00:24:54,080
Don't forget 'God'. System operators
love to use 'God'. Male ego.

222
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:59,264
To be elite, you have to do a righteous
hack, not this accidental shit.

223
00:25:00,344 --> 00:25:04,137
Which means you score
one of those Gibsons, man.

224
00:25:04,276 --> 00:25:08,348
Those supercomputers they use
to do physics and look for oil.

225
00:25:08,488 --> 00:25:11,029
No way, man. Security is too tight.

226
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:14,125
Maybe. But if I wanted to hack
some heavy metal,

227
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:17,849
I'd work my way in
through some back door.

228
00:25:18,093 --> 00:25:23,312
Oh, man. Wouldn't you just love
to get one of those Gibsons?

229
00:25:24,217 --> 00:25:26,062
Who ate all of my fries?

230
00:25:27,698 --> 00:25:30,517
- Joey!
- No, I didn't touch your fries.

231
00:25:31,351 --> 00:25:34,273
- Cereal, man. You owe me a pack.
- It was him.

232
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:37,127
- Lay off that shit, man.
- I'm gonna hit you!

233
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:41,754
Yes! Home run, home run. Okay, okay.

234
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:45,095
You and me, Lucy.

235
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,705
We're gonna show them, baby.

236
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,096
Ow!

237
00:27:20,832 --> 00:27:21,389
Mr Belford?

238
00:27:21,668 --> 00:27:24,940
My name is The Plague.

239
00:27:25,114 --> 00:27:28,561
Mr The Plague, something weird
is happening on the net.

240
00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:31,344
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?

241
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:34,824
One of the Gibsons is working really hard.

242
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:38,513
We got one person on-line
but with the workload of 10 users.

243
00:27:38,652 --> 00:27:40,045
I think we got a hacker.

244
00:27:45,056 --> 00:27:48,013
Okay, we need proof that we were here.

245
00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:53,755
Yeah. Garbage. Give me Garbage.

246
00:28:05,414 --> 00:28:07,085
Shit.

247
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,203
Never fear,

248
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:37,744
I is here.

249
00:28:38,892 --> 00:28:43,973
- I located the activity to terminal 23.
- Let's echo 23, see what's up.

250
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,488
God wouldn't be up this late.

251
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,380
Shit!

252
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,939
Get me the switching control centre.
I need to trace this call.

253
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:31,475
Hold on, Mom. Hold on one second.

254
00:29:32,415 --> 00:29:35,512
- Open the door, Joseph.
- Yeah, okay.

255
00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:38,507
There you go.

256
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,908
Bed. Sleep.

257
00:29:42,578 --> 00:29:43,587
Now!

258
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:46,822
Sweet dreams, Joseph.

259
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:51,869
He's gone.

260
00:29:52,008 --> 00:29:53,504
Did you get a trace?

261
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,140
Yeah, we got him.

262
00:29:55,523 --> 00:29:56,671
Good.

263
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:12,818
Nice place, huh?

264
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:19,325
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn?

265
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:23,050
- You know who he is?
- No. Don't know who he is.

266
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,164
Do you?

267
00:30:26,601 --> 00:30:29,454
Nikon! Lord Nikon, this is...

268
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:30,949
Crash Override.

269
00:30:31,054 --> 00:30:33,420
Never heard of you.
You done anything?

270
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,326
No.

271
00:30:36,484 --> 00:30:37,807
Come on!

272
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:43,340
What? Your Mom buy you
a 'puter for Christmas?

273
00:30:45,358 --> 00:30:48,455
- Does he know anything?
- Sure. He's elite.

274
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:51,064
Come in.

275
00:30:56,981 --> 00:31:00,809
- Nikon, can I crash at your place tonight?
- Again?

276
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,384
Yeah, sure.

277
00:31:08,151 --> 00:31:10,275
Hackers penetrate and ravage

278
00:31:10,414 --> 00:31:13,998
public and private computer systems,
infecting them with viruses...

279
00:31:14,102 --> 00:31:15,738
Who are these guys?

280
00:31:16,817 --> 00:31:20,611
Richard Gill.
Hacker enemy number one. Real boner.

281
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,952
Showtime. Showtime!

282
00:31:28,092 --> 00:31:29,902
- What's going on?
- Four,

283
00:31:30,006 --> 00:31:33,173
three, two, one...

284
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:36,688
Welcome to our show!

285
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:37,767
Hack the Planet!

286
00:31:37,907 --> 00:31:40,099
Hack the Planet!

287
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,309
For late night hacks, Jolt Cola,
soft drink ofthe elite hacker.

288
00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:46,816
- Who are these guys?
- That's Razor and Blade.

289
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:48,833
Razor and Blade?

290
00:31:48,937 --> 00:31:51,409
That's right. This is a pay-phone.

291
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,289
Don't ask.

292
00:31:53,742 --> 00:31:57,117
As you can see, this isjust a simple
micro-cassette recorder.

293
00:31:57,257 --> 00:32:00,876
Hook it up to the phone,
and drop in five bucks in quarters.

294
00:32:01,015 --> 00:32:04,425
Record the tone the coins make,
hang up, get your money back.

295
00:32:04,565 --> 00:32:07,974
Never again pay for a service
that would be cheap,

296
00:32:08,112 --> 00:32:10,445
if it weren't run
by profiteering gluttons.

297
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:14,133
Remember, hacking is more than
just a crime. It's a survival trait.

298
00:32:16,813 --> 00:32:18,657
I'm a real wild child,
I'm a wild one

299
00:32:20,502 --> 00:32:21,581
I'm a wild one

300
00:32:23,495 --> 00:32:27,149
Thank you! Thank you very much!

301
00:32:30,141 --> 00:32:32,369
Joey! Joey! Thank you!

302
00:32:32,926 --> 00:32:33,797
Freeze!

303
00:32:33,936 --> 00:32:35,224
- What?
- Get out of there!

304
00:32:35,363 --> 00:32:36,164
Out!

305
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:39,260
- Joey!
- Get in there!

306
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,280
Sit down!

307
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,844
Lucy!

308
00:32:43,854 --> 00:32:45,177
Where are you taking her?

309
00:32:46,707 --> 00:32:47,717
Joey!

310
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,923
- How's it going, Ray?
- Looks good, sir.

311
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:00,872
We got an uncorrupted hard drive.

312
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,960
In English, please.

313
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:05,048
I didn't protect the President
for ten years

314
00:33:05,188 --> 00:33:07,100
to finish my career
feeling like an idiot.

315
00:33:07,205 --> 00:33:11,206
I'm sorry, sir. He didn't have time
to erase his computer files.

316
00:33:11,346 --> 00:33:15,207
Good. Let's finish up here.
Take him in for interrogation.

317
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,574
Agent Gill, can you spare a moment?

318
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,803
Why, of course, Jennifer.

319
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:23,910
- Joey!
- How dangerous are hackers?

320
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:30,034
Hackers penetrate and ravage public
and private computer systems,

321
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:33,863
infecting them with viruses
and stealing sensitive materials.

322
00:33:34,002 --> 00:33:35,707
These people are terrorists.

323
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:54,498
Morning, gentlemen.

324
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:56,030
Please, be seated.

325
00:33:56,795 --> 00:33:59,789
I see we're still dressing
in the dark, Eugene.

326
00:34:00,137 --> 00:34:03,758
Once again, don't call me Eugene.

327
00:34:03,897 --> 00:34:05,391
Our recent intruder

328
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:10,890
penetrated using a superuser account,
giving him access to our whole system.

329
00:34:12,108 --> 00:34:14,509
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.

330
00:34:15,205 --> 00:34:19,521
Someone didn't bother reading my memo
on commonly used passwords.

331
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:23,593
As I meticulously pointed out,
the foremost used passwords are...

332
00:34:23,732 --> 00:34:28,708
'Love', 'Sex', 'Secret' and 'God'.

333
00:34:28,846 --> 00:34:32,675
So would Your Holiness
care to change her password?

334
00:34:33,858 --> 00:34:36,712
A hacker planted the virus.

335
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:38,905
Virus?

336
00:34:41,898 --> 00:34:46,734
Yesterday, the ballast program
for a supertanker training model

337
00:34:46,873 --> 00:34:50,912
mistakenly thought the vessel was empty
and flooded its tanks.

338
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:52,722
Excuse me?

339
00:34:53,487 --> 00:34:56,376
The little boat flipped over.

340
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,387
A virus planted within the Gibson system
claimed responsibility.

341
00:35:01,491 --> 00:35:02,605
It left a note?

342
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:12,660
Unless $5 million is transferred
to the following account in 7 days,

343
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:15,757
I will capsize five tankers
in the Ellingson fleet.

344
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:18,264
- Is that...?
- That is the virus.

345
00:35:18,403 --> 00:35:20,352
Leonardo da Vinci.

346
00:35:20,735 --> 00:35:25,119
We have 26 ships at sea
and don't know which ones are infected.

347
00:35:25,398 --> 00:35:29,226
Well, put the ship's ballast
under manual control.

348
00:35:29,366 --> 00:35:30,827
There's no such thing any more.

349
00:35:30,967 --> 00:35:33,369
These ships are totally computerised.

350
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:35,979
They rely on satellite navigation

351
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:40,920
which links them to our network,
and the virus, wherever they are.

352
00:35:41,303 --> 00:35:43,077
What are we supposed to do?

353
00:35:44,294 --> 00:35:47,497
Luckily, you have a gifted
and talented security officer.

354
00:35:47,635 --> 00:35:51,429
I traced the hacker's call.
The Secret Service picked him up.

355
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:56,198
I'll search his files for the original
virus code and eliminate it.

356
00:35:56,337 --> 00:35:59,609
We expect you
to get on this right away.

357
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:04,653
- How soon?
- As fast as I can.

358
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:09,280
This is common in corporations
as large as ours. Don't worry about it.

359
00:36:10,395 --> 00:36:13,004
The Secret Service
is helping us out, 100 percent.

360
00:36:14,814 --> 00:36:16,032
We'll be in touch.

361
00:36:16,555 --> 00:36:18,365
What the hell was that all about?

362
00:36:18,505 --> 00:36:21,846
I had to move fast.
The hacker copied my garbage file.

363
00:36:21,984 --> 00:36:22,960
What?

364
00:36:23,238 --> 00:36:26,752
I created da Vinci so we could
get the Secret Service

365
00:36:26,891 --> 00:36:30,336
to arrest the hacker and seize
the equipment, which we can't do alone.

366
00:36:30,476 --> 00:36:36,984
- I don't want to go to jail for this.
- Relax. Think about the $25 million.

367
00:36:37,124 --> 00:36:43,491
But you created a virus that's going to
cause a worldwide ecological disaster.

368
00:36:43,629 --> 00:36:46,589
Just to arrest some hacker kid?

369
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:48,502
Basically, yes.

370
00:36:49,232 --> 00:36:52,051
Jesus! You're sick, Eugene.

371
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,583
I'll take care of this.

372
00:36:54,767 --> 00:36:58,943
I can cancel it any time.
I don't need the code.

373
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,485
What better way to confiscate the disk

374
00:37:01,624 --> 00:37:04,650
and find out how much of
the garbage file was copied.

375
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:06,808
Get it!

376
00:37:08,373 --> 00:37:11,052
Why did I ever trust you?

377
00:37:12,793 --> 00:37:16,866
Get the file, otherwise
you'll lose all your toys.

378
00:37:24,555 --> 00:37:28,522
Did you find the virus program
on the disks we confiscated?

379
00:37:28,975 --> 00:37:33,151
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.

380
00:37:36,145 --> 00:37:39,833
Then he stashed it somewhere,
or he has an accomplice.

381
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:47,385
We'll release him. Keep tight surveillance
and see if he leads us to your disk.

382
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:57,027
Unit 3, outside suspect
Joey Pardella's apartment.

383
00:37:57,131 --> 00:38:00,227
Suspect still grounded... by his mother.

384
00:38:00,888 --> 00:38:02,140
Listen to this bullshit.

385
00:38:02,661 --> 00:38:07,220
'This is our world now. The world
of the electron and the switch,

386
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,412
'the beauty ofthe baud.

387
00:38:09,517 --> 00:38:14,320
'We exist without nationality,
skin colour or religious bias.

388
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,661
'You wage wars, murder,
cheat, lie to us,

389
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:21,490
'and try to make us believe it's for
our own good, yet we're the criminals.

390
00:38:21,629 --> 00:38:26,117
'Yes, I am a criminal.
My crime is that of curiosity.

391
00:38:26,257 --> 00:38:30,887
'l am a hacker
and this is my manifesto.'

392
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:33,913
Right? Manifesto?

393
00:38:34,088 --> 00:38:35,097
'You may stop me,

394
00:38:35,235 --> 00:38:38,020
'but you can't stop us all.'

395
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:40,317
That's cool.

396
00:38:40,456 --> 00:38:42,509
- Cool?
- Yeah, cool.

397
00:38:42,648 --> 00:38:43,831
You think it's cool?

398
00:38:43,936 --> 00:38:48,948
- It's cool.
- It's not cool. It's commie bullshit.

399
00:38:57,057 --> 00:38:59,110
Can I crash at your place tonight?

400
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,405
What's with him?

401
00:39:01,545 --> 00:39:04,711
His parents missed Woodstock
and he's been making up for it since.

402
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,660
You hear about Joey's bust?

403
00:39:08,573 --> 00:39:11,323
Probably had something to do
with that bank in ldaho.

404
00:39:11,532 --> 00:39:13,341
You think he could hack a Gibson?

405
00:39:14,595 --> 00:39:17,972
- Did you talk to him?
- No. His mom says he's grounded

406
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:22,112
for his next three lifetimes. And no
'consorting with computer friends'.

407
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:24,618
The Secret Service is out to get him.

408
00:39:25,035 --> 00:39:27,576
Want to go to a big party tonight?

409
00:39:28,168 --> 00:39:29,421
It's at Kate's.

410
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:31,719
I thought so.

411
00:39:33,214 --> 00:39:34,536
A little pelvis.

412
00:39:35,546 --> 00:39:36,660
A little pelvis.

413
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,809
What the hell are you doing?

414
00:39:57,226 --> 00:39:58,445
Plague!

415
00:39:58,758 --> 00:39:59,977
Plague!

416
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,063
Gill.

417
00:40:03,038 --> 00:40:04,603
I think we got something.

418
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:08,048
Yuk!... Hard copy!

419
00:40:09,894 --> 00:40:11,390
Dade Murphy.

420
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:15,393
- Secret Service!
- Don't move!

421
00:40:15,532 --> 00:40:16,228
What are you...?

422
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:17,690
Shut up!

423
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:21,934
What are you doing? Get off me!

424
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:24,962
God!

425
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:28,373
Sit on the bed and keep your hands
where we can see them.

426
00:40:30,322 --> 00:40:32,618
The year was 1988.

427
00:40:32,758 --> 00:40:37,525
A nasty virus crashed
1 ,500 systems in one day.

428
00:40:40,622 --> 00:40:42,188
1 ,507.

429
00:40:42,292 --> 00:40:44,103
It got you 7 years' probation.

430
00:40:45,008 --> 00:40:47,688
No computer. No touchtone phones.

431
00:40:49,255 --> 00:40:51,830
Must have been hell, huh, Zero Cool?

432
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:58,024
A virus has been planted in
the Ellingson Mineral computer system.

433
00:40:58,163 --> 00:41:00,563
You were our prime suspect.

434
00:41:00,702 --> 00:41:04,147
Till we trashed your stuff
and found no trace of it.

435
00:41:04,286 --> 00:41:09,019
We believe that Joey Pardella
is involved in this Ellingson virus.

436
00:41:09,332 --> 00:41:14,553
He or his accomplice has a disk that
Mr Belford needs to disable that virus.

437
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:17,755
We want you to help us find it.

438
00:41:17,894 --> 00:41:18,451
Gill.

439
00:41:31,154 --> 00:41:32,267
Loser.

440
00:41:35,016 --> 00:41:37,696
I can't believe you were only 1 1
when you wrote this.

441
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:42,985
It's quite an impressive virus.

442
00:41:45,595 --> 00:41:46,571
Dade.

443
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,287
I know how you might feel about narking
on your friends, but... we're hackers.

444
00:41:53,461 --> 00:41:58,090
For us, there's no such thing
as family and friends.

445
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:03,099
We're each our own country,
with temporary allies and enemies.

446
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:07,901
Let's make a treaty.

447
00:42:09,711 --> 00:42:12,182
I'm sorry. Who are you?

448
00:42:17,056 --> 00:42:19,212
I'm the one who understands you.

449
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:22,763
Now, can we be allies?

450
00:42:25,094 --> 00:42:28,715
Nah. I don't play well with others.

451
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:46,913
Shit! Come on!

452
00:42:47,402 --> 00:42:50,290
Watch which friends you do play with.

453
00:42:50,429 --> 00:42:56,276
With your record, you could land in jail
or get expelled. No college. No future.

454
00:42:57,183 --> 00:43:01,042
Exiled from everyone
and everything you love.

455
00:43:04,557 --> 00:43:06,228
I'll be in touch.

456
00:43:07,725 --> 00:43:09,882
He's fine.
Oh, and Dade,

457
00:43:11,483 --> 00:43:14,442
- try to stay out of trouble, okay?
- Blow me.

458
00:43:15,938 --> 00:43:17,017
Thank you.

459
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:27,281
Her Mom makes big bucks
writing books for women.

460
00:44:27,593 --> 00:44:31,038
Stuff like 'Women Who Love Men
Who Are Emotional Amoebae'.

461
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:33,021
That explains a lot.

462
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:53,311
Big man, stepping in.
Coming through.

463
00:44:53,868 --> 00:44:57,138
Big man, big boots.
You look good, girl.

464
00:45:01,104 --> 00:45:05,211
- Yo, what's up, Nikon?
- In the house, man. Thanks.

465
00:45:05,768 --> 00:45:07,229
Dade, man. You made it.

466
00:45:08,656 --> 00:45:10,466
Houston, we have lift-off.

467
00:45:10,606 --> 00:45:13,599
Three o'clock. Check it.
Don't look right away!

468
00:45:13,738 --> 00:45:15,270
Look at her, man.

469
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:24,214
Lisa Blair.
26 East 7th Street, apartment 16.

470
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:25,606
555 4817.

471
00:45:25,745 --> 00:45:26,580
Boom!

472
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:30,233
- How'd you know that?
- I got a photographic memory.

473
00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:32,217
It's a curse.

474
00:45:32,392 --> 00:45:33,644
Lisa!

475
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:44,780
Oh! Look at that pooper, man.
Spandex, it's a privilege, not a right.

476
00:45:51,393 --> 00:45:54,108
Hi, my name's Vicki and I'm an addict.

477
00:45:55,606 --> 00:45:58,178
Hi. My name's Hank and I'm an addict.

478
00:46:00,614 --> 00:46:02,006
My name's Joey, but...

479
00:46:03,154 --> 00:46:04,234
I'm not an addict.

480
00:46:05,417 --> 00:46:06,670
No, really. Listen.

481
00:46:06,878 --> 00:46:08,549
I got in trouble with my computer.

482
00:46:08,689 --> 00:46:12,726
My lawyer told the judge I'm an addict,
but I'm not addicted to my computer.

483
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:14,082
No, really.

484
00:46:14,848 --> 00:46:15,961
I'm not an addict.

485
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:17,213
I'm not.

486
00:46:18,884 --> 00:46:20,241
Can I get some more coffee?

487
00:46:32,178 --> 00:46:34,615
Yo! Check this out.
This is insanely great.

488
00:46:34,754 --> 00:46:36,911
It's got a 28.8 bps modem.

489
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:39,975
- Yeah? Display?
- Active matrix.

490
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,203
A million psychedelic colours.

491
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,908
This baby is sweet.

492
00:46:44,848 --> 00:46:47,632
- I want it.
- I want it to have my children.

493
00:46:47,945 --> 00:46:49,823
- Bet it looks crispy in the dark.
- Hit the light.

494
00:47:07,988 --> 00:47:09,206
Shit!

495
00:47:10,459 --> 00:47:12,547
Come on. Get out.

496
00:47:12,687 --> 00:47:15,053
- Was that her top?
- One-handed.

497
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,793
Difficulty rating?

498
00:47:17,976 --> 00:47:18,985
Seven.

499
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:26,050
Wow!... Burn's wetware
matches her software.

500
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,113
Burn?

501
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:32,211
What are you doing here?

502
00:47:32,315 --> 00:47:35,168
We're sorry! Just looking
at your fly laptop.

503
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:36,733
It's hype, you know.

504
00:47:36,873 --> 00:47:38,335
You're in the butter zone now, baby.

505
00:47:41,502 --> 00:47:42,824
Yeah, it is.

506
00:47:44,425 --> 00:47:45,922
I want to triple the RAM.

507
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,794
Leopard boy and the deceptor cons.

508
00:47:52,013 --> 00:47:55,839
Kate! You're not going into that
computer shit now, right?

509
00:47:57,822 --> 00:47:59,075
Later, babe.

510
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,564
- Yeah, right.
- The sensitive type.

511
00:48:05,826 --> 00:48:07,183
What's he doing here?

512
00:48:07,323 --> 00:48:08,960
He's my guest, Burn.

513
00:48:09,412 --> 00:48:10,525
You're Acid Burn?!

514
00:48:10,665 --> 00:48:12,545
You booted me out of OTV.

515
00:48:13,415 --> 00:48:16,024
- What?
- I'm Crash Override.

516
00:48:16,789 --> 00:48:19,643
You're the moron
who's been invading my turf?

517
00:48:21,314 --> 00:48:22,532
Whoa, whoa! Crash...

518
00:48:22,671 --> 00:48:23,715
and Burn!

519
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,783
Murphy kid turn you down?

520
00:48:38,887 --> 00:48:45,326
I disguised myself as an Alabama State
Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.

521
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:46,719
Pervert.

522
00:48:47,449 --> 00:48:49,398
What are you talking about?

523
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:55,695
The FBI computer holds files
on 20 million Americans.

524
00:48:56,461 --> 00:48:58,341
I just hacked into it.

525
00:48:58,828 --> 00:49:00,429
Congratulations.

526
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:05,093
I have access to every piece of data
stored on Dade Murphy's parents.

527
00:49:06,137 --> 00:49:11,566
His parents separated five years ago,
reconciled, then divorced last year.

528
00:49:11,705 --> 00:49:12,853
Custody battle.

529
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:15,185
Boy chose to go with his mother.

530
00:49:15,567 --> 00:49:16,576
So?

531
00:49:17,899 --> 00:49:23,155
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.

532
00:50:10,136 --> 00:50:11,737
What the hell are you doing?

533
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:14,485
It's cool, I'm just looking.

534
00:50:16,051 --> 00:50:18,731
- It's too much machine for you.
- Yeah?

535
00:50:29,868 --> 00:50:32,128
I hope you don't screw like you type.

536
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,830
It has a killer refresh rate.

537
00:50:42,187 --> 00:50:45,912
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.

538
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:49,323
It's not just the chip. It has a PCI bus.

539
00:50:49,461 --> 00:50:51,583
But... you knew that.

540
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:53,879
Indeed.

541
00:50:54,296 --> 00:50:56,523
RISC architecture is going
to change everything.

542
00:50:56,628 --> 00:50:59,098
Yeah. RISC is good.

543
00:51:04,109 --> 00:51:07,278
Sure this sweet machine's
not going to waste?

544
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:12,011
Crash Override. What was it?

545
00:51:12,324 --> 00:51:16,500
'Mess with the best, die like the rest'?

546
00:51:17,162 --> 00:51:18,171
Yeah.

547
00:51:22,903 --> 00:51:24,295
Are you challenging me?

548
00:51:24,435 --> 00:51:25,514
Name your stakes.

549
00:51:26,592 --> 00:51:29,864
If I win, you become my slave.

550
00:51:31,986 --> 00:51:32,960
Your slave?

551
00:51:33,516 --> 00:51:34,700
You wish.

552
00:51:35,674 --> 00:51:38,703
You'll do shit work.
Scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.

553
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:40,721
Deal. And if I win?

554
00:51:40,861 --> 00:51:43,192
Make it my first born.

555
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:45,733
- Make it our first date.
- You won't win.

556
00:51:46,951 --> 00:51:48,134
And you have to smile.

557
00:51:48,274 --> 00:51:50,951
I don't do dates.

558
00:51:51,717 --> 00:51:54,920
But I don't lose, either. So you're on.

559
00:52:01,289 --> 00:52:04,142
Here's the deal, the chosen contest:

560
00:52:04,281 --> 00:52:08,041
To hassle Secret Service Agent
Richard Gill and get one back for Joey.

561
00:52:13,608 --> 00:52:17,818
Our decisions are final
by a vote oftwo to one. No appeals.

562
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:24,012
The duel will last
until we declare a winner.

563
00:52:27,597 --> 00:52:32,330
Use only the access codes
and passwords in your collection.

564
00:52:32,469 --> 00:52:33,861
No help from us.

565
00:52:39,187 --> 00:52:40,580
Talkin' to me?

566
00:52:42,634 --> 00:52:44,060
Any questions?

567
00:52:44,198 --> 00:52:47,888
Yeah. Who's going to notify
his next of kin?

568
00:53:41,167 --> 00:53:43,325
He's in the personal ads.

569
00:53:46,387 --> 00:53:50,979
'Disappointed white male, cross-dresser,
looking for discreet friend

570
00:53:51,118 --> 00:53:53,415
'to bring dreams to reality.

571
00:53:53,555 --> 00:53:59,191
'Leather, lace and water sports.
Transvestites welcome.'

572
00:53:59,331 --> 00:54:02,533
I know where you can stick it.

573
00:54:03,334 --> 00:54:06,363
Ijust want to lick
your earlobes and your lips.

574
00:54:06,988 --> 00:54:09,250
You want to lick something? Lick this!

575
00:54:10,434 --> 00:54:12,208
That's why they call me Stallion.

576
00:54:12,348 --> 00:54:13,740
That's disgusting!

577
00:54:14,088 --> 00:54:15,793
My heart is steaming for you...

578
00:54:16,142 --> 00:54:19,377
- ..spank you with...
- I'll spank your ass!

579
00:54:19,552 --> 00:54:21,848
- ..turn you over and...
- Agghh!

580
00:54:22,405 --> 00:54:23,101
Animal!

581
00:55:07,715 --> 00:55:10,986
Hey!... Hey! Do you know who I am?

582
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:13,005
Do you know who I am?

583
00:55:36,149 --> 00:55:40,500
This is Accounting, sir. You inquired
about Agent Richard Gill?

584
00:55:40,638 --> 00:55:41,473
Yes.

585
00:55:41,613 --> 00:55:45,441
- Our records indicate he's deceased.
- I'm what?

586
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:46,901
- Dead.
- Dead?

587
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:50,206
Yeah. Like rigor mortis, habeas corpus.

588
00:55:50,345 --> 00:55:53,582
- Very impressive.
- Superhero-like, even.

589
00:55:54,626 --> 00:55:55,739
Yeah, whatever.

590
00:55:56,819 --> 00:55:58,106
What's the score?

591
00:56:01,238 --> 00:56:02,214
Tie.

592
00:56:04,371 --> 00:56:06,912
Come on. Due to Mr Gill's
untimely demise,

593
00:56:07,016 --> 00:56:10,322
- you'll have to improvise the next round.
- Right.

594
00:56:11,366 --> 00:56:12,793
I win,

595
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:15,715
you wear a dress on our date.

596
00:56:16,828 --> 00:56:17,837
And if I win,

597
00:56:18,465 --> 00:56:19,822
so do you.

598
00:56:24,834 --> 00:56:25,774
Deal.

599
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:04,994
Dade.

600
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:09,344
I didn't know your size,
so... I guessed.

601
00:57:11,432 --> 00:57:13,068
You will stick with the deal?

602
00:57:24,099 --> 00:57:25,109
Thanks.

603
00:57:38,646 --> 00:57:43,136
You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool?
Let me explain...

604
00:57:43,275 --> 00:57:45,258
the new world order.

605
00:57:45,397 --> 00:57:48,737
Governments and corporations
need people like you...

606
00:57:48,842 --> 00:57:50,513
and me.

607
00:57:50,651 --> 00:57:55,176
We are the samurai,
the keyboard cowboys.

608
00:57:55,315 --> 00:57:57,230
And those otherpeople out there,

609
00:57:57,369 --> 00:58:01,511
who have no idea what's going on,
are the cattle.

610
00:58:01,615 --> 00:58:03,737
Moo.

611
00:58:03,877 --> 00:58:07,947
I need your help. You need my help.

612
00:58:08,087 --> 00:58:11,079
Let me help you earn your spurs.

613
00:58:12,472 --> 00:58:13,515
Think about it.

614
00:58:14,977 --> 00:58:18,040
Enjoy the laptop... Cool.

615
00:58:19,293 --> 00:58:21,346
Tell me where the disk is.

616
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:30,394
You look pitiful.

617
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:36,799
Okay, you're not grounded any more.

618
00:59:03,177 --> 00:59:06,065
- Yo, what's up?
- I gotta talk to you, man. Listen.

619
00:59:06,204 --> 00:59:09,963
- I copied a garbage file.
- So? A garbage file has shit in it.

620
00:59:10,102 --> 00:59:12,260
It's hot or something.

621
00:59:12,363 --> 00:59:17,097
Joey, a garbage file holds odd data.
Stuff that's been erased.

622
00:59:17,236 --> 00:59:19,219
I copied it from Ellingson, okay?

623
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:22,179
They're asking me about it.
Will you take a look for me?

624
00:59:25,379 --> 00:59:26,876
Shit, Joey. You got a tail.

625
00:59:28,372 --> 00:59:29,347
Shit!

626
01:00:14,692 --> 01:00:17,580
I am watching you.

627
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,001
Wake up.

628
01:00:23,881 --> 01:00:24,957
Ramon?

629
01:00:25,305 --> 01:00:28,542
Wake up. Ramon, it's time for school.

630
01:00:29,656 --> 01:00:30,630
Come on.

631
01:00:33,276 --> 01:00:35,398
Stick your hands up! Don't move!

632
01:00:35,538 --> 01:00:36,687
Deja vu!

633
01:00:36,825 --> 01:00:40,515
You're under arrest under the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.

634
01:00:41,209 --> 01:00:42,359
!La computadora de mierda!

635
01:00:42,498 --> 01:00:44,375
!Que te dije de no estar
jugando con esa

636
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,882
- computadora!
- What are you waiting for? Arrest me!

637
01:00:58,263 --> 01:01:00,490
You get one call.

638
01:01:01,813 --> 01:01:03,134
Uno.

639
01:01:03,934 --> 01:01:05,570
Understand?

640
01:01:20,674 --> 01:01:22,588
Operator Services?

641
01:01:22,693 --> 01:01:24,745
- I'm having trouble with a number.
- What number, please?

642
01:01:24,885 --> 01:01:26,833
555 4202.

643
01:01:26,973 --> 01:01:28,539
- Just one moment.
- Thank you.

644
01:01:30,141 --> 01:01:32,299
- Hello?
- It's me. I'm freaking.

645
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:36,718
Joey really hacked into Ellingson.
He gave me the disk he copied

646
01:01:36,857 --> 01:01:39,675
and now I'm injail
for some serious shit!

647
01:01:39,815 --> 01:01:43,466
Stuff I didn't even do, like inserting
a virus called 'da Vinci'?

648
01:01:43,606 --> 01:01:45,590
And they keep asking about you guys.

649
01:01:45,729 --> 01:01:47,330
- Think they're gonna bust us?
- Yeah.

650
01:01:47,434 --> 01:01:50,498
You better figure out what's on that disk
'cause we're being framed.

651
01:01:50,602 --> 01:01:52,759
It's in the place where
I put that thing once.

652
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:29,336
Hi.

653
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:32,921
Now I see what all the fuss is about.

654
01:02:39,985 --> 01:02:41,517
You have company.

655
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:47,257
- Nice room.
- We need your help.

656
01:02:49,275 --> 01:02:51,502
Do my ears deceive me?

657
01:02:54,043 --> 01:02:57,280
No, no. Truce, you guys.
We got a higher purpose here.

658
01:02:57,454 --> 01:02:59,683
A wake-up call for
the Nintendo generation.

659
01:02:59,787 --> 01:03:01,527
We demand free access to data.

660
01:03:01,632 --> 01:03:04,310
Well, it comes with some responsibility.

661
01:03:04,554 --> 01:03:08,764
'When I was a child, I spake as a child,
I thought as a child.

662
01:03:08,904 --> 01:03:11,932
'But when I became a man,
I put away childish things'.

663
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:15,620
What? It's Corinthians One,

664
01:03:15,726 --> 01:03:19,450
Chapter 1 3, verse 1 1 , you know?
Come on.

665
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:26,234
Phreak and Joey are being framed.

666
01:03:26,374 --> 01:03:28,740
Can you help us find out
what's on this disk?

667
01:03:28,949 --> 01:03:29,993
I can't.

668
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:33,753
Everybody who touches that disk
gets arrested. I can't risk arrest.

669
01:03:33,891 --> 01:03:35,074
I'm sorry.

670
01:03:39,389 --> 01:03:41,650
Maybe I should go to the bathroom.

671
01:03:49,447 --> 01:03:50,944
What is it with you?

672
01:03:51,952 --> 01:03:56,512
We're supposed to be on the same side
and we really need your help.

673
01:03:58,112 --> 01:03:59,957
I really need your help.

674
01:04:02,253 --> 01:04:04,654
I'm sorry. I can't.

675
01:04:09,143 --> 01:04:10,675
Could you copy the disk?

676
01:04:10,814 --> 01:04:14,747
And just hide it in case we get busted
so we have a copy for our lawyers.

677
01:04:14,886 --> 01:04:16,870
Something that hasn't been
tampered with.

678
01:04:21,498 --> 01:04:23,516
You guys help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

679
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:25,152
Cereal has.

680
01:04:31,383 --> 01:04:33,783
Okay. I'll copy it.

681
01:04:33,992 --> 01:04:34,967
Thank you.

682
01:04:42,238 --> 01:04:44,117
The girl. The girl has the disk I need.

683
01:04:45,406 --> 01:04:47,877
I told you.
I don't play well with others.

684
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:50,591
Turn on your laptop.

685
01:04:51,426 --> 01:04:53,585
Set it to receive a file.

686
01:05:01,518 --> 01:05:05,660
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon
in the state of Washington.

687
01:05:07,086 --> 01:05:10,392
Forgery, embezzlement,
two drug convictions

688
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:14,778
plus jumping parole. Once arrested,
she will have no trial,

689
01:05:14,918 --> 01:05:19,129
she will notpass 'Go',
she will go directly tojail.

690
01:05:19,268 --> 01:05:25,114
Then I change this file back to the original
and your mom disappears.

691
01:05:25,253 --> 01:05:26,471
That's bullshit.

692
01:05:27,098 --> 01:05:31,030
What can I tell you?
Computers never lie, kid.

693
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:37,817
Your mom will be arrested,
handcuffed and later strip-searched.

694
01:05:37,956 --> 01:05:40,599
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.

695
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:43,767
Kid, don't threaten me.

696
01:05:44,253 --> 01:05:48,881
There are worse things than death...
and I can do all of them.

697
01:06:28,312 --> 01:06:29,460
Talk to me.

698
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:33,115
I got it. But Kate didn't know
what's on it,

699
01:06:33,254 --> 01:06:35,271
she came to me to figure it out.

700
01:06:36,141 --> 01:06:38,993
She didn't plant the virus.
You leave her alone.

701
01:06:39,099 --> 01:06:42,928
Don't worry, kid. Ifshe's innocent,

702
01:06:43,066 --> 01:06:44,563
she'll be fine.

703
01:06:46,234 --> 01:06:48,984
Your mommy's safe now, okay?

704
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:12,748
Kate, Listen.

705
01:08:13,445 --> 01:08:14,628
Hold on.

706
01:08:14,768 --> 01:08:17,517
- I have to tell you something.
- Hold on!

707
01:08:17,795 --> 01:08:21,066
- It's so lean and clean.
- Looks like a hacker wrote it.

708
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:23,467
Come here. Look at this.

709
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:25,869
This thing is tense.

710
01:08:26,878 --> 01:08:28,549
That's ill, man.

711
01:08:29,036 --> 01:08:30,533
It's incomplete.

712
01:08:31,856 --> 01:08:35,439
This'll take forever to figure out.
I'll make some coffee.

713
01:08:38,779 --> 01:08:40,275
Tag, you're in.

714
01:10:00,595 --> 01:10:04,457
- It's not a virus. It's a worm.
- What's it eat?

715
01:10:04,597 --> 01:10:06,407
It nibbles. You see all of this?

716
01:10:06,511 --> 01:10:09,818
This is all of Ellingson's
financial transactions.

717
01:10:09,922 --> 01:10:13,472
From million dollar deals
to $10 some guy pays for gas.

718
01:10:13,611 --> 01:10:15,595
The worm eats a few cents
from each transaction.

719
01:10:15,734 --> 01:10:18,240
No-one's caught it because
the money isn't really gone.

720
01:10:18,378 --> 01:10:20,188
It's just data being shifted around.

721
01:10:20,328 --> 01:10:24,540
And when the worm's ready, it zips out
with the money and erases its tracks.

722
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:27,115
Joey got cut off before he got to that part.
Check it out.

723
01:10:27,255 --> 01:10:31,325
Here it's already running
at twice the speed as when it started.

724
01:10:31,464 --> 01:10:34,179
- At this rate, the run ends in...
- ..two days.

725
01:10:34,318 --> 01:10:38,945
- It's already eaten about...
- ..21 .8 million bucks.

726
01:10:40,232 --> 01:10:43,226
Whoever wrote this
needs someone to take the fall.

727
01:10:43,365 --> 01:10:46,150
That's Phreak and Joey and us.

728
01:10:46,288 --> 01:10:50,535
We have to find out where the money's
going before the worm disappears,

729
01:10:50,674 --> 01:10:52,971
so we can find out who created it.

730
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:54,363
I know who wrote it!

731
01:10:54,816 --> 01:10:55,754
What?

732
01:10:55,859 --> 01:10:57,530
This Ellingson security creep.

733
01:10:58,121 --> 01:11:01,253
I gave him a copy of the disk
you gave me.

734
01:11:01,391 --> 01:11:02,297
You what?

735
01:11:02,435 --> 01:11:04,140
I didn't know what was on it.

736
01:11:04,244 --> 01:11:07,725
Oh, man! That's universally stupid, man.

737
01:11:07,829 --> 01:11:09,431
Yo, man. You're an amateur.

738
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:12,181
Why did he come to you?

739
01:11:12,321 --> 01:11:14,095
I've got a record.

740
01:11:14,513 --> 01:11:16,148
I was Zero Cool.

741
01:11:16,287 --> 01:11:22,483
Zero Cool crashed 1 ,507 systems
in one day. Biggest crash in history.

742
01:11:22,621 --> 01:11:25,649
Front page New York Times,
August 10, 1988.

743
01:11:26,938 --> 01:11:28,711
I thought you was black, man.

744
01:11:29,303 --> 01:11:31,669
Yo, man, this is Zero Cool!

745
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:33,653
That's far out!

746
01:11:33,793 --> 01:11:35,182
This is Zero Cool, man!

747
01:11:36,575 --> 01:11:38,176
Yeah, that's great.

748
01:11:38,592 --> 01:11:39,532
There goes MIT.

749
01:11:39,672 --> 01:11:41,794
- I'll make it up!
- How?

750
01:11:43,047 --> 01:11:44,301
I'll hack the Gibson.

751
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,458
They'll trace you like that, man.

752
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:48,408
The cops will find you
with a smoking gun.

753
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:49,799
Fucked if I care, man.

754
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:53,142
Even with the password,
it'd take you ten minutes to get in,

755
01:11:53,281 --> 01:11:54,915
then you'd have to find the files.

756
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,318
The cops would have you in five minutes.

757
01:11:57,456 --> 01:12:00,135
Oh, wow! We are fried!

758
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:02,780
Never send a boy to do a woman's job.

759
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,043
With me, we can do it in seven.

760
01:12:05,251 --> 01:12:07,827
I help, we do it in six.

761
01:12:07,967 --> 01:12:12,213
I gotta save all your asses!
I help, we do it in five minutes.

762
01:12:12,352 --> 01:12:14,821
Okay. Let's go shopping.

763
01:12:43,254 --> 01:12:44,333
You know,

764
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:50,005
if I didn't live by a strict code of honour,
I might take advantage of this situation.

765
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:52,163
Erotically, as it were.

766
01:13:16,837 --> 01:13:18,751
All right. Hold it right there.

767
01:13:24,007 --> 01:13:25,329
Shit!

768
01:13:25,468 --> 01:13:27,486
My subway defence system.

769
01:13:33,263 --> 01:13:34,793
He's way down there.

770
01:13:36,602 --> 01:13:37,612
Ta-da!

771
01:13:38,134 --> 01:13:41,649
- Yo, brain-dead... the manual!
- Oops!

772
01:13:47,705 --> 01:13:48,679
Hey!

773
01:13:49,271 --> 01:13:50,280
Truck!

774
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:55,500
Find it?

775
01:13:56,787 --> 01:14:00,128
The phone's all right. The problem
must be somewhere else.

776
01:14:40,043 --> 01:14:44,290
They had a large chunk
of the garbage file?

777
01:14:47,109 --> 01:14:50,694
- How much do they know?
- Enough to implicate us.

778
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:53,478
You said the worm was untraceable.

779
01:14:53,617 --> 01:14:56,575
Yeah... to civilians.
But they're hackers.

780
01:14:56,714 --> 01:15:00,369
Don't worry.
We just launch the da Vinci virus.

781
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:03,953
- Then they'll all be put away.
- Launch the da Vinci virus?

782
01:15:04,093 --> 01:15:07,851
- You can't do that.
- No-one believes the guilty.

783
01:15:07,955 --> 01:15:13,835
By the time they realise the truth,
we'll be long gone with all our money.

784
01:15:14,602 --> 01:15:17,734
Look, there is no right and wrong.

785
01:15:17,943 --> 01:15:20,797
There is only fun... and boring.

786
01:15:21,805 --> 01:15:25,390
A 30-year prison sentence
sounds pretty dull to me.

787
01:15:25,738 --> 01:15:27,199
Who do you prefer serves it?

788
01:15:27,339 --> 01:15:29,914
Us... or them?

789
01:15:47,733 --> 01:15:53,161
Unless $5 million is transferred
to the following account in seven days,

790
01:15:53,265 --> 01:15:56,292
I will capsize five Ellingson tankers.

791
01:15:56,431 --> 01:15:58,833
The virus goes off
tomorrow at 10.30AM,

792
01:15:58,937 --> 01:16:01,652
and those hackers tried
to get into our system again.

793
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:04,784
I insist you take more strenuous action

794
01:16:04,924 --> 01:16:08,856
or Ellingson Mineral will hold
the Secret Service responsible.

795
01:16:12,545 --> 01:16:15,955
Get me arrest warrants
on Kate Libby, alias Acid Burn,

796
01:16:16,094 --> 01:16:18,496
Emmanuel Goldstein,
alias Cereal Killer,

797
01:16:18,635 --> 01:16:21,594
Dade Murphy,
alias Crash Override, also known as

798
01:16:21,734 --> 01:16:26,640
Zero Cool, and Paul Cook,
alias Lord Nikon.

799
01:16:26,987 --> 01:16:29,424
Pick them up tomorrow at 9.00AM.

800
01:16:31,266 --> 01:16:32,310
Snoop on to them

801
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:34,503
as they snoop on to us.

802
01:16:39,689 --> 01:16:44,284
- Yeah, it's Kate.
- Hey, Burn. We got a little problem.

803
01:17:02,344 --> 01:17:03,422
So, what've we got?

804
01:17:03,562 --> 01:17:08,123
Well, 50 passwords, plus whatever
Polaroid-head got inside Ellingson.

805
01:17:08,227 --> 01:17:09,862
I got a lot, right?

806
01:17:10,211 --> 01:17:12,020
I don't know how many, but...

807
01:17:12,994 --> 01:17:14,108
my head hurts.

808
01:17:14,247 --> 01:17:15,743
Yo, check this out.

809
01:17:16,613 --> 01:17:18,249
- What's a da Vinci virus?
- What?

810
01:17:18,389 --> 01:17:23,156
It's a memo about how they'll deal with
the oil spills that happened on the 14th.

811
01:17:24,304 --> 01:17:25,627
What oil spills?

812
01:17:27,681 --> 01:17:31,472
- Brain-dead. Today's the 1 3th.
- Well, this hasn't happened yet.

813
01:17:31,681 --> 01:17:34,360
The 14th is the day the worm ends it run.

814
01:17:37,109 --> 01:17:40,694
Isn't the da Vinci virus
what Phreak's being charged with?

815
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:44,801
Look. 'lnfecting ballast programs
of Ellingson tankers'.

816
01:17:45,115 --> 01:17:46,228
They blame hackers!

817
01:17:46,368 --> 01:17:47,376
Damn!

818
01:17:47,655 --> 01:17:49,605
A worm and a virus?

819
01:17:49,779 --> 01:17:51,344
The plot thickens.

820
01:17:57,365 --> 01:17:59,244
Whoa, whoa! Where are you going?

821
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:00,392
I got an idea.

822
01:18:01,019 --> 01:18:03,351
We got a few hours until we're arrested.

823
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:06,379
Stay low. I'm going to get help.

824
01:18:06,518 --> 01:18:08,154
I'll beep you.

825
01:18:10,658 --> 01:18:11,632
Are you coming?

826
01:18:16,157 --> 01:18:18,210
May the Force be with you, man.

827
01:18:46,643 --> 01:18:48,104
There they are!

828
01:18:48,627 --> 01:18:52,035
Razor and Blade?! They're flakes!

829
01:18:52,174 --> 01:18:55,689
They're elite! Let's get 'em.

830
01:19:47,545 --> 01:19:50,744
Get off the stage, man! Get off!

831
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:15,872
I lost them!

832
01:20:17,543 --> 01:20:18,864
Where were you?

833
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:35,811
I don't like this.

834
01:20:40,823 --> 01:20:43,120
I definitely don't like this.

835
01:20:43,364 --> 01:20:45,486
What do you want?

836
01:20:49,419 --> 01:20:51,472
We come in peace.

837
01:20:53,595 --> 01:20:56,275
We need your help, if you're up to it.

838
01:20:57,528 --> 01:20:59,790
She's buff. Ballsy.

839
01:21:00,799 --> 01:21:01,878
Let's keep her.

840
01:21:02,017 --> 01:21:03,166
Waste the dude.

841
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:14,963
A virus called da Vinci will cause
oil spills tomorrow at 10.30AM.

842
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:17,816
It's somehow connected to that worm.

843
01:21:17,955 --> 01:21:22,828
We need you to overload the Gibson so
we can kill da Vinci and copy the worm.

844
01:21:23,384 --> 01:21:26,239
She's rabid... but cute.

845
01:21:26,691 --> 01:21:29,404
See, we're very busy.

846
01:21:29,542 --> 01:21:35,669
A TV network that wishes to remain
nameless is interested in our show.

847
01:21:36,539 --> 01:21:37,966
Let's go, Kate.

848
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:42,176
Wait.

849
01:21:43,047 --> 01:21:45,100
Nobody said no.

850
01:21:45,657 --> 01:21:49,901
But you will need more than
just two media icons like us.

851
01:21:50,389 --> 01:21:51,398
You need an army.

852
01:21:51,537 --> 01:21:56,723
That's it. An electronic army.
If I were us,

853
01:21:56,862 --> 01:22:00,795
I'd get on the lnternet,
send out a major distress signal.

854
01:22:01,317 --> 01:22:02,814
Hackers of the world, unite!

855
01:22:03,092 --> 01:22:04,693
How will you take care of the cops?

856
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,895
I'm blowing up!

857
01:22:27,033 --> 01:22:29,574
It's Kate. Grand Central.
Let's hit it!

858
01:23:38,271 --> 01:23:39,350
You're the man!

859
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,299
You're the man!

860
01:24:02,111 --> 01:24:03,990
Joey, you made it!

861
01:24:08,513 --> 01:24:11,228
Okay. Use your best viruses
to buy us some time.

862
01:24:11,368 --> 01:24:13,177
We must get in and copy the worm.

863
01:24:15,752 --> 01:24:17,770
I had to do that to break the tension.

864
01:24:18,676 --> 01:24:21,355
- Cereal. Go fix the phones.
- Roger.

865
01:24:23,618 --> 01:24:25,425
Joey, take his place.

866
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:28,522
- Me?
- Take his place. Do it.

867
01:24:28,766 --> 01:24:30,160
You can do it.

868
01:24:31,204 --> 01:24:32,213
Ready?

869
01:24:33,918 --> 01:24:35,554
Let's boot up.

870
01:25:31,408 --> 01:25:34,958
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Nothing. Just a minor glitch.

871
01:25:35,098 --> 01:25:38,300
A minor glitch with you seems
to turn into a major catastrophe.

872
01:25:44,493 --> 01:25:46,477
There's a new virus in the database.

873
01:25:46,616 --> 01:25:47,834
What's happening?

874
01:25:47,973 --> 01:25:50,095
It's eating memory. What do I do?

875
01:25:50,234 --> 01:25:51,382
Type 'cookie', you idiot.

876
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:53,436
I'll head them off at the pass.

877
01:25:57,717 --> 01:26:00,225
We have a bug attacking all log-in files.

878
01:26:00,363 --> 01:26:02,730
Run anti-virus.
Give me a systems display.

879
01:26:10,108 --> 01:26:11,639
Die, dickweeds!

880
01:26:15,292 --> 01:26:16,893
A rabbit's in the system.

881
01:26:17,033 --> 01:26:17,868
Send a flu shot.

882
01:26:18,007 --> 01:26:20,757
Rabbit? Flu shot? Someone talk to me.

883
01:26:20,896 --> 01:26:25,035
A rabbit replicates till it overloads
a file then spreads like cancer.

884
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:26,218
Cancer?

885
01:26:27,089 --> 01:26:31,195
Row, row, row your boat

886
01:26:31,334 --> 01:26:33,701
Gently down the stream.

887
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,764
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,

888
01:26:36,869 --> 01:26:39,270
Life is but a dream.

889
01:26:40,941 --> 01:26:42,540
Whoa! Falling off!

890
01:26:43,411 --> 01:26:45,185
It's a Gibson, it's finding us too fast.

891
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:03,699
There's too many garbage files.
I need more time.

892
01:27:10,416 --> 01:27:15,149
They're at Grand Central station,
lower level. Don't screw up.

893
01:27:15,289 --> 01:27:16,750
Get out of here!

894
01:27:16,889 --> 01:27:20,021
Everyone, let's move! Move it!

895
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:22,247
Get the hell out of the way! Come on!

896
01:27:22,386 --> 01:27:24,057
Grand Central!

897
01:27:28,373 --> 01:27:32,202
Game's over. Last chance to get out
of this without a prison sentence.

898
01:27:32,307 --> 01:27:33,664
You're not good enough to beat me.

899
01:27:33,768 --> 01:27:37,457
Maybe I'm not. But we are,

900
01:27:37,561 --> 01:27:40,032
- you asshole!
- Give it up!

901
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:43,824
Just give it up.

902
01:27:47,617 --> 01:27:49,080
Are we fashionably late?

903
01:27:55,031 --> 01:27:56,353
Okay, let's go!

904
01:29:03,345 --> 01:29:06,756
We have massive infection.
Multiple GPI viruses...

905
01:29:06,895 --> 01:29:08,148
..from remote nodes.

906
01:29:08,287 --> 01:29:10,757
- They're going for the kernel.
- Colonel who?

907
01:29:10,897 --> 01:29:12,949
The command processor. The brain!

908
01:29:13,089 --> 01:29:15,142
Cancer, brain. Brain cancer!

909
01:29:15,839 --> 01:29:16,953
What's going on?

910
01:29:17,092 --> 01:29:19,458
In short, Duke, a shitstorm.

911
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:23,388
Move! Go!

912
01:30:04,559 --> 01:30:06,125
I found it!

913
01:30:06,855 --> 01:30:08,143
I found it!

914
01:30:32,714 --> 01:30:35,184
This is the end, my friend.

915
01:30:36,854 --> 01:30:38,141
Thank you for calling.

916
01:30:41,725 --> 01:30:42,769
Shit!

917
01:30:42,943 --> 01:30:44,231
He got me!

918
01:30:44,892 --> 01:30:46,145
Joey's gettin' stupid busy.

919
01:30:47,641 --> 01:30:51,157
Joey, go after the worm.
You're the closest.

920
01:30:52,653 --> 01:30:56,169
It's root, slash, period, 'workspace',

921
01:30:56,273 --> 01:30:59,023
slash, period, 'garbage', period.

922
01:31:02,294 --> 01:31:03,859
Out of the way!

923
01:31:07,304 --> 01:31:09,601
Out of the way! Freeze!

924
01:31:13,604 --> 01:31:14,195
Come on!

925
01:31:40,295 --> 01:31:40,990
All right! Wow!

926
01:31:42,904 --> 01:31:43,983
Kill the Gibson!

927
01:31:44,087 --> 01:31:45,097
Roger that.

928
01:31:51,048 --> 01:31:54,006
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Is that all you got?

929
01:31:54,599 --> 01:31:57,035
Come on! Let's see what else you can do.

930
01:31:57,139 --> 01:32:02,082
You talking to me, huh?
Are you nuts? Come at me!

931
01:32:05,804 --> 01:32:07,579
They're in the kernel.

932
01:32:07,719 --> 01:32:08,901
Help me!

933
01:32:11,582 --> 01:32:14,505
The tankers have stopped capsizing.

934
01:32:14,645 --> 01:32:16,384
Ballast tanks emptying.

935
01:32:16,524 --> 01:32:17,986
Should be okay.

936
01:32:31,174 --> 01:32:32,949
Little pissant!

937
01:32:45,303 --> 01:32:46,313
Yes!

938
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:50,141
Let's get outta here!

939
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:51,011
Freeze!

940
01:33:11,091 --> 01:33:13,353
They're trashing our rights, man.

941
01:33:13,457 --> 01:33:16,520
They're trashing the flow of data.

942
01:33:16,659 --> 01:33:17,840
Trashing!

943
01:33:18,083 --> 01:33:19,198
Trashing!

944
01:33:19,476 --> 01:33:20,486
Trashing!

945
01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:23,131
Hack the planet!

946
01:33:23,408 --> 01:33:25,325
- Hack the planet!
- Shut up and get in!

947
01:33:25,429 --> 01:33:27,239
Hack the planet!

948
01:33:27,482 --> 01:33:28,804
Hack the planet!

949
01:33:36,529 --> 01:33:38,791
- Hello.
- We caught them.

950
01:33:38,930 --> 01:33:40,809
- Good.
- Red-handed.

951
01:33:41,749 --> 01:33:43,976
You won't be having
any more trouble from them.

952
01:33:57,375 --> 01:34:02,039
Me, all right? I did it.
She knows shit about computers.

953
01:34:03,708 --> 01:34:05,414
She's just my girlfriend.

954
01:34:08,232 --> 01:34:10,704
I suggest you modify your attitude,

955
01:34:10,843 --> 01:34:12,548
because you are floating

956
01:34:12,688 --> 01:34:14,498
and I am about to flush your ass.

957
01:34:16,134 --> 01:34:19,298
Mrs Murphy is here to see you, sir.

958
01:34:26,607 --> 01:34:29,567
- Are you crazy? What are you doing?
- Trying to help you.

959
01:34:36,073 --> 01:34:37,778
- Dade.
- What?

960
01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:40,249
Thanks for your help.

961
01:34:46,757 --> 01:34:48,914
Your son is in big trouble.

962
01:34:49,228 --> 01:34:53,580
He violated his probation and
has engaged in criminal activities.

963
01:34:54,484 --> 01:34:56,675
My son happens to be a genius.

964
01:34:56,815 --> 01:35:00,956
He understands things that you won't
comprehend if you live to be 100.

965
01:35:01,061 --> 01:35:03,670
He would never use his knowledge
to harm others.

966
01:35:03,809 --> 01:35:05,863
The news crew you requested is here.

967
01:35:06,003 --> 01:35:08,125
Good. I have some things to tell them.

968
01:35:08,368 --> 01:35:12,232
Your son is facing 30 felony counts
in an ongoing investigation.

969
01:35:12,372 --> 01:35:14,739
You face arrest if you do that.

970
01:35:14,877 --> 01:35:16,650
I don't care if I face certain death.

971
01:35:16,788 --> 01:35:19,504
Mrs Murphy stays right here.

972
01:35:21,556 --> 01:35:23,471
Wow. She's great.

973
01:35:24,933 --> 01:35:25,629
Yeah.

974
01:35:28,274 --> 01:35:29,458
..and attacked the Ellingson network.

975
01:35:29,596 --> 01:35:32,693
Is this the last we've seen
of this kind ofespionage?

976
01:35:33,842 --> 01:35:36,939
No. Hackers are a grave threat
to the national security.

977
01:35:37,078 --> 01:35:40,037
This incident just proves
that we need

978
01:35:40,177 --> 01:35:42,716
- increased funding to stop...
- We're getting interference.

979
01:35:42,856 --> 01:35:45,153
Hola, boys and girls.
It is l, Cereal Killer,

980
01:35:45,293 --> 01:35:50,444
making my first worldwide
global television appearance.

981
01:35:51,035 --> 01:35:53,297
Yes, that's right.

982
01:35:53,435 --> 01:35:56,949
I'm here to tell you about this heinous
scheme hatched within Ellingson Mineral.

983
01:35:58,029 --> 01:35:58,865
But for what?

984
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:01,578
World domination? Nay.

985
01:36:01,717 --> 01:36:05,023
Something far more tacky.

986
01:36:05,476 --> 01:36:11,253
A virus called da Vinci, that would cause
Ellingson tankers to capsize,

987
01:36:11,358 --> 01:36:16,089
was to be blamed on innocent hackers.
This virus was really a smokescreen.

988
01:36:16,194 --> 01:36:23,051
What could be so important to protect
that someone would create such a nasty,

989
01:36:23,155 --> 01:36:26,010
anti-social, uncool virus program?

990
01:36:26,149 --> 01:36:27,263
But why?

991
01:36:27,749 --> 01:36:30,290
Could it be to cover the tracks
of this worm program?

992
01:36:30,429 --> 01:36:33,526
A worm that was to steal 25 million bucks.

993
01:36:33,769 --> 01:36:36,691
The password for this worm
belongs to Margo Wallace,

994
01:36:36,796 --> 01:36:39,859
- head ofPublic Relations at Ellingson.
- Oh, my God!

995
01:36:39,998 --> 01:36:41,878
And Eugene Belford,

996
01:36:42,016 --> 01:36:45,531
- computer security officer.
- Son of a bitch!

997
01:36:46,193 --> 01:36:51,066
What's this? The account in the Bahamas
where the money was to be stashed?

998
01:36:51,205 --> 01:36:52,283
I think so.

999
01:36:52,423 --> 01:36:54,163
Unlucky!

1000
01:36:56,042 --> 01:36:57,225
Yo.

1001
01:36:57,330 --> 01:36:59,208
I kinda feel like God.

1002
01:37:04,427 --> 01:37:05,750
Plague?

1003
01:37:08,257 --> 01:37:09,301
Eugene?

1004
01:37:19,705 --> 01:37:25,414
I don't even know how to work the VCR
let alone a computer. Get off!

1005
01:37:25,553 --> 01:37:31,364
Listen, I'll make a deal. Eugene Belford.
I know where his mother is.

1006
01:37:31,504 --> 01:37:33,975
Get off me! I need a lawyer!

1007
01:37:44,553 --> 01:37:46,537
Here you are, Mr Babbage.

1008
01:37:46,641 --> 01:37:50,748
Flight time to Tokyo is 14 hours.
Can I get you anything else?

1009
01:37:50,853 --> 01:37:53,290
Just a pillow, please.

1010
01:37:59,588 --> 01:38:00,701
Thank you.

1011
01:38:03,138 --> 01:38:04,947
You're welcome.

1012
01:38:05,087 --> 01:38:07,801
What's going on? Let go of me!
Stewardess!

1013
01:38:07,941 --> 01:38:10,621
I'll never fly this airline again!

1014
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:23,356
You look good in a dress.

1015
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,314
You would have looked better.

1016
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:34,909
Wanna go for a swim?

1017
01:38:45,630 --> 01:38:48,623
I can't believe they decided you won.

1018
01:38:49,631 --> 01:38:54,051
They didn't. The guys felt it was
the only way I'd get a date.

1019
01:38:57,218 --> 01:38:58,435
Anyway,

1020
01:39:00,209 --> 01:39:01,915
you're pretty good.

1021
01:39:02,298 --> 01:39:03,724
You're elite.

1022
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:06,684
Yeah?

1023
01:39:07,205 --> 01:39:11,904
If you'd said that at the start,
you would have avoided a lot of trouble.

1024
01:39:24,015 --> 01:39:25,510
Beat that!

1025
01:39:39,082 --> 01:39:40,335
You know,

1026
01:39:42,249 --> 01:39:46,217
- I've been having these weird...
- ..dreams.
