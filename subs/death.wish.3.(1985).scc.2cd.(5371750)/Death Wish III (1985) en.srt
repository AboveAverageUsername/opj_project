3
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:25,634
Go around back. Look out.

4
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:53,370
You sons of bitches!

5
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:03,465
Your lucky day, man!

6
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:09,506
Give me the money, home boy.
Give me the money now.

7
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,301
It's collection time, Charley.
Collection time.

8
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:48,125
Get up, you motherfucker!

9
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,554
- You old piece of shit!
- Stay awake while we're killing this guy.

10
00:04:53,557 --> 00:04:57,056
I pulled out
and you went straight into my car.

11
00:04:57,186 --> 00:05:00,934
- Cabbie, 20 buck s, you get us outta here.
- Thanks.

12
00:05:26,922 --> 00:05:28,998
I'm gonna call the police.

13
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:09,796
Charley?

14
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,016
Hey, Charley.
Jeez, Charley, what happened?

15
00:06:24,144 --> 00:06:28,936
Paul... take care of my things, will you?

16
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:31,770
Till I get... back.

17
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:37,233
Move and you're dead, asshole!

18
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:42,025
He's dead. The son of a bitch killed him.

19
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:44,948
- Get him outta here!
- Come on, let's go.

20
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,405
Come on. Move it!

21
00:06:49,793 --> 00:06:52,082
Get in there.

22
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:06,969
Come on, you did it. We know you did it.
You know we know.

23
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:10,600
No bruises, see.

24
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:13,849
You want a glass of water? Huh?

25
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:17,980
- You can't have it.
- Not till you tell us what we wanna know.

26
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:20,400
- Chief.
- Who's this dude?

27
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,986
Mr. Kimble doesn't wanna talk.

28
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:28,326
Leave.

29
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:32,491
Kimble, is it?

30
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:36,957
Son of a bitch.

31
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:39,710
I'll be a son of a bitch.

32
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:43,837
It's not Kimble.

33
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,804
I know you. Kersey.

34
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,007
It's Paul Kersey.

35
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:55,262
I was with the New York PD when they
brought a vigilante in with a bullet in his leg.

36
00:07:55,398 --> 00:07:57,473
You were out like a light.

37
00:07:57,608 --> 00:08:01,606
It's been ten years. Mr. Vigilante.

38
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:06,771
Last damn thing I need is a vigilante.

39
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:11,487
You're in big trouble. What were you doing
in East New York on Belmont?

40
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:13,946
I was visiting a friend.

41
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,616
Maybe you did it.

42
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:24,000
- Probably not.
- I found him that way.

43
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:27,252
And I'm no more Mr. Vigilante.

44
00:08:28,846 --> 00:08:31,087
What do I do with you, dude?

45
00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:35,552
- I don't know, but I want a lawyer.
- No, you don't.

46
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:42,063
Roaches. I hate 'em.

47
00:08:42,192 --> 00:08:46,604
Maybe I should have you killed.
Who's gonna complain?

48
00:08:46,738 --> 00:08:50,687
Do you always violate
people's constitutional rights?

49
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:54,158
This is my jail, Kersey, and I'm the law.

50
00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:57,406
So I get to violate your constitutional rights.

51
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:05,670
- Son of a bitch!
- Cooler!

52
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:09,665
- Come on!
- Watch it.

53
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:12,090
And forget bail!

54
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,554
Watch him! Make sure
he doesn't get comfortable!

55
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:18,220
Hey, Chief, you all right?

56
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,875
Get in there.

57
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,345
Looking for trouble, man?

58
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,139
You fucker!

59
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,534
I tore it out.

60
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:36,167
- You bastard! Fucker!
- Look at him sitting between two bars.

61
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:39,385
That fat motherfucker deserved what he got!

62
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,346
Talk about getting shit-faced!

63
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,851
It's great. Look at that.

64
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:19,831
Hey, Vito, coffee.

65
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:34,179
I wanna move on that one in the corner.

66
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,282
Kill the fucker!

67
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,996
Hey, man, I always win.

68
00:12:04,844 --> 00:12:07,050
Come on!

69
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:11,672
Come on, you! Come on!

70
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:23,065
Get in there!

71
00:12:25,864 --> 00:12:30,360
Fraker, you're being released. Five minutes.

72
00:12:30,493 --> 00:12:33,280
See? I got a lawyer.

73
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:40,415
But I gotta tell you... If they hadn't
broken us up, I would've killed you.

74
00:12:40,544 --> 00:12:44,293
Next time... you won't even see me coming.

75
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:57,476
Tell you what, I'm gonna kill
a little old lady. Just for you.

76
00:12:57,602 --> 00:13:01,053
Catch it on the six o'clock news.

77
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:07,357
You got some free time, come up
to Sutter and Belmont. That's my turf.

78
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,024
So long, asshole.

79
00:13:13,952 --> 00:13:18,529
It's gonna take them a couple of hours
to put the papers through.

80
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,665
Two more hours in this fucking pit!

81
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:27,123
Sure. Whatever you say.

82
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:37,922
Shriker! Inspector Shriker, what are
you doing with this prisoner, Kimble?

83
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:41,640
- Keeping him in jail.
- What's the bail?

84
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,474
- There is no bail.
- What are the charges?

85
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:47,891
- There are no charges.
- Are you out of your mind?

86
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:52,901
You're violating all his rights.
What the hell do you think you're doing?

87
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:58,657
- He'll sue. He's got a case, you know.
- Not likely.

88
00:13:58,786 --> 00:14:03,246
Who is Kimble?
You're gonna have to let him out.

89
00:14:05,376 --> 00:14:08,293
Stay out of this one, Miss Davis.

90
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:14,998
Three murders. Four rapes. Eight muggings.
Nine acts of random violence.

91
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:20,092
The most orderly drug traffic.
More robberies than I care to mention.

92
00:14:20,223 --> 00:14:22,892
Broken store windows. Firebombings.

93
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:26,967
All within a six-square-block area
of Sutter and Belmont.

94
00:14:27,105 --> 00:14:31,517
I could qualify that as a riot.
This isn't a neighborhood, it's a war.

95
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:35,102
What are we doing about that,
Captain Sterns?

96
00:14:35,237 --> 00:14:37,313
We know it's gang-related.

97
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:42,324
We put more uniformed officers out,
more cars on patrol.

98
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:45,786
We increased our real effort 15 per cent.

99
00:14:45,915 --> 00:14:48,950
Tell us the results.

100
00:14:49,084 --> 00:14:53,212
Reported crime is up 11 per cent.

101
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:00,426
Let's you and I have a talk.

102
00:15:04,223 --> 00:15:06,974
Leave him with me.

103
00:15:08,978 --> 00:15:12,144
So, how you feeling, Kersey? Smoke?

104
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:17,558
Where have you been recently?

105
00:15:17,695 --> 00:15:20,648
In the country, having a rest.

106
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:25,027
You see, Kersey... I admire you.

107
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:29,531
I'm a real fan. Even kept a folder on you.

108
00:15:30,457 --> 00:15:33,126
Truth is, I hate creeps, too.

109
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:36,750
But I can't do much about it. I'm a cop.

110
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:41,422
But you... You shoot 'em, right?

111
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,718
I have a theory.

112
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:50,089
If I'm right,

113
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:53,096
you turned pro after LA.

114
00:15:53,229 --> 00:15:56,015
Six creeps shot in 36 hours.

115
00:15:57,816 --> 00:16:03,569
Then four gang members in Kansas City.
Two mugger-rapists in Chicago.

116
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:07,232
Like I said, I'm through with all that.

117
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,570
Really? Then why are you here?

118
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:14,404
Well, it's a great city. I missed it.

119
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,498
All right. You want something
in this burg, have it.

120
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:22,372
It's on me.

121
00:16:22,507 --> 00:16:25,293
You want outta here, you got it.

122
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:31,179
I'll minimize the vigilante stuff
with the press, say it's creeps killing creeps.

123
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:34,260
It'll be just like before, Mr. Vigilante.

124
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:40,098
With one important difference.
You're gonna work for me.

125
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:44,478
Do your thing. But report to me,
tell me what's going on.

126
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:49,320
Tell me everything you're even thinking
of doing. Let us get some busts.

127
00:16:49,448 --> 00:16:53,991
It's that or I'll keep you here
till hell freezes over.

128
00:16:55,163 --> 00:16:57,867
Do we understand each other?

129
00:16:59,374 --> 00:17:01,498
You in?

130
00:17:01,627 --> 00:17:06,585
Cross me and I'll bury you
so deep they'll never find the bones.

131
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:14,087
- You're letting me loose?
- I'm letting you loose.

132
00:17:19,811 --> 00:17:24,971
- What about the gun?
- I didn't see any report of a gun. Did you?

133
00:17:25,107 --> 00:17:30,232
If there was a gun, I'd have to charge you
with possessing a firearm. They're illegal.

134
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:38,365
He's free to go.
He's gotta see the public defender.

135
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:42,196
Davis, the public defender,
is arranging your release.

136
00:17:42,332 --> 00:17:45,582
It's gonna take a while.
Sit out there and wait.

137
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:54,425
Kimble... Watch it,
there's a new breed on the streets.

138
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:10,317
Quiet now. I'm not here.

139
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:19,943
Is this the night's haul, Chaco?
Pretty good. Very good.

140
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:23,866
- Good, Chaco.
- Hector, are you allowed?

141
00:18:23,997 --> 00:18:27,200
I'll tell you what to do and when.

142
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:33,128
We didn't think we'd see you out so soon.

143
00:18:37,886 --> 00:18:42,880
Hey, man, it's good to see you!
Just been taking care of a little business.

144
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:45,802
- I can see that.
- You said I should...

145
00:18:45,935 --> 00:18:47,726
Did I?

146
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:52,481
This is a sticker, Hector.

147
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:54,896
- And you're the stickee.
- No!

148
00:18:59,782 --> 00:19:03,316
Aren't you gonna welcome me back?

149
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:10,947
Mr. Kimble? Kathryn Davis,
Public Defender's Office.

150
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:14,916
- You're being released now.
- Thanks, Miss Davis.

151
00:19:16,214 --> 00:19:18,787
- You're just going to walk away?
- Yup.

152
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:23,716
- You have cause to press charges. Sue.
- Miss Davis, it's all right.

153
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:26,764
- You don't wanna do anything?
- No.

154
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:29,631
- I don't understand.
- Goodbye.

155
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:33,552
- Here's my number, just in case.
- Thanks.

156
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:39,229
Is there someplace I can get hold of you?
I need something for the release form.

157
00:20:26,989 --> 00:20:31,153
Bitch, come here, I wanna eat you.
I wanna lick you all over.

158
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:36,362
I'm coming for you, bitch.
Come here, I wanna eat you.

159
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:38,408
Come on, bitch.

160
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:42,287
Come on! Come on, bitch! Come on.

161
00:20:43,714 --> 00:20:47,296
Come on, stop the car. Come on, bitch!

162
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:49,419
Stop the car.

163
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:55,182
Bitch, I'm gonna fucking kill you!

164
00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:11,489
Hey!

165
00:21:11,616 --> 00:21:13,692
Be right down.

166
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:28,167
- Who are you?
- I was Charley's friend.

167
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:30,374
Me, too.

168
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:33,260
- You must be Paul.
- Yeah.

169
00:21:33,386 --> 00:21:37,466
I'm Bennett.
Charley spoke about you all the time.

170
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:41,466
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Come on up.

171
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,732
They broke that yesterday.
Well, it's the neighborhood.

172
00:21:50,862 --> 00:21:55,274
And you missed the funeral.
It was nice, as far as funerals go.

173
00:21:57,827 --> 00:22:01,575
That's Charley and me in World War II.

174
00:22:01,705 --> 00:22:05,454
I knew Charley 40 years.

175
00:22:06,752 --> 00:22:09,539
He met you during the Korean War?

176
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:13,835
Yeah. I was a conscientious objector.

177
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:19,012
He didn't agree with that.
But we got along all right.

178
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:22,223
In fact, we got to be very good friends.

179
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,644
Kept in touch with one another
over the years.

180
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:32,013
We lived a few blocks from here.
When my wife died, I moved over here.

181
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:35,983
This was a good neighborhood
until it changed.

182
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:41,154
I got a letter from Charley a few days ago.
He was really scared.

183
00:22:41,284 --> 00:22:46,409
- They didn't like him, so they killed him.
- Who killed Charley?

184
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:50,751
The creeps on the street.
He wouldn't take their lip or pay them.

185
00:22:50,877 --> 00:22:54,292
He said he was gonna
do something about it.

186
00:22:54,422 --> 00:22:57,173
Pay? Like in protection?

187
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,463
Protection, robbery, theft.
Your money or your life.

188
00:23:01,595 --> 00:23:04,347
They hit the old people up here.

189
00:23:04,473 --> 00:23:08,056
What goes on out there is a disgrace.

190
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:11,269
Now wait a minute. Who killed Charley?

191
00:23:11,396 --> 00:23:13,804
I'll show you.

192
00:23:13,941 --> 00:23:19,148
Those three. I saw them running away
when Charley got killed.

193
00:23:20,113 --> 00:23:24,905
- Their faces are painted.
- They belong to the same gang.

194
00:23:25,034 --> 00:23:28,902
We got hell here. You see, it's their turf.

195
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:33,206
- See him?
- Yeah.

196
00:23:33,334 --> 00:23:35,872
What about him?

197
00:23:36,004 --> 00:23:39,337
He runs the gang. He's the worst.

198
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:44,877
He's been away. I don't know where.

199
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,508
Looks like you could just go up
and smash him in the face, doesn't it?

200
00:23:51,644 --> 00:23:53,766
Well, it can't be done.

201
00:23:53,896 --> 00:23:56,221
What do you mean?

202
00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:01,526
He's got guys watching him.
I saw a guy try to reach him once.

203
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:05,271
They chopped him to pieces
before he got six feet.

204
00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:08,324
Is it worth living here like this?

205
00:24:08,451 --> 00:24:11,452
You mean move?

206
00:24:13,414 --> 00:24:16,036
Everybody who can, has.

207
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:19,333
Me, I got nowhere to go.

208
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:25,297
I fix clocks, meters for the cab company.
I got a little place down the street.

209
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:27,549
It's what I do.

210
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,297
I'm not gonna get run outta here.

211
00:24:34,351 --> 00:24:37,138
Are you going back where you came from?

212
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:43,439
Bennett... when I got to Charley's
apartment, he was still alive.

213
00:24:43,568 --> 00:24:47,400
- Did he say anything?
- Yeah, he said,

214
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:51,195
"Take care of my things until I get back."

215
00:24:53,536 --> 00:24:56,703
I've got the keys to his apartment.

216
00:24:56,831 --> 00:25:00,365
The rent is paid till the end of the month.

217
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:13,718
They've cleaned up and are through
with their investigation. Cops don't care.

218
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:18,885
- Well?
- Like you said, the rent's paid.

219
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,640
Good night. See you in the morning.

220
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:25,222
Lock your door.

221
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,753
Bitch, get over here now!

222
00:26:15,406 --> 00:26:17,943
The Giggler, that's his name.

223
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:22,024
He laughs when he runs.
Nobody catches him.

224
00:26:22,162 --> 00:26:26,076
- Jesus. He really moves.
- Yeah.

225
00:26:26,207 --> 00:26:28,877
Tell me about him.

226
00:26:29,002 --> 00:26:35,372
Well, he killed a girl last month.
Put a knife in her skull doing that.

227
00:26:35,508 --> 00:26:39,007
- How do you know it was him?
- It was him.

228
00:26:41,473 --> 00:26:46,632
Bennett said we can ask. Were you
downstairs last night in the garage?

229
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:48,975
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

230
00:26:49,105 --> 00:26:52,021
- For what?
- My wife, Maria.

231
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:55,185
- She was in the car. You helped her?
- Yeah.

232
00:26:55,319 --> 00:27:00,823
I'm Rodriguez. We live downstairs.
You were a friend of Charley's?

233
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:03,404
- Yeah.
- You're a man who doesn't run.

234
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:06,571
If there's anything I can do to help, huh?

235
00:27:06,705 --> 00:27:12,209
- What about the cops? They do anything?
- Yeah. They enforce the parking laws.

236
00:27:15,547 --> 00:27:17,373
Yes. Thank you.

237
00:27:17,506 --> 00:27:22,667
Well, my friend Wildey's coming.
He'll help out.

238
00:27:22,803 --> 00:27:25,045
- Who's Wildey?
- You'll see.

239
00:27:25,181 --> 00:27:27,387
Where are you going?

240
00:27:27,517 --> 00:27:31,680
You just take it easy, Bennett.
This is my problem.

241
00:27:42,447 --> 00:27:45,781
I'd like to rent a box for a month.

242
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:47,984
B21.

243
00:27:58,463 --> 00:28:01,796
OK, this is all right.

244
00:28:01,924 --> 00:28:05,542
- How are you gonna pay for it?
- Cash.

245
00:28:11,141 --> 00:28:16,728
- What's that for? The new car.
- That's bait.

246
00:28:18,356 --> 00:28:24,228
Coming through the lobby, I smelled
something cooking. It smelled great.

247
00:28:24,362 --> 00:28:27,529
It was probably coming from
the Kaprovs' apartment.

248
00:28:27,657 --> 00:28:31,275
- Kaprovs?
- Yeah. I'll introduce you. Come on.

249
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,159
These are the Kaprovs. This is Eli, Erica.

250
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:40,580
This is Mr. Kersey. He's now in apartment
2C. He was admiring your dinner.

251
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:43,914
- Stuffed cabbage.
- Smells wonderful.

252
00:28:44,048 --> 00:28:46,918
- Would you like to join us?
- Sure.

253
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:50,466
- Can I have a few minutes to clean up?
- Certainly.

254
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:52,920
I'll be right back.

255
00:28:55,142 --> 00:28:56,422
Nice man.

256
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:15,577
My sister said,
"Know him? I married him in 1931."

257
00:29:19,498 --> 00:29:22,949
Come on!
Let's get the fucking car open!

258
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,537
Excuse me, please.

259
00:29:43,729 --> 00:29:48,190
- Hey. What's the problem?
- What?

260
00:29:48,317 --> 00:29:53,228
- With the car. What's the problem?
- Get outta my fucking face.

261
00:29:53,364 --> 00:29:56,530
We're stealing a fucking car.
What's it to you?

262
00:29:56,658 --> 00:29:59,446
It's my car.

263
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:02,571
Now you gonna die.

264
00:30:12,424 --> 00:30:17,169
- We heard shots. What happened?
- I sent them a message.

265
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,941
- You're outta your area.
- This is our turf!

266
00:30:38,073 --> 00:30:40,031
Hurt him.

267
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:49,533
Kill him.

268
00:31:05,808 --> 00:31:11,728
Gentlemen, the streets are full
of degenerates killing each other.

269
00:31:11,855 --> 00:31:14,013
Arrest them.

270
00:31:14,858 --> 00:31:18,690
- Your guys aren't pussies, are they?
- Chief?

271
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,486
I want some arrests.
And bodies on slabs in the morgue.

272
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:27,573
They can be your guys' bodies
or some of that trash. Get that?

273
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:36,285
Hey. What the fuck are you looking at?

274
00:31:37,713 --> 00:31:40,750
Hey, lend me five dollars, man.

275
00:31:41,884 --> 00:31:45,419
Hey, I said lend me five dollars! Sucker!

276
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,884
- No!
- Hey!

277
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,227
Yeah! Right on, man!

278
00:32:04,363 --> 00:32:08,741
- You all right?
- Yeah. Thanks, huh? You all right?

279
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:12,401
Who is this man? We need him.

280
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:15,208
Emil, Mr. Kersey. Our new neighbor in 2C.

281
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:19,627
I'm very pleased to meet you.
Oh, this is my wife, Magda.

282
00:32:19,754 --> 00:32:23,454
- Nice to meet you.
- That's him. The man in black.

283
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:27,255
He's on my turf. I'll take care of him.

284
00:32:42,858 --> 00:32:46,310
- Yes?
- You Charley's friend? Guy in 2C?

285
00:32:46,445 --> 00:32:48,688
Yes.

286
00:32:48,823 --> 00:32:54,410
- What are you doing in there?
- I'm taking care of Charley's things.

287
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:59,661
Charley don't need no help.
He's dead. Just like you're gonna be.

288
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:02,543
I'm watching you.

289
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:10,689
- What do you think of the neighborhood?
- You said I was to be here on my own.

290
00:34:10,818 --> 00:34:14,021
You're right. I think I said that.

291
00:34:14,154 --> 00:34:16,727
Look... I'd like something.

292
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:21,032
For the papers. You give me a bust.

293
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:25,241
I'll send in a tactical squad,
they'll grab a headline.

294
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:28,327
- What do you say?
- Can't help you.

295
00:34:28,459 --> 00:34:32,042
- Nothing happening, huh?
- I don't know anything.

296
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:35,671
- Look, Kersey...
- Oh, I do know one thing.

297
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,094
Fraker is the chief creep here.
Why don't you bust him?

298
00:34:40,221 --> 00:34:44,301
He's got a cleaner arrest record than you.
Perfect citizen.

299
00:34:44,433 --> 00:34:47,684
When he does something,
he does it privately.

300
00:34:47,812 --> 00:34:51,015
Like I said, I can't help you.

301
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,532
Somebody's gonna get him.

302
00:35:13,669 --> 00:35:17,714
- Shit, man, I'm hurt.
- Son of a bitch!

303
00:35:18,257 --> 00:35:20,380
What is this, man?

304
00:35:20,509 --> 00:35:24,174
We gotta turn the screws
on the motherfuckers.

305
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:29,717
- Give me some money.
- What for?

306
00:35:29,852 --> 00:35:33,896
- Protection from the creeps.
- You're the creep!

307
00:35:34,022 --> 00:35:38,234
- Hey, you!
- Get out of my way! I've had enough.

308
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:56,372
- What are you doing up here?
- Looking for you.

309
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:58,958
How did you find me up here?

310
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:04,129
I decided if I waited to hear from you
I never would. Shriker was no help.

311
00:36:04,259 --> 00:36:08,886
I read the arrest report
and made a calculated guess.

312
00:36:09,014 --> 00:36:12,466
- I was right. You live there, don't you?
- Yeah.

313
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,895
Miss... Davis, I told you,
I'm not gonna file any charges.

314
00:36:17,022 --> 00:36:20,271
- Would you like to have dinner?
- What?

315
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,563
Well, I'm not usually this bold,

316
00:36:24,695 --> 00:36:29,938
taking a taxi to someplace someone
might not be, to ask them out, but...

317
00:36:30,075 --> 00:36:35,580
...why not? How many people do I meet
in my job who I can ask out to dinner?

318
00:36:35,706 --> 00:36:40,830
- You shouldn't be up here. It's not safe.
- Nonsense, I'm a city girl.

319
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:46,750
Do me a favor. Say yes. So I can
get out of here without being mugged.

320
00:36:47,843 --> 00:36:50,001
OK, all right. When?

321
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,384
- Friday?
- Friday? Friday's good for me.

322
00:36:56,476 --> 00:36:58,682
My place.

323
00:36:59,813 --> 00:37:04,356
I live in a basement.
It's a nice basement.

324
00:37:04,484 --> 00:37:08,861
- What are you doing up here?
- Friend of mine was killed.

325
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:13,982
- Trying to find out what happened.
- Why? There's nothing you can do.

326
00:37:14,744 --> 00:37:17,863
I'll put it in a book I'm writing.

327
00:37:17,997 --> 00:37:21,200
Look, your meter's running.
I'll see you Friday.

328
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:24,038
Friday. Thank you.

329
00:38:00,871 --> 00:38:05,616
- You were brandishing a gun.
- What do you mean, "brandishing"?

330
00:38:06,543 --> 00:38:10,540
Some kids tried to come in
my back window. I waved it.

331
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:13,423
The complaints said you brandished it.

332
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:18,176
- Complaints? Who?
- That's none of your concern, sir.

333
00:38:19,305 --> 00:38:23,349
Can we have the gun?
Possession is a felony in the city limits.

334
00:38:23,476 --> 00:38:26,809
If you surrender the weapon,
we'll forget it happened.

335
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,891
Otherwise, you go to jail.

336
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:35,104
Eli, give him the gun.

337
00:38:35,237 --> 00:38:39,317
- Erica, it's our protection.
- Please.

338
00:38:42,952 --> 00:38:44,826
Thanks, mister.

339
00:38:55,673 --> 00:38:59,042
Listen, we'll come in here any time we like.

340
00:38:59,176 --> 00:39:01,465
You got that... Pops?

341
00:39:03,722 --> 00:39:05,964
Any time!

342
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,811
The first floor is the worst.

343
00:39:14,942 --> 00:39:18,808
But they come in wherever they want
from the fire escapes.

344
00:39:18,945 --> 00:39:23,406
It's 90 degrees outside.
And I've had my windows nailed shut.

345
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:27,234
I'll take care of it.
But I'll need some things first.

346
00:39:43,636 --> 00:39:45,711
This is how it works.

347
00:39:45,846 --> 00:39:48,681
I've put a nail in the window.

348
00:39:48,807 --> 00:39:52,591
Anybody opening the window
raises the nail...

349
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:04,855
- What are you doing?
- Thinning the herd.

350
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:12,277
Hey... I wanna make a house call, man.

351
00:40:13,372 --> 00:40:16,575
I'm a little short on cash.

352
00:40:16,709 --> 00:40:21,584
For 20 minutes you play.
Then you all go out to work.

353
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:25,839
- All right! Get up! Go!
- Come on!

354
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:29,836
- Mr. Bennett, I know you like a lot.
- Yes, I do.

355
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:50,694
- What are those?
- Teeth.

356
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:53,316
APB, theft at 121 Sutter.

357
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:58,494
Suspect is described as Latino,
five foot six. Missing two front teeth.

358
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:18,093
You thief! Stop!

359
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,401
This Wildey friend of yours,
can he catch this guy?

360
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:42,700
- Well, who's Wildey?
- You'll see.

361
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:02,262
Wildey's here.

362
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:16,071
Fires a.475 Wildey Magnum.
Real stopping power.

363
00:42:16,198 --> 00:42:18,819
Is that like a.44 Magnum?

364
00:42:18,951 --> 00:42:21,738
No, a.44 Magnum is a pistol cartridge.

365
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:28,453
A.475 Wildey Magnum is a shorter version
of the African big-game cartridge.

366
00:42:29,753 --> 00:42:32,457
Makes a real mess.

367
00:42:52,191 --> 00:42:55,144
Yeah!

368
00:43:00,574 --> 00:43:06,492
What are you two looking at? What are you,
perverts? Get the fuck outta here!

369
00:43:10,917 --> 00:43:14,119
Open the door!

370
00:43:15,004 --> 00:43:18,503
All right, open the door!

371
00:43:18,633 --> 00:43:20,708
OK.

372
00:43:20,843 --> 00:43:25,470
- No! No!
- Let's go! Come on!

373
00:44:06,804 --> 00:44:10,173
Raped her. They raped her!

374
00:44:10,891 --> 00:44:13,097
Bennett, get a taxi.

375
00:44:14,936 --> 00:44:18,221
- Oh, Maria...
- Thanks.

376
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:20,681
They say she'll be all right.

377
00:44:20,817 --> 00:44:24,684
Just a broken arm.
I'll take you to the hospital.

378
00:44:28,241 --> 00:44:31,027
It'll all be all right.

379
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,698
Baptist Medical Centre.

380
00:44:36,123 --> 00:44:39,408
Dr. Applebaum
to the Emergency Room.

381
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:44,333
The doctor is in here.

382
00:44:44,464 --> 00:44:49,506
- Mr. Rodriguez?
- How's my wife? Can I see her?

383
00:44:50,596 --> 00:44:53,382
Mrs. Rodriguez has expired.

384
00:44:59,604 --> 00:45:04,645
Jesus. Over the phone they told me
she had just a broken arm.

385
00:45:04,775 --> 00:45:09,069
The arm was badly injured.
There were broken blood vessels.

386
00:45:09,196 --> 00:45:13,526
Some clots came free and, we think,
lodged in the heart.

387
00:45:16,578 --> 00:45:18,654
I'm sorry.

388
00:45:30,717 --> 00:45:36,007
The light's no good. No ID you make
is gonna stand up in a court.

389
00:46:02,205 --> 00:46:07,330
- You load the shells yourself?
- Nothing's too good for our friends.

390
00:46:08,086 --> 00:46:11,206
The action of this weapon is adjustable.

391
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:14,458
Depending on the charge and the cartridge.

392
00:46:15,385 --> 00:46:19,548
Think I'll go down the street
and get myself some ice cream.

393
00:46:25,394 --> 00:46:27,932
This is America, isn't it?

394
00:46:54,255 --> 00:46:56,331
Thanks!

395
00:47:01,011 --> 00:47:03,088
What do I owe you?

396
00:47:14,775 --> 00:47:17,692
Look at that fucker with the ice cream.

397
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,586
Somebody got shot. Who was that man?

398
00:47:45,721 --> 00:47:49,421
Oh, my... It's the creep
that stole my pocketbook!

399
00:47:49,558 --> 00:47:53,686
- All right! All right!
- He's dead! Hey!

400
00:48:03,446 --> 00:48:06,150
Right on! Right on!

401
00:48:08,409 --> 00:48:11,743
They killed The Giggler, man.

402
00:48:11,871 --> 00:48:14,278
They killed The Giggler!

403
00:48:14,415 --> 00:48:18,033
They had no business doing that. None.

404
00:48:18,169 --> 00:48:21,288
It's the new man, the one from the jail.

405
00:48:22,673 --> 00:48:26,124
That wasn't smart. No, not too smart.

406
00:48:27,886 --> 00:48:31,338
Come on, you all, let's move it back.
Make way.

407
00:48:38,605 --> 00:48:42,519
Where you been? It's about time.
I'm glad he's dead!

408
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:46,897
He took my pocketbook three weeks ago!
I'm glad he's dead!

409
00:48:47,029 --> 00:48:49,105
Cops never get here on time!

410
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,316
- Hi, team.
- Hello, Chief.

411
00:48:51,451 --> 00:48:54,237
What have you got here?

412
00:48:55,329 --> 00:48:58,780
There's not much left
of the sucker, is there?

413
00:49:00,751 --> 00:49:05,163
- How are things around here?
- Better. It's getting quiet.

414
00:49:05,297 --> 00:49:08,417
Our efforts must be having a positive effect.

415
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:12,797
- We're getting fewer complaints.
- Don't let it go to your head.

416
00:49:12,929 --> 00:49:17,057
Looked like a rifle bullet.
The shot came from over there.

417
00:49:17,183 --> 00:49:21,430
- He was a good shot.
- Better than anyone in our department.

418
00:49:27,068 --> 00:49:28,941
- Hello.
- Hello.

419
00:49:31,989 --> 00:49:35,108
The guy at the store said this wine is good.

420
00:49:35,242 --> 00:49:37,484
Great. I'll open it.

421
00:49:38,245 --> 00:49:41,945
I hope you like chicken.
It's the only thing I can make.

422
00:49:42,082 --> 00:49:44,573
Chicken's good. I like chicken.

423
00:49:49,506 --> 00:49:53,337
I have one sister.
She lives in Binghamton, New York.

424
00:49:53,468 --> 00:49:55,923
And I hate her.

425
00:49:56,053 --> 00:50:00,051
But I love sports.
Basketball and football on TV.

426
00:50:00,183 --> 00:50:03,433
- What do you like?
- I like opera.

427
00:50:04,311 --> 00:50:07,348
- Opera?
- It's restful.

428
00:50:08,482 --> 00:50:11,187
I don't know anything about you.

429
00:50:11,318 --> 00:50:14,235
Married? Children?

430
00:50:14,363 --> 00:50:18,656
- I was married, but my wife died.
- I'm sorry.

431
00:50:20,494 --> 00:50:24,657
It's all right. That was years ago.
What about you?

432
00:50:25,707 --> 00:50:31,827
Am I right? I guess that you're afraid
to be close to someone again.

433
00:50:31,963 --> 00:50:34,418
Oh... maybe.

434
00:50:36,925 --> 00:50:40,342
Do you like the kind of work you do?

435
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:43,092
Most of the time.

436
00:50:43,224 --> 00:50:47,268
No. Sometimes I feel like
I'm on the wrong side.

437
00:50:48,061 --> 00:50:51,146
Defending... creeps.

438
00:50:52,732 --> 00:50:55,223
Don't take that personally.

439
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:01,529
You're gentle. But I've seen
a lot of gentle people get hurt.

440
00:51:02,408 --> 00:51:07,829
People have got to fight back, and hard!
The whole thing is just out of balance.

441
00:51:09,207 --> 00:51:12,492
Some people would say
that was an extreme position.

442
00:51:12,627 --> 00:51:16,209
I don't care! I bet you never get mad.

443
00:51:18,174 --> 00:51:21,922
I'm sorry. Why am I angry at you?

444
00:51:24,346 --> 00:51:29,340
Tell me. You don't really like opera, do you?

445
00:51:30,811 --> 00:51:33,017
No.

446
00:51:34,689 --> 00:51:38,473
- It's late. I gotta go.
- No, it's early.

447
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:42,821
Even an unemployed writer has to work.
I really gotta go.

448
00:51:45,491 --> 00:51:48,279
- Well, see you again?
- Yup.

449
00:51:57,169 --> 00:51:59,707
Cuban's gonna get high.

450
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:04,040
Go ahead, it's speed.

451
00:52:06,095 --> 00:52:09,179
Yeah, Cuban's gonna get high! High! High!

452
00:52:09,306 --> 00:52:13,433
- No needles, man.
- Just snort it.

453
00:52:14,353 --> 00:52:17,388
I don't want you flat on your ass.

454
00:52:17,522 --> 00:52:19,929
Cuban's gonna kill tonight.

455
00:53:38,724 --> 00:53:41,476
Head him off. Get round back.

456
00:55:13,273 --> 00:55:15,349
He's all yours. Go get him.

457
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:43,978
Police car to Control.
Request ambulance to 763 Belmont.

458
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:46,275
We have a dead body out front.

459
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:49,855
Send the meat wagon to 673 Belmont.

460
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,903
Let's talk.

461
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:04,037
Try and take it easy
for a couple of days, will you?

462
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:13,380
Coroner's shop
is going out and hiring extra help.

463
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:18,008
People are starting to get a line on you.

464
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:22,558
He isn't finished. It isn't finished.

465
00:57:22,688 --> 00:57:27,017
It's like killing roaches.
You have to kill them all.

466
00:57:32,281 --> 00:57:36,325
- Hi. Is this Mr. Emil?
- Yes. Yes.

467
00:57:36,451 --> 00:57:41,030
I think your wife needs your help.
She's sick or something.

468
00:57:41,164 --> 00:57:46,407
- Who is this? What do you mean?
- Hey, you be nice now.

469
00:57:46,545 --> 00:57:50,245
- You better be here, at home.
- Who is this?

470
00:57:50,382 --> 00:57:53,833
You threw one of my boys
outta your store last week.

471
00:57:53,968 --> 00:57:56,340
It's your wife. She's dying.

472
00:58:26,916 --> 00:58:30,285
- Hello?
- See what you've done? You got me mad.

473
00:58:31,129 --> 00:58:33,370
Fuck it.

474
00:58:33,506 --> 00:58:37,967
It's me he wants, you know. How's Emil?

475
00:58:38,094 --> 00:58:41,676
Forget Emil. Emil's done for.

476
00:58:41,806 --> 00:58:45,009
He'll never be the same again.

477
00:58:45,142 --> 00:58:52,188
20 years, nobody ever did a thing
like that to me. Breaking my windows.

478
00:58:52,316 --> 00:58:55,186
Well, I say fuck 'em. I've had it.

479
00:58:55,319 --> 00:58:58,438
Charley said the same thing
and he was right.

480
00:58:58,571 --> 00:59:02,651
He was afraid he was gonna use them.
He should have.

481
00:59:02,784 --> 00:59:05,489
Instead, he gave them to me to keep.

482
00:59:05,619 --> 00:59:09,617
Next time they come,
I've got something for them.

483
00:59:09,749 --> 00:59:12,240
- What?
- I'll show you.

484
00:59:19,758 --> 00:59:22,214
A.30-calibre Browning machine gun.

485
00:59:22,345 --> 00:59:26,045
Charley brought them home from the war.
They still work.

486
00:59:26,181 --> 00:59:28,672
Jesus!

487
00:59:31,311 --> 00:59:33,980
- This ammunition any good?
- Damn right.

488
00:59:34,105 --> 00:59:38,566
You shoot some nice, big holes
in the sons of bitches.

489
00:59:38,693 --> 00:59:43,604
They call us the old people.
We were running the world 20 years ago.

490
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:49,078
- What do you say?
- No. A lot of people could get hurt.

491
00:59:52,498 --> 00:59:55,452
It's me he wants.

492
00:59:55,585 --> 00:59:58,704
This is his turf. If I leave, he wins.

493
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:04,625
- You want that?
- Maybe it'll save people from getting killed.

494
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:08,627
- Do me a favor, Bennett.
- Name it.

495
01:00:08,763 --> 01:00:11,052
Don't use those guns.

496
01:00:11,182 --> 01:00:13,970
Give me a day to get Fraker.

497
01:00:14,102 --> 01:00:16,973
Whatever you say. I was just trying to help.

498
01:00:45,048 --> 01:00:48,916
Hi. Well, you said it was important.

499
01:00:49,051 --> 01:00:51,625
Thanks for coming. Come on in.

500
01:00:51,763 --> 01:00:54,929
- I'm leaving the city.
- What?

501
01:00:55,934 --> 01:01:03,181
A couple of weeks with my sister. And
I'll do whatever I have to not to be here.

502
01:01:03,315 --> 01:01:08,226
Oh, it's everything.
This place, my job, people I deal with.

503
01:01:11,866 --> 01:01:15,235
I just wanted to see you one more time.

504
01:01:15,368 --> 01:01:19,069
I didn't think you wanted to leave this city.

505
01:01:33,011 --> 01:01:37,174
Do you still think
you don't want to get close to someone?

506
01:01:40,976 --> 01:01:47,061
You know, my wife didn't just die,
she was murdered.

507
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:51,402
They never caught the people that did it.

508
01:01:51,528 --> 01:01:54,019
And my daughter.

509
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,778
Anyway, something in me changed.

510
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:00,578
Does it have to be that way forever?

511
01:02:01,329 --> 01:02:03,405
No.

512
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:09,830
Why don't you come with me? At least visit.
You don't have to be here.

513
01:02:09,963 --> 01:02:13,794
- I could do that.
- I bet you want to leave.

514
01:02:13,925 --> 01:02:17,258
- All you need is an excuse.
- I'll bet you're right.

515
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:22,134
I'm hungry. How about you?

516
01:02:22,266 --> 01:02:25,386
I'm starved. I know a good restaurant.

517
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:28,769
- Is it open late?
- They sure are.

518
01:02:33,693 --> 01:02:36,101
Here he is. They're going.

519
01:02:46,581 --> 01:02:48,538
Don't lose them.

520
01:03:06,058 --> 01:03:09,059
Be right back. I'm gonna pick up my mail.

521
01:03:09,186 --> 01:03:12,021
I'll be right here.

522
01:03:34,084 --> 01:03:36,160
Come on!

523
01:04:03,487 --> 01:04:06,025
Somebody call the ambulance!

524
01:04:21,546 --> 01:04:26,007
People are looking for you up there,
where you shot the punk.

525
01:04:26,134 --> 01:04:29,966
They have a description.
You were eating an ice cream.

526
01:04:30,096 --> 01:04:34,675
So you better take it easy for a few days,
for your own damn good.

527
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:40,183
- I have places I'm supposed to be.
- That's why you're not gonna be there.

528
01:04:50,116 --> 01:04:54,065
When he comes out,
take him into protective custody.

529
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:05,332
- Come on, pal, you're coming with us.
- Come on, mister, let's move it.

530
01:05:07,674 --> 01:05:10,509
Come on, mister, get in the car.

531
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:19,674
That's my shop!

532
01:05:28,402 --> 01:05:30,145
My shop! My shop!

533
01:05:32,198 --> 01:05:35,114
Come on, stay back! Stay back!

534
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:38,618
My shop!

535
01:05:40,664 --> 01:05:43,237
My shop!

536
01:05:44,751 --> 01:05:46,910
Kersey! Kersey!

537
01:05:56,387 --> 01:06:00,847
I'll give you something to screech about,
you sons of bitches!

538
01:06:12,611 --> 01:06:16,228
Kersey, goddamn you! Goddamn you.

539
01:06:16,364 --> 01:06:19,484
Where is he? He's not where he should be.

540
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:31,495
He's got a gun!

541
01:06:34,048 --> 01:06:37,997
It's not working!
Kill the motherfucker! Kill him!

542
01:07:08,081 --> 01:07:11,414
Man, can you hear me? Oh, my God!

543
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:21,210
You wanna tell Shriker
I'd like to talk to him?

544
01:07:21,343 --> 01:07:25,804
Well, he don't wanna talk to you.
He told me so. Personally.

545
01:07:27,099 --> 01:07:32,603
A man's been beaten. He'll identify
his assailants, but only if he talks to you.

546
01:07:32,729 --> 01:07:35,979
Bennett Cross.
He was armed with a machine gun.

547
01:07:37,275 --> 01:07:40,311
Dr. Hernandez, please call your office.

548
01:07:40,444 --> 01:07:42,603
Thank you, nurse.

549
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:46,609
- How is he?
- Well, he's a tough bird.

550
01:07:46,742 --> 01:07:50,325
A couple of bad fractures
but I think he'll make it.

551
01:07:50,454 --> 01:07:53,621
Can I go in and see him?

552
01:07:53,749 --> 01:07:55,825
OK?

553
01:07:59,421 --> 01:08:03,999
- I screwed up. I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

554
01:08:04,968 --> 01:08:11,007
Listen, Kersey...
I only lost one gun for you there.

555
01:08:11,725 --> 01:08:14,928
The other one's still there,
in the same place.

556
01:08:15,645 --> 01:08:18,397
Blow the scum away.

557
01:08:21,442 --> 01:08:25,771
Dr. Davies, telephone please.

558
01:08:35,122 --> 01:08:37,363
He had to go someplace.

559
01:08:45,549 --> 01:08:47,624
Taxi!

560
01:09:46,065 --> 01:09:49,185
- You wanna take this?
- I saw you come in.

561
01:09:49,317 --> 01:09:51,939
Used to be Charley's.

562
01:10:08,795 --> 01:10:13,622
He's back. He picked up some packages
and he's back at the apartment.

563
01:10:13,758 --> 01:10:15,834
Move.

564
01:10:18,762 --> 01:10:23,970
Manny Fraker. I need some more guys.
As many as you can spare.

565
01:10:24,101 --> 01:10:25,512
Yeah. Thanks.

566
01:10:36,446 --> 01:10:39,815
- What is it?
- It's a Lars missile launcher.

567
01:10:39,949 --> 01:10:42,986
Anti-tank, anti-personnel weapon.

568
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:48,575
And these rounds
are self-propelled, armor-piercing.

569
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:52,626
The arm is three feet out of the barrel.

570
01:10:52,753 --> 01:10:56,502
Won't do me much good,
unless I can get 'em bunched.

571
01:10:56,632 --> 01:10:59,004
All I got is a zip gun.

572
01:11:04,806 --> 01:11:06,929
We should get a few of them.

573
01:11:07,058 --> 01:11:09,549
All right!

574
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:16,073
Eli! It's Mr. Kersey!
He just shot some of the creeps!

575
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:00,290
Who the hell's firing, man?
You told someone to fire?

576
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:19,596
Come on!

577
01:13:30,487 --> 01:13:33,903
Come on, you guys.
We're gonna get those motherfuckers!

578
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:21,273
We're out of ammo!

579
01:14:24,497 --> 01:14:28,958
Air unit six to base.
Around Sutter and Belmont,

580
01:14:29,085 --> 01:14:34,423
I've sighted buildings burning. Shots fired
in the street. Looks like we have a riot.

581
01:14:34,548 --> 01:14:36,920
We need every backup unit available.

582
01:14:37,634 --> 01:14:39,711
There! There!

583
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:11,672
...more money, said the mayor.

584
01:16:11,808 --> 01:16:14,974
News is coming in
of riots in East New York.

585
01:16:15,102 --> 01:16:20,690
- I can't see anything.
- Come here. Watch it on television.

586
01:16:20,816 --> 01:16:24,648
Police are converging there.
Our helicopter is overhead

587
01:16:24,778 --> 01:16:28,444
with Roy Baxter to bring you
an on-the-spot report.

588
01:16:28,574 --> 01:16:31,859
- Have you seen the man?
- I haven't seen shit, man!

589
01:16:31,994 --> 01:16:35,742
Throughout this vast area
of derelict buildings...

590
01:16:35,873 --> 01:16:38,079
We're on TV, man!

591
01:16:38,208 --> 01:16:41,494
...groups run and hide in alleys
and apartment buildings.

592
01:16:41,627 --> 01:16:45,957
There are great sheets of flames
rising from burning buildings.

593
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:50,551
The buildings are collapsing.
I can see fires over 20 blocks.

594
01:16:50,678 --> 01:16:56,134
Police cars are fighting a hail of bullets
as they try to get into the area.

595
01:16:56,267 --> 01:17:00,016
There are gangs of motorcyclists
down there,

596
01:17:00,146 --> 01:17:05,732
flanked by gunfire and flames
and smoke. It's a hell of a mess here.

597
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:12,360
We'll be back with news as soon
as we can find out what caused this.

598
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:35,602
Oh, boy!

599
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,065
Get him!

600
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,916
Kersey, look out!

601
01:21:34,157 --> 01:21:37,277
I'm out of shells. I'll go get some.

602
01:21:58,014 --> 01:22:00,551
I owed you that one, dude!

603
01:22:45,892 --> 01:22:49,261
Please!

604
01:24:57,519 --> 01:25:00,685
Well, now I owe you. How bad is it?

605
01:25:00,813 --> 01:25:03,434
It's just a nick.

606
01:25:03,566 --> 01:25:05,973
I'll call an ambulance.

607
01:25:14,867 --> 01:25:16,907
Hey.

608
01:25:18,621 --> 01:25:20,947
Bulletproof, asshole.

609
01:25:21,499 --> 01:25:23,990
Just like yours. Stay like that.

610
01:25:24,127 --> 01:25:27,045
- You can't have both of us.
- Bet me.

611
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:52,230
- Jesus Christ!
- What did that?

612
01:26:15,092 --> 01:26:19,422
Over at Belmont and Sutter
the crowd is breaking up.

613
01:26:20,097 --> 01:26:22,801
You better get going.

614
01:26:26,519 --> 01:26:29,093
I'll buy you a few minutes.

615
01:26:30,732 --> 01:26:34,147
Get outta here. They'll be after you.

616
