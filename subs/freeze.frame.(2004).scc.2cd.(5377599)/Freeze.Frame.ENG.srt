2
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,240
Fuck!

3
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,320
Oh, fuck!

4
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,000
30 seconds to tape depletion.

5
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,720
25 seconds to tape depletion.

6
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,440
20 seconds to tape depletion.

7
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,640
Oh, no, no. No!

8
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,720
15 seconds to tape depletion.

9
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,800
10 seconds to tape depletion.

10
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,240
Tape will deplete in
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

11
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,920
Fuck!

12
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,600
Oh, damn!

13
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,600
24 hours in a day.

14
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,120
1,440 separate minutes
in which someone...

15
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,800
could meet their end
at the hands of someone who may

16
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,200
or may not look like me.

17
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,240
86,400 seconds...

18
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,120
in each and every one of which someone
could breathe their last.

19
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,520
All that time to be accounted for.

20
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,760
All 31,536,000 separate seconds
of life...

21
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,600
and death each and every year.

22
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,440
Monday the 13th of October, 2003.

23
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,160
First nine hours covered.

24
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,320
Will today be the day?

25
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,240
Things to remember. One.

26
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,600
Paranoia is a malfunction of
the ability to reason.

27
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,320
I can reason...
therefore I am not paranoid.

28
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,520
Things to remember. Two.

29
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,840
The principle characteristics of
the paranoid personality are delusions...

30
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,520
hostility, suspicions...

31
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,400
I am not deluded.

32
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,120
I am not suspicious.

33
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,320
I may be hostile, but that's only
because they are out to get me.

34
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,440
April the 18th, 1994.

35
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,440
Chaos erupted at
the high court today...

36
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,560
following the sensational collapse of
the trial against

37
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,920
alleged triple murderer, Sean Veil.

38
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,120
Citing a pre-trial barrage of biased
media reports...

39
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,920
as being prejudicial
to Mr. Veil's defense...

40
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,000
Lord Justice Gaghan threw
the case out

41
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,840
and lambasted those in charge
of the investigation...

42
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,440
Detective Inspector Louis Emeric and
criminal profiler Saul Seger...

43
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,920
for contriving
an investigative strategy...

44
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,120
that essentially amounted to
trial-by-tabloid.

45
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,520
What happened in the High Court today
was a tragedy.

46
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,400
For the Jasper family
justice has not been done.

47
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,600
Nor has it been seen to be done.

48
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,840
In the wake of this outcome...

49
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,520
and I stress the word outcome
not verdict...

50
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,320
I think it's important to remember
that the accused

51
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,240
was not cleared of this crime...

52
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,520
and that, while the file on the Jasper
murders will remain open...

53
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,440
the police are not currently looking for
anyone else in connection with it.

54
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,520
Thank you.

55
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,440
Excuse me.

56
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,040
I would just like to add...

57
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,600
that the pathology of the Jasper murders
suggests...

58
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,800
that the killer is highly likely to
strike again.

59
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,920
If and when he does, which I for one
predict he will...

60
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,920
let me take this opportunity to assure
him categorically...

61
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,240
that there will be no escape from
justice...

62
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,720
a second time.

63
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,840
Nine years, 11 months...

64
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,720
28 days...

65
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,200
and 1,553 murders since.

66
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,640
975 still unsolved.

67
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,720
How many more have they thought about
pinning on me?

68
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,320
Lindsey Martell?
Jacqueline Jones?

69
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,120
The Bolton Baby?

70
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,320
975 murders unsolved.

71
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,720
1,615 children without mothers.

72
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,040
10,323 brothers, sisters
friends and relatives all bereaved.

73
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,360
All thinking that maybe it was me.

74
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,720
Probing the psyche of sexual
predators...

75
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,920
of those who rob, rape, torture and
kill...

76
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,120
to exert their superiority...

77
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,720
over a world they are
otherwise unable to affect...

78
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,840
is not a job for the faint of heart.

79
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,840
You have to see how the killer sees...

80
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,600
think how he thinks.

81
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,720
In a very real sense
you have to enter his mind...

82
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,920
and become the killer.

83
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,520
In this country alone

84
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,920
there are some 600
such predators out there...

85
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,440
who have thus far escaped justice.

86
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,920
These men, and by far
the majority of them are men...

87
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,040
are living and working among us.

88
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,240
Expert at presenting a benign
and unthreatening face...

89
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,800
to the world they secretly loathe.

90
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,520
They are the husbands, fathers
sons and friends...

91
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,400
of ordinary working people.

92
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:09,720
Indeed, some could be sitting
among us here, today.

93
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,840
This book will help you recognize
the hidden signs...

94
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,960
that point to the darkness invisible...

95
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,000
in the hearts of Britain's
uncaught killers.

96
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,120
Killers who could be lying next to you
in bed at night...

97
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,320
dreaming of the time...

98
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,840
when they will strike again.

99
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,920
Thank you.

100
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,640
Thank you, thank you very much.

101
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,320
Thank you.

102
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,120
Thank you very much.
Now I'm happy to take a few questions.

103
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,520
Yes.

104
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,920
Mr. Seger, my name's Katie Carter.
I'm a reporter from Crime Wave.

105
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,040
I know who you are, Miss Carter.

106
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,320
I heard on the radio this morning
that your book's

107
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,400
being published to coincide
with the tenth anniversary of the murder...

108
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,520
the barbaric slaughter I should say
of Susan Jasper and her daughters.

109
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,440
Yet nowhere within it do you advance any new theories

110
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,520
as to who the suspect might be
or how he might be brought to justice.

111
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,520
There's a good reason for that
Miss Carter.

112
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,640
My book is about the uncaught
killers of unsolved crimes.

113
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,640
Yes.

114
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,320
But, I don't consider
the Jasper murders to be unsolved.

115
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,920
But you're saying you know
who the killer is.

116
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,720
I am saying that I stand by the opinion
I formed 10 years ago.

117
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,520
I am further saying
that the type of man...

118
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,520
who can turn a gun on a pair
of six-year-old twin girls

119
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,640
never mind their parents

120
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,320
is someone the public will always be
at risk from until

121
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,040
they're under lock and key
or six feet of earth.

122
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,920
In that case, Mr. Seger
would you accept

123
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,560
that it's your fault
he's out on the streets?

124
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,720
I beg your pardon!

125
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,640
If you hadn't attempted to entrap
Sean Veil into confessing

126
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,560
the trial against him would not
have collapsed.

127
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,520
The libel laws of this country

128
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,200
forbid me from openly expressing
my views on this case, young lady.

129
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,920
However, what I will say is this...

130
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,120
I remain confident

131
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,440
that time will prove me right on
the Jasper case...

132
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,520
as it has on so many others.

133
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,240
Now, if you don't mind

134
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,640
there are plenty of other people here
who would like to ask me some questions.

135
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,720
- I have a question!
- Call Security now!

136
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,520
How does an innocent man
get justice in this country?

137
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,120
How does he get his reputation back?

138
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,920
His sanity?

139
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,240
- Is this some kind of setup?
- You ought to know, Seger!

140
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,320
Your field of expertise, isn't it?

141
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,320
My field of expertise, as you, sir
know only too well...

142
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,520
lies in the accurate identification
of murder suspects...

143
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,920
from the painstaking analysis
of crime scene information.

144
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,720
The identification of suckers, you mean.

145
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,800
- Dupes, dupes!
- You were there, Veil!

146
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,520
You were in the vicinity!
You were seen.

147
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,640
I was out walking.
I wasn't doing anyone any harm.

148
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,600
I did nothing wrong.

149
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,320
I'm an innocent man!

150
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,040
I am an innocent man!
I did nothing wrong!

151
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,920
Shout it loudly enough, Veil
someone might believe you. Not me!

152
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,840
I know different.
I'm in there, Veil.

153
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,840
I'm inside your mind.

154
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,840
I know all the perverted fantasies
you harbor.

155
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,040
The dark dreams. I know you
better than you know yourself!

156
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,360
No! You leave me alone!

157
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,200
The Jasper killer is still out there!
I did nothing wrong!

158
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,920
Seger! You know that!

159
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,120
I suppose I ought to thank you, Miss Carter
for all the free publicity.

160
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,200
You're throwing out the wrong man!
I'm not the criminal here!

161
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,040
I'm not the one making
money out of murder!

162
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,640
You're the one getting jailed for real
if you come back!

163
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,840
Mr. Veil, I heard what you said up there.

164
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,040
Mr. Veil, I heard what you said up there.

165
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,160
- Is he recording this?
- Yes, but I can get him to turn it off.

166
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,760
- No! No!
- Really I don't mind.

167
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,760
I'm perfectly happy to talk off-camera.

168
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,720
Off-camera? So I have no evidence?
No alibi?

169
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,000
Nothing to prove where
I was at 3:30 this afternoon?

170
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,640
So I can be accused of something

171
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,640
someone else is doing
somewhere else right now?

172
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,920
No! No. I meant, please...
whatever suits you best.

173
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,840
I was just wondering
if I could have a quick word.

174
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,720
I don't give interviews.

175
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,040
Not without editorial control.

176
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,840
Words can be distorted, re-edited.

177
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,640
Things can be made to seem other
than what they are.

178
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,840
It wasn't an interview I had in mind, Mr. Veil.
Not in the conventional sense.

179
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,640
I've got to go.

180
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,520
Mr. Veil, wait, please!

181
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,400
Shit.

182
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,800
Things to remember. Three.

183
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,040
It's everywhere.

184
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,240
All around me. The threat.

185
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,840
Once you feel it, you never lose it.

186
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,520
They make sure of that.

187
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:20,120
It's a war of nerves. Constant.
Ongoing. Never-ending.

188
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,120
How can they think I'm a criminal...

189
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,520
when I spend my life ensuring
I'm seen?

190
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,040
When I seek out what others avoid?

191
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,920
When even my appearance is designed
to stick in people's minds?

192
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,320
If I could... I'd live here.

193
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,120
Set up home right on this spot
to be surveilled constantly.

194
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,040
To have my whereabouts known
to all and sundry.

195
00:21:53,560 --> 00:22:00,720
The facts verifiable
undisputable, would be heaven.

196
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,840
Who's there?

197
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,240
I know there's someone there.

198
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,120
- You followed me.
- I've been waiting for you.

199
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,640
Where's your cameraman?

200
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,160
I sent him home hours ago
but I can always get him back.

201
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,720
No. I've already told you
my policy on interviews.

202
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,000
What about your policy
on reconstructions?

203
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,200
You're reconstructing
the Jasper murders.

204
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,520
Advance copy.

205
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,120
Due for transmission on the night
of the anniversary.

206
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,320
I thought you might like to take
a look at it.

207
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,520
So I can see myself being
stitched up again? Framed?

208
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,320
It's not that kind of reconstruction
Mr. Veil. Honestly.

209
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,600
- What other kind is there?
- Take a look and find out.

210
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,200
Am I in it?

211
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,600
- You're mentioned.
- But nobody's playing me?

212
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,200
- Brad Pitt was unavailable.
- What?

213
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,240
- Joke.
- I don't have time for this!

214
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,240
Fuck!

215
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,320
What I'm saying, Mr Veil
what I'm offering

216
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,720
is the chance for you
to play yourself!

217
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,520
No one likes to see an innocent man
entrapped by the police!

218
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,200
That's what I was.

219
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,000
What I am.

220
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,120
We could reconstruct your movements
on the night.

221
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,720
You could show us what you saw.
What you heard!

222
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,400
I didn't see anything.

223
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,840
Why are you so interested
in this case, anyway?

224
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,320
There are hundreds of unsolved murders

225
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,520
out there for you lot
to get your teeth into.

226
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,240
Even a cretin like Seger knows that.

227
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,240
Because Susan Jasper was my mother.

228
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,120
Moira and Maggie were my sisters.

229
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,320
I was staying at a friend's
the night it happened.

230
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,200
I don't believe you.

231
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,320
Then maybe you'll believe this.

232
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,240
Carter was my mother's maiden name.

233
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,640
I took it when I left school.

234
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,240
I'd never been allowed to work
on the Jasper case

235
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,040
if they'd known who I was.

236
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,640
Okay.

237
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,720
How many cameras are you running
in here?

238
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,240
In here?

239
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,320
Five.

240
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,200
In the entire place...

241
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,520
...90.

242
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,200
It was a crime
that shocked the nation.

243
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,000
Less than six hours after
this footage was filmed...

244
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,320
three of the family members
would be dead...

245
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,920
and a fourth would only survive after
extensive life-saving surgery.

246
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,640
For Susan Jasper, her husband Sam...

247
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,720
and their six-year-old twin daughters
Moira and Maggie...

248
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,840
the birthday celebrations would soon
turn to unimaginable horror.

249
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,920
It was here
in this isolated farmhouse,

250
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,000
that the killer struck between
10 PM and 12 midnight.

251
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,720
Someone's trying to get in.

252
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,200
- This your doing, isn't it?
- No. No one knows I'm here! I promise!

253
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,360
I've got a gun!

254
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,200
I didn't do
whatever you think I did!

255
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,240
Go! Go! Go!

256
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,360
Armed, wait! Stay here!

257
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,600
Frisk him.
He said he was armed.

258
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,320
Armed, eh?

259
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,320
Berretta Nine Millimeter, I'll wager.

260
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,120
Emeric!

261
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,520
Don't tell me.

262
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,040
I'm a sight for sore eyes.
That's what you're thinking, right?

263
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,920
No?

264
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,920
Well, you certainly are, Veil.

265
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,720
Seeing you there...

266
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,120
all vulnerable like that
almost makes me a believer.

267
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,400
- A believer?
- Visualization therapy.

268
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,520
Doctors say you've just got to visualize
the thing you most want in the world...

269
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,520
and presto, they come to pass.

270
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,920
If that was true
you'd be dead long since.

271
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,320
Maybe we'll both get what we want
eh, Veil?

272
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,320
Well, well, well. Miss Carter.

273
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,520
I haven't touched her, I swear.
She begged to come in.

274
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,520
You can check my tapes.
The camera's running the entire time.

275
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,640
Running were they, these cameras?
Five years ago?

276
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,840
Been running for the last 10
thanks to you.

277
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,440
In that case, where do you keep your
what do you call them, rushes?

278
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,040
There's some in particular
we'd like a look at.

279
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,800
Just give me a time and a date.

280
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,920
October the 15th, 1998, between...

281
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,920
- Mountjoy?
- 7 PM and midnight.

282
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,320
That shouldn't be a problem.

283
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,720
Of course you could always just tell us
what you were doing five years ago, Veil.

284
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,720
Can you tell me what you were doing?
To the night?

285
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,240
I could tell you I wasn't brutally
assaulting and murdering...

286
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,120
a 25 year old woman called Mary Shaw.

287
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,800
That makes two of us then
doesn't it?

288
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,800
- He's killed someone else?
- I haven't killed anyone!

289
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,240
Ever. And I can prove it.

290
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,320
- I just need to go in there.
- Is that where you keep the tapes?

291
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,320
All 97,663 of them.

292
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,120
Plenty to keep you amused
when they put you away then.

293
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,320
Be able to watch
the lot three times over.

294
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,120
Stick with him.

295
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,760
All right if I take this?

296
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,000
- I like to keep a record.
- We've noticed.

297
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,800
June...

298
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,320
July...

299
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,240
August... September...

300
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,120
So this is it. They've done it.

301
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,120
They've got to me.
Somehow they've set me up.

302
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,720
I was right all along.

303
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,320
Despite everything
I just wasn't careful enough.

304
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,640
Is that it?

305
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,920
Done and dusted.

306
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,840
I must maintain control.

307
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,200
Can't let them see I'm upset.
I haven't come this far...

308
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,400
eluded their efforts for so long
to fail now.

309
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,120
Shit.

310
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,120
I forgot a tape.

311
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,520
Do you mind if I go back and get it?

312
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,240
For fuck's sake, Sean.

313
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,040
Hurry it up. This place gives me
the fucking creeps.

314
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,840
What is it with you, anyway?
You some kind of mole?

315
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,640
I feel at home in the darkness
if that's what you mean.

316
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,640
What the fuck!

317
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,040
I'm sorry, all right?
You left me no choice!

318
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,720
Sean!

319
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,440
Open this fucking gate!

320
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,520
Sean!

321
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,120
Oh, yeah?
What are you going to do?

322
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,400
Accuse me of a murder
I didn't commit?

323
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,520
Lock me up and throw away the key?

324
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,640
Forgive me
but I've heard that one before!

325
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,440
Shit!

326
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,200
Seger.

327
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,120
Things to remember. Four.

328
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,240
The first law of forensics.
Lockhart's Theory.

329
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,240
Every contact leaves a trace.

330
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,200
If I leave nothing anywhere...

331
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,040
there'll be nothing they can
trace back to me.

332
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,840
- Where are they?
- I don't know who you are or what you want.

333
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,320
That's very odd.

334
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,840
Cause not 12 hours ago you were telling me
you know me better than I know myself.

335
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,440
Veil!

336
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,240
You finally got something right
didn't you, Sherlock?

337
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,240
You are in a shitload of trouble
my friend.

338
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,520
That a fact? Lest I'm much mistaken...

339
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,400
you're the one being held at knifepoint by
a supposed quadruple killer.

340
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,600
But then again, what do I know?

341
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,200
I'm not the expert
in crime scene analysis.

342
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,600
What do you want?

343
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,920
You're inside my mind. You tell me.

344
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,520
Perhaps I'm here to fulfill

345
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,520
one of my 'perverted fantasies'
one of my 'dark dreams'.

346
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,520
You won't get away with this, Veil.

347
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,640
According to you

348
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,320
I've already got away with
killing an entire fucking family!

349
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,320
If you want to talk about the Jasper murders
I suggest you put the knife down now.

350
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,000
There are only six things I'm interested
in discussing with you, Seger!

351
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,440
They're manufactured by Sony...

352
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,920
they last one hour each...

353
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,720
and they cover the hours between 6 PM
and 12 midnight...

354
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,320
on October the 15th, 1998.

355
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,440
And you've got them...
and I want them!

356
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,800
You've lost me, Veil.

357
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,400
The only thing being lost
in this room is my patience...

358
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:21,720
shortly to be followed
by your fucking life!

359
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,240
Now look. Look at me!

360
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,040
You're distraught, I can see that.

361
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,240
You're angry at yourself for finally
being caught...

362
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,640
and blaming me is probably
some last-ditch strategy.

363
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,320
In my professional opinion, Veil...

364
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,840
Don't you dare.

365
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,600
Don't you fucking dare try to profile me
you bastard.

366
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,240
Professional opinion?

367
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,120
Professional fucking bullshit!

368
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,120
You wouldn't know a criminal if he came up
and robbed you at gunpoint.

369
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,240
I tell you what I do know, Veil.

370
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,040
It's that I know that know...

371
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,120
that you're not going to use
this knife on me.

372
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,800
Oh, no?

373
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,520
You do know...

374
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,720
Know what?

375
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:54,000
You, you know...
you know I'm innocent.

376
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,720
You've known all along.

377
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,000
If you really believed I'd killed
the Jaspers...

378
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,920
If I...

379
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:11,440
was capable of this kind of
brutality...

380
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,240
you'd be on your knees by now.
You'd be saying your prayers.

381
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,560
What I meant, Veil...

382
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,320
is that you're the type
of killer that can't

383
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,720
bear to get his hands dirty that can't
bear to get up close and personal.

384
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,240
A knife is not your kind of weapon.
It takes guts to use a knife.

385
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:37,240
No, a coward like you needs to use
a gun to get some distance.

386
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,440
To put you at one remove from the event
so that you can observe it.

387
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,520
So that you can stand outside of it
whilst it's happening.

388
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:51,040
Probably relates to an innate
voyeurism...

389
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,520
with its roots
in an abusive childhood!

390
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,600
Get away from there!

391
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,200
Goes straight to the local police station.
You're going nowhere, Veil.

392
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,920
Stop wriggling
my deviant little friend!

393
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,520
Bastard! Bastard!

394
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,040
Fuck!

395
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,720
Things to unlearn. One.

396
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,520
CCTV is to be avoided.

397
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:24,040
Can't claim I was on Oxford Street
if the camera picks me up in Portneath.

398
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,640
It won't be easy.

399
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,240
Seeking out cameras is encoded
in my DNA.

400
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,240
I'm drawn to them like a cop
to corruption.

401
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,000
Like Emeric to a payoff.

402
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,920
I'm seeing it, but I don't believe it.

403
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,040
Don't mind telling you, Veil...

404
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,040
beginning to frighten me
this visualization thing.

405
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,520
I imagined you sitting there...

406
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,240
and there you are.

407
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,720
Anyone would think...

408
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,840
our destinies are connected.

409
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,920
Why don't you just visualize me
pleading guilty?

410
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,400
See how that works.

411
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,720
If I had anything to hide
I wouldn't have handed myself in, would I?

412
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,920
If you had nothing to hide
you wouldn't have run off.

413
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,840
October 15th, 1998, Sean.

414
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,320
Let's just start with that.
Where were you then?

415
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,840
Who were you with?
What were you doing?

416
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,440
Answer those questions
to our satisfaction...

417
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,600
And you'll see to it that evidence
is fabricated to the contrary...

418
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,320
and I won't see the light of day
for 15 years.

419
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,400
30, if I had my way.

420
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,720
- Can I use this?
- That's what it's there for.

421
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,840
That's me there.

422
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,840
Not the Railway Rapist.
You've got him.

423
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,520
We know that, Sean.

424
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,320
What we want to know is where you were.

425
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,440
Portneath. Went away for
the day and a night.

426
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,520
Strange time of year to go
to the seaside.

427
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,160
That's precisely why I went.
Less crowds.

428
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,520
You can see in the next shot.

429
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,720
He hasn't changed much over the years
has he, Mountjoy?

430
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,240
He's even got a cut on his lip.

431
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,320
I'm not an expert...

432
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,360
but I think you've been using
make-up, Sean.

433
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,520
Could have been shot yesterday.

434
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,000
Do you know what timecode is?

435
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,600
Yeah. And I also know it can be adjusted
on certain cameras.

436
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,320
Maybe it can, maybe it can't.

437
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,440
But you can't alter a specific headline
in a newspaper, though, can you?

438
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,600
Anyone can see that's
the 15th of the 10th, '98.

439
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,920
You can check with the newspaper
if you don't believe me.

440
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,920
Could do.

441
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,840
Then again, we could just pop down
the local library and nick a copy.

442
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,840
I don't know what you're trying to imply
but I do know this...

443
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,640
I'm covered. I'm alibi'd up.

444
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,320
Talking of which, where were you
at 11:45 the same night?

445
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,240
11:45...

446
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,800
Jesus Christ, Veil.

447
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,440
You ever turn that thing off?

448
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,520
And give you lot the chance to
fit me up?

449
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,920
- No way.
- For Chrissake

450
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,240
Just get it to 11:45, will you?

451
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,200
Satisfied?

452
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,240
- My curiosity isn't.
- Nor mine.

453
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,840
See, the thing is, Veil...

454
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,440
nothing you've shown me explains this.

455
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,840
- They're not mine.
- No one's saying they are.

456
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:16,120
- Mine are all clearly marked.
- Meticulously so. We had noticed.

457
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:22,120
So... what's the problem?

458
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,720
You're about to find out.

459
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,580
Celebrating?

460
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:15,820
- Sorry?
- Bad luck to drink champagne on your own.

461
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,060
You are on your own, aren't you?

462
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:21,180
Looks younger there, Mountjoy
wouldn't you say?

463
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,180
About five years, give or take.

464
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,580
Kathy. Kathy Burton.

465
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:34,900
Tom Prophet. Tom Prophet.

466
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:40,180
Okay...

467
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,380
So I gave some girl
a false name in a bar.

468
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,500
And so would you in my position.

469
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:53,180
My notoriety.
It's not a hanging offense.

470
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,780
- Sean, we don't hang people anymore.
- Unfortunately.

471
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,500
I thought this was about Mary Shaw.

472
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:05,380
- It is.
- But she said...

473
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,100
Kathy. Kathy Burton.

474
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:12,980
- And you said...
- Tom Prophet. Tom Prophet.

475
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,780
I know.
What's she doing filming me anyway?

476
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,420
The question is...

477
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,700
why don't your tapes match hers, Veil?

478
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,300
I want to call my lawyer.

479
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,300
I call him and...

480
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,180
I still get to keep my cameras?

481
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:37,580
Prophet? That's an unusual name.

482
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:43,300
Don't suppose you foresee anything
interesting happening to us tonight, do you?

483
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:46,580
This is a setup.
Any fool can see that.

484
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,380
You didn't.

485
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,980
Aren't you with anyone?

486
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:59,380
Stood me up. Expect you find
that hard to believe.

487
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,460
Can I get you folks another glass?

488
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:15,980
So, you keep it running all the time?
The camera?

489
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:22,180
- 24, 7, 52.
- Cool.

490
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,020
I'm serious.

491
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:54,700
I only do it with... a condom.

492
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,700
- From behind.
- What?

493
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:05,500
It's nothing personal.
I have to take precautions.

494
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,380
It's usually me saying that.

495
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:16,180
Come on. I think it's time you
filled me up.

496
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,500
- Well?
- Well what?

497
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,580
The man who should be sitting here's
the man who sent you those tapes.

498
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:30,700
The man that paid her to film me
to set me up.

499
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,180
No one sent us those tapes, Veil.

500
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,780
We found them on her body.

501
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:45,060
She was still wired up
when she was killed.

502
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:54,580
Guess sometimes you just get lucky on
an investigation, huh?

503
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:19,180
- You're sure you're okay with this?
- Can't wait.

504
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,780
Okay...

505
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:27,380
It's only until we're inside.
Across the threshold, so to speak.

506
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,980
Till you've hid your girlfriend's
knickers, you mean.

507
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:36,380
- Look, I know how this looks.
- So do we, Veil.

508
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,780
So will the jury.

509
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:40,580
Careful.

510
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,780
All right? Don't look.

511
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:51,060
Okay? Won't be a moment.

512
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,460
Now stay there, all right?

513
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,180
What the fuck is this shit?

514
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:14,780
You promised you wouldn't look.
I didn't mean for you to see this.

515
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,900
I want go
no one said anything about this!

516
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:20,820
No one? No one who?

517
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,700
Heard that did you?

518
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,580
I'd make a note of
that timecode if I were you.

519
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,580
Liable to be a cornerstone of my defence
this ever comes to court.

520
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,180
You heard what she said
'No one said anything about this.'

521
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,300
No one. That means someone. Someone sent her.
Someone put her up to this!

522
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,980
He's the one you should be looking for
not me!

523
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,780
Get the fuck away from me you freak!

524
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:51,300
Look, I don't know who you've been
talking to, who sent you...

525
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:54,220
but, yes, I was accused
of murder once.

526
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:57,180
Accused, not convicted! I was accused!

527
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,060
It could happen to anybody.
Wrong place, wrong time...

528
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:04,060
wrong interests in life, and Wham!
You're down like a ton of bricks!

529
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,100
Back off! I'll scream
the fucking place down!

530
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:11,100
Okay! You can leave any time you like!
I'm not stopping you!

531
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,900
- You're going to kill me, aren't you?
- No, no, no.

532
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,900
I've seen all those things and now
you're going to kill me!

533
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,380
No, no. I've never killed anyone!

534
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:22,580
I just don't want you running off
in a panic.

535
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:26,180
It's dark out there. It's late.
It's dangerous.

536
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,020
- Let me get you a taxi.
- I don't want.

537
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,700
- It'll only take a minute.
- I don't want a fucking taxi!

538
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:34,860
I just want to go!
Please! I won't tell anybody!

539
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,860
Tell anyone?
There's nothing to tell.

540
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,260
Exactly. I know that now.
I'm just...

541
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:47,180
Look, my flatmates
will be looking for me.

542
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,580
If I don't come home
they'll call the police.

543
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:54,780
Hey, at least let me
walk you then, yeah?

544
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,100
Walk me?

545
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,100
I don't want you running off
on your own.

546
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,700
Anything could happen.
People have seen us together.

547
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:04,460
- I'll get blamed!
- You want to walk me?

548
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:08,660
In the dark?
Down those streets? You?

549
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,060
Just until we see a taxi.

550
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:14,180
I'll pay. Nothing dodgy.
Proper black cab and everything.

551
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,860
You let me put you in it.

552
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:19,180
I'll take the driver's number and license plate
and that'll be that.

553
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:22,580
I'll film you driving off and then no one
can accuse me of anything.

554
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:25,980
I'll know you're safe and we can
part company amicably.

555
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:30,380
- Yeah?
- All right.

556
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:36,660
- All rignt, on one condition.
- Yes, yes. Anything. Yes, please.

557
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:41,860
You let me go up to the street
first on my own.

558
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:45,380
Yes, yes. But you'll have to
let me get the door.

559
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,260
Cause it's a bit stiff.

560
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:57,180
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

561
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,380
You saw what happened.

562
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:08,700
She knocked me unconsciousness
and then she ran off.

563
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:12,980
I mean, whatever happened after that
it's got nothing to do with me!

564
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:19,660
Girl comes back to your flat
gets blindfolded...

565
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:22,700
disappears off the face of the earth
for five years...

566
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:27,100
then turns up dead, and you say
it's got nothing to do with you?

567
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:30,380
I offered to get her a cab.
I begged her to get her a cab.

568
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,100
You heard me.
I was concerned with her safety.

569
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:34,700
It's all there on film.
Camera doesn't lie!

570
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,820
Someone's camera is lying.

571
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:41,700
Face it, Veil
your ninety-odd thousand video tapes...

572
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:44,460
aren't worth the stock
they're recorded on.

573
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,380
That's what this is about
isn't it?

574
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:55,700
Discrediting my archive.

575
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:59,500
My safety net.

576
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:03,500
Everything I've worked for
built up...

577
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:06,780
to protect me from you!

578
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,860
I've got something to show you.

579
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,780
Time to say hello to
an old friend, Veil.

580
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,700
I don't want to see her.

581
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:33,500
I don't want any more images
in my head.

582
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:36,180
You've got to face up to
your crimes sometime, Sean.

583
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,780
Think of it as therapy.

584
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:44,700
The first step on the long hard road
to rehabilitation.

585
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:47,700
As a psychologist acquaintance
of mine used to say...

586
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,780
There's no cure
without confrontation.'

587
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,780
Isn't that right, Saul?

588
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,780
You think I did this?

589
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,380
Your fingerprints are
on the knife, Sean.

590
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,700
- But I was...
- Wearing gloves?

591
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,180
- No, no.
- Blood on the carpet's

592
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,220
a perfect match for your DNA.

593
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:23,100
They saw you running from the scene.

594
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,980
He was alive then.
I can prove it.

595
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,060
I've got it on tape!

596
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:34,660
Time of death was two o'clock
yesterday afternoon, Veil.

597
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,900
You got yourself on tape then?

598
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,780
Yesterday afternoon?

599
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:49,300
Come on, Sean.
Cat got your tongue?

600
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:51,300
Got his tapes more like.

601
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,380
You did this!

602
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,060
You did this!

603
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,660
You set me up.

604
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:13,900
You killed Mary Shaw
and stole my tapes...

605
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,780
so I'd have to make new ones...

606
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,700
so I'd have no alibi...
so I'd have no evidence

607
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:21,180
nothing to prove where I was...

608
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:23,700
when you did this!

609
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:19,060
You seem kind of relaxed
if you don't mind me saying...

610
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:24,580
for a man who's going to spend
the next 30 years sucking unwashed dick.

611
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:33,020
You seem kind of jealous
if you don't mind me saying.

612
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:40,260
Mountjoy! Let him go.

613
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:44,380
- Let him what?
- You heard me.

614
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:47,260
I don't understand.

615
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:28,500
He paid a guy to shadow him...

616
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:32,580
Keep him under surveillance
the entire time he was in Portneath.

617
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:38,700
I always do when I feel
I need some extra insurance.

618
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:44,380
No way I was going to leave myself
an entire day short.

619
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:54,980
You're wasting your time.
He's covered for yesterday.

620
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:59,900
He's got 24 hours of tape
and a witness.

621
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:06,700
- We've got nothing to hold him on.
- What about Mary Shaw?

622
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,300
- He's not covered for her.
- Other tapes, after the ones

623
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:11,700
that are missing show him at home
after she left.

624
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:13,220
Five minute gap...

625
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:18,380
but it's not enough.
Not after the last time.

626
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,780
But he's already
discredited his tapes!

627
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,660
It's you lot who's discredited.

628
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:44,780
Go on. Fuck off
before we change our minds.

629
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:40,260
Motherfucker!
You fucking laugh at me!

630
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:44,180
Fucking camera! Come here!

631
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:45,980
Come here!

632
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:54,620
You know who I saw on
this slab once, Veil?

633
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,660
You know who lay on it...

634
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,380
stretched out...

635
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:07,060
her little broken body staring
sightless at the ceiling?

636
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,300
Maggie Jasper.

637
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:17,500
Pathologist cut into her
with one of these.

638
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:22,180
Practically sliced her
in two in front of me.

639
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:25,780
You ever attended a postmortem, Veil?

640
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:28,980
I don't suppose you have.
You just like to cause them, don't you?

641
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:33,180
Well, don't worry.
Be attending one soon.

642
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,260
Your own.

643
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:42,060
I'm an innocent man.

644
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:48,580
Bastard!

645
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:07,180
I'm not...
I'm not leaving you behind, Veil!

646
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,980
I'm taking you with me!

647
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,180
You hear me, Veil?

648
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:21,980
There'll be a hundred more of these going off
if you run around there.

649
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:23,780
Word's out you got away
with it again.

650
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:25,300
I haven't done anything to get away with!

651
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,100
This time or the last.

652
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:30,980
- What happened to your neck?
- Police brutality happened to my neck!

653
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,700
It's them you should be
exposing, not me!

654
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,620
Come on, get in.

655
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,580
Entitle me to an exclusive that...

656
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:53,300
in the normal course of affairs.

657
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:58,580
Yeah, I can see it now...

658
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:02,900
Victim's Daughter Rescues Killer
From Lynch Mob.'

659
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:07,900
Killer?
Is that a confession, Sean Veil?

660
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:09,300
No.

661
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,460
Are you wired?

662
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:24,460
Happy, or would you like me
to remove my bra as well?

663
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:30,180
You didn't need to do that.
You could have just said yes or no.

664
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,100
Would you have believed me?

665
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:40,180
Would you believe me if I told you
I did not kill Mary Shaw?

666
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:42,100
- I did not kill...
- Yes.

667
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,660
Aren't you going to ask me why?

668
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:50,380
Why?

669
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:54,060
Because I know who killed
my mother and sisters.

670
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:58,700
And I know it wasn't you.

671
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:17,980
Seger!

672
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:28,580
What's going on?

673
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:34,500
Shall you tell him, or shall I?

674
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:38,300
But he's dead! I saw him!

675
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:51,260
The evidence would suggest otherwise.

676
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:08,780
Blood on the carpet's
a perfect match...

677
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:11,580
Police saw you running
from the scene.

678
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:15,780
He's been fucking with you, Sean!
Playing with your mind!

679
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,100
Profiler's games!

680
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:22,700
Convinced Emeric if you saw him dead
it would push you over the edge.

681
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:26,980
Get you to break down.
Confess to the Mary Shaw thing.

682
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:30,380
At the very least, he figured it would
open up a crack in your defence.

683
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,980
Cast doubt on the provenance
of your tapes.

684
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:34,980
How do you know all this?

685
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,780
Asked me to do it first, didn't he?

686
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:42,380
Be the guinea pig. Play dead.

687
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:44,980
Thought if you were in the frame
for killing me

688
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:48,380
surviving Jasper daughter
you'd go right off the deep end.

689
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:51,500
I almost agreed to it.

690
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,780
Then I had a better idea.

691
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:56,300
While he was off playing corpse

692
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,780
gave me the chance to
look through his house.

693
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:02,180
Always thought the evil fucker...

694
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:05,380
knew more about the murders
than he was letting on!

695
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:10,900
And I was right.
Guess what I found?

696
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:17,100
Nine millimeter Berretta.

697
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:20,980
The Jasper murder weapon, Sean.

698
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,980
Finally got it in your hands.

699
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:34,660
He did it?
He killed your family?

700
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,260
It was him?

701
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:41,860
Think about it.

702
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:45,180
Before the Jasper murders
what was he?

703
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:49,780
A small-time
small-town psychologist...

704
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:52,900
working with petty ex-offenders
like you.

705
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:56,380
I looked into his past.

706
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:01,580
He tried to get
into the cops and failed!

707
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:04,780
What better way to get one up
on the profession

708
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:08,380
that had rejected him than commit
a headline-grabbing murder

709
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,460
then move in and solve it?

710
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:15,900
What better way to get a fat leg
onto the profiling ladder?

711
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:18,580
Don't listen to her, Veil!

712
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:21,500
She's the one
who's playing games with you.

713
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:24,780
She's trying to get you to kill me.

714
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:27,100
For a so-called
profiling genius, Seger

715
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:29,900
you have an amazing knack
of getting things wrong.

716
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:32,500
He's not going to kill you.

717
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,580
I am.

718
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:42,980
No, I don't want any part of this.
Please!

719
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:52,980
You've been a part of it
from the beginning, Sean.

720
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:57,380
Might as well be here for the end.

721
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:02,780
Please. Not here.

722
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:05,580
Listen to him, young Jasper!
He's talking sense.

723
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:08,100
Besides, if you kill me
you'd be killing the wrong person.

724
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:11,780
If you kill me, the truth
will die with me.

725
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:13,580
What's he on about?

726
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,460
He's going to say I did it again
to save his own skin.

727
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,260
Need a skull made of kevlar
to do that!

728
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:21,460
I found this gun in your house, Seger!
I've had it tested!

729
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:24,180
- Did you test it for prints?
- Prints?

730
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:28,780
No point. A guy like you, forensically
aware, would've wiped it clean.

731
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:31,780
A guy like me would never have had it
in my house in the first place...

732
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,900
my finger had been on the trigger!

733
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:38,580
My prints are on that gun now.
He's going to say I planted it.

734
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:40,380
That's what he's going to...

735
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:42,620
He's going to say what he was doing with
it or he's going to die!

736
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,580
That's what he's going to say!

737
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:47,580
Someone sent it to me, okay?

738
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:51,380
I should have got rid of it long since
but I suffer from the enthusiast'smalady!

739
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,380
I kept it as a souvenir
a piece of crime memorabilia

740
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,500
for my own black museum.

741
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:59,500
Classic serial killer behavior
keeping souvenirs.

742
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:01,980
Says so in his own books.

743
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:05,180
I'm a collector, Veil
not a killer!

744
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:07,500
You're a lying prick
is what you are.

745
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,980
Who sent it to you?

746
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:15,900
The truth is not always the panacea
we imagine it to be, Katie Jasper.

747
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:21,860
But if you really want to know who killed
your mother and sisters...

748
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,220
I do.

749
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:27,380
Then I suggest you slice open your arm.

750
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:31,500
What?

751
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:40,460
The blood of your family's killer
runs in your own veins.

752
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:47,380
Your father sent me that gun
and a note confessing everything...

753
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:51,780
the day the trial
against Veil collapsed.

754
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:55,060
The day your father hung himself.

755
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:01,700
My father hung himself because
he couldn't live without Mum...

756
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:07,260
without Moira and Maggie.

757
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:10,780
Couldn't live with killing them
you mean.

758
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:14,300
He thought your mother had been
having an affair.

759
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:18,100
He thought that Moira
and Maggie weren't his.

760
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:23,020
That is why he shot them
in the face.

761
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:26,860
No...

762
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:30,460
To show his hatred.
His contempt.

763
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,580
No...

764
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:35,980
Wouldn't have got away with it
at the time if your mother

765
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,700
hadn't tried to wrestle
the gun off him.

766
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:42,180
If she hadn't wounded him
in the struggle.

767
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:47,180
She gave him an out, a means to turn
the investigation away from himself.

768
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:51,980
It's not true!

769
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:55,220
It's a lie!

770
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,580
If that's the truth
why didn't you tell?

771
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:04,060
I'd just gained a foothold
in my profession.

772
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,180
I had to stick to my guns.
I had to stick to my theory

773
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:09,100
that it was Veil.

774
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:13,500
I didn't want my reputation undermined
any more than you would want yours.

775
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:17,900
Any more than you'd want to be known as
the daughter of a killer.

776
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:47,180
Do you know how I've lived
these last 10 years?

777
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:49,100
What I've been through?

778
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:54,900
I bet you Emeric doesn't
even know, does he?

779
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:58,780
Fucker's had it in for me all this time.
Wants to take me to the grave with him!

780
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:01,820
Probably what's killing him.

781
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:06,660
And you...

782
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:12,460
Look, no one needs to
die here, Veil.

783
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:17,180
No one needs to suffer
any more, okay?

784
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:22,300
We've all got things
on each other now.

785
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:27,900
All we have to do is to
forget this ever happened...

786
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:31,380
and carry on with
the rest of our lives.

787
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:34,300
You sick fuck!

788
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:40,780
- Someone died because of you!
- That's nonsense.

789
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:44,060
My work saves lives.
Catches criminals.

790
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:48,100
Takes them off the streets, puts them
behind bars, where they belong.

791
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:51,100
I may have been a little economical
with the truth as regards this, but...

792
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:54,660
Stop her, Veil!
And I'll exonerate you, I swear!

793
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:56,500
She's only going to blame it
on you, Veil!

794
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:58,300
Why else do you think
she's doing it here?

795
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:01,580
For God's sake, man, do something!

796
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:06,220
- Who do you think killed Mary Shaw?
- That was an accident.

797
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:10,780
This is deliberate.

798
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:29,100
I expect you'll want to
thank me for that.

799
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:54,380
What?
Do you think he's still alive?

800
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:57,100
Do you think this is another stunt?

801
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,780
I was hoping it was.

802
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:06,180
But his name would have to be Lazarus
to come back from that.

803
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:09,180
Let me see.

804
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:34,100
What are you doing?

805
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:57,580
Don't. Please.

806
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:06,900
Please, please. Don't do that.

807
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:12,300
- You sure you mean that, Sean?
- Yes.

808
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:15,180
Doesn't feel like it to me.

809
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:23,860
Don't.

810
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,500
How long has it been, Sean?

811
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:41,300
Three years?

812
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:43,700
Five?

813
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:47,580
I bet the last woman you had
down here was Mary.

814
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:51,780
I didn't have her.
I didn't touch her.

815
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:58,180
No. But you wanted to. She told me.

816
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:01,380
She told me you'd freaked her out.

817
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,900
Her death had nothing to do with me.

818
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:12,500
You're right.
Responsibility for that lies at my door.

819
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:16,980
Me who hired her.

820
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:21,100
Me who asked her to do
what I'm doing to you now...

821
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:24,780
get a sample of your DNA.

822
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:27,900
Semen preferably.

823
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:33,180
Something I could use to
set you up...

824
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:36,660
fabricate a rape charge.

825
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:41,060
Came on all heavy afterwards, Mary.

826
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,780
Said you'd put the fear
of God into her.

827
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:50,580
- I should have warned you about it.
- Is that it?

828
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:52,700
- That's all I have.
- Fuck off!

829
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:55,180
Don't touch that!

830
01:22:57,820 --> 01:22:59,500
Next thing I knew...

831
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:08,460
I thought about trying to implicate you
at the time, but...

832
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:13,980
I was younger then.
And frightened.

833
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:16,580
I panicked.

834
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:19,900
In the end, I just...

835
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:23,500
buried her along with the tapes.

836
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:28,780
Thought I'd wait till someone
came across her.

837
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:32,700
Bide my time.

838
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:40,660
Coming up to the anniversary...

839
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,980
anonymous phone call was
all it took.

840
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:49,780
That and getting your tapes.

841
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:55,180
That's why I was there
that night before the raid.

842
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:57,180
It was you?

843
01:23:58,020 --> 01:23:59,980
Thought they might exonerate you.

844
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:03,580
Thought I might be seen on them.

845
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:08,700
I was in the bar that night.

846
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:11,860
Watching.

847
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:15,580
Get off of me!

848
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:23,100
How long do you think you
can hold out, Sean?

849
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:27,180
I've held out...

850
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:31,380
...for 10 years.

851
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:41,700
Come on.

852
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:44,260
Let it go.

853
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:47,580
You know you want to.

854
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:14,420
Things to remember. Five.

855
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:19,060
Never have sex without a condom.
Ever.

856
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:24,180
Once they get hold of your sperm
you're fucked.

857
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:50,980
You're going to accuse me
of all this, aren't you?

858
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:58,380
Say I killed Seger. Raped you.

859
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:20,700
You don't have to do this, you know.

860
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:24,380
As far as I'm concerned
Seger had it coming.

861
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,660
We're both victims here.
We're both...

862
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:29,780
And when they come and arrest you
for Mary Shaw?

863
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:36,300
When they decide they can prosecute you
on the evidence of her tapes alone?

864
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:44,300
When they come for you for Seger?
For real...

865
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:47,180
What are you going to say, Sean?

866
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:51,700
You're right.
Detective Inspector Emeric? '

867
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:54,820
It was me? I admit it? '

868
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:04,380
Don't worry, Sean...

869
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:08,460
this is one part of your life
that won't be going on tape.

870
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:18,300
No, no!

871
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,860
I didn't do nothing!

872
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:39,780
I didn't do nothing!

873
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:43,460
I didn't do nothing!

874
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:00,780
Jesus Christ!

875
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:23,700
And you filmed all this?

876
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:25,900
Confessions? Shootings? Everything?

877
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:31,700
Her fucking you?
You?

878
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:35,780
- Strange as it may seem.
- So where's the tapes?

879
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,260
She torched them.

880
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:46,460
Right. That's it.

881
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:52,180
Sean Veil, I'm arresting you on suspicion
of the murders of Katie...

882
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:53,980
I...

883
01:28:58,020 --> 01:28:59,580
can...

884
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:05,300
- show you.
- What?

885
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:16,460
I can show you.

886
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:28,500
Webcam.

887
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:37,180
I managed to switch it to record
after she turned my cameras off.

888
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:48,380
You won't believe me, Sean
but...

889
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:52,460
I'm genuinely sorry to
have to do this to you.

890
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:57,700
After all these years...

891
01:29:57,820 --> 01:30:02,300
I just couldn't cope with people looking
at me the way they probably look at you.

892
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:05,580
Thinking, 'Killer's blood runs
through her veins.'

893
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:07,180
- It doesn't...
- Thinking

894
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:12,180
She shares the same genes as the father
that killed her mother and sisters.'

895
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:15,300
- You do.
- I know.

896
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:21,780
And if it ever got out
if people knew or even suspected...

897
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:24,180
it would turn me into a freak.

898
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:28,860
I've survived.

899
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:32,900
But at what cost?

900
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:40,500
- Seger was right about one thing.
- What?

901
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:44,100
The darkness invisible in
the heart of most killers.

902
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:48,100
Looking at you...

903
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:52,660
no one would ever believe you could
even pull that trigger.

904
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,060
Well, they'd be wrong
wouldn't they?

905
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:59,260
Seger could tell them that! Mary Shaw!

906
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:00,660
But you didn't shoot her.

907
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:02,980
It was an accident.
You said so yourself.

908
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:04,700
It was.

909
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:09,380
So is this, in its own way.

910
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:11,900
No, please! Please!

911
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:33,580
No, don't! Don't! Don't!

912
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,580
We can find a way out of this!

913
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:37,860
We can come up with a plan!

914
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:40,580
Please! Trust me!
Trust me, please!

915
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:46,100
Please, please, don't.
Don't. Please.

916
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:48,580
- No!
- Please! Please, please...

917
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:54,380
Don't!

918
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:57,060
Move away from her, Veil.

919
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:00,860
- I'll only ask you once.
- You don't understand!

920
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:02,580
It's you who doesn't understand, Veil.

921
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:05,180
I don't have time for
hostage negotiation.

922
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:15,580
I've been visualizing
that postmortem, Veil.

923
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:20,500
Seeing that buzz-saw cut you up.
That can only mean one thing...

924
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:24,180
- Don't. He didn't do it.
- What?

925
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:29,300
Truth is, he's the only innocent person
in any of this! Don't!

926
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:31,780
We'll have to let God decide that
won't we?

927
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:33,660
Be judging us both soon.

928
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:57,580
No! No!

929
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:25,780
I didn't do nothing!

930
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:31,980
I didn't do nothing!

931
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:36,020
I didn't do nothing!

932
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:47,260
I didn't do nothing!

933
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:04,500
I didn't do nothing!

934
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:09,180
I didn't kill anybody!

935
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:12,580
You'll still have to come and give us
a statement at some point.

936
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:19,460
I can give it on camera?

937
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:22,500
You can give it on a dozen
if you want.

938
01:34:30,220 --> 01:34:33,700
Sean, if I was
to accidentally lose this...

939
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:37,900
Accidentally on purpose lose it?

940
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:41,900
No, everyday, non-conspiracy lose it.

941
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:44,460
What would that mean to your defence?

942
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:48,580
Nothing.

943
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:53,580
I'm covered.

944
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:58,060
- I'm Alibi'd up.
- How's that?

945
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:10,100
I e-mailed it to the newspaper
before you got here.

946
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:06,700
Things to remember. Six.

947
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:10,500
Never stop filming yourself.
Ever.

948
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:16,980
Off-camera is off-guard.

949
