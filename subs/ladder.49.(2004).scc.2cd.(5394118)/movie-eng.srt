00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:15,623
Taxes, always taxes.
How about sex?

83
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:20,870

The other members of
Ladder 49 make it out.

119
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:27,356
He is in the stairwell
with the victim.

00:31:30,702 --> 00:31:32,033
There's no way around it.

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,117
How are we going to

176
00:32:00,565 --> 00:32:01,827
What do you need?

177
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,361
- We need that equipment over here.

And of the Holy Spirit.

You may now kiss the bride.

Mrs Jack Morrison.

00:34:17,268 --> 00:34:19,065
Your husband is an

Look after him for me, will you?

189
00:34:22,674 --> 00:34:26,007
- l'll help him look after himself.
- Even better.

190
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:53,603
All right, this next song goes out to
our newly-wed by special request.

191
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:15,390
Jack, get up here.

192
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:39,139
Sit down, join the club.

193
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:43,417
They are quite a choir, huh.

194
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:57,184
- Captain Kennedy?
- You're the rookie?

195
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,683
- You Catholic?
- Yeah.

196
00:37:27,058 --> 00:37:29,891
- Are you a virgin?
- No, Father.

197
00:37:36,067 --> 00:37:39,059
lf you want to have sex,
you should get married.

198
00:37:39,537 --> 00:37:42,062
- l can't.
- Why?

199
00:37:42,206 --> 00:37:46,040
- lt's not allowed.
- What do you mean it's not allowed?

200
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:51,982
Excuse me?

201
00:37:52,116 --> 00:37:53,777

202
00:38:58,116 --> 00:38:59,549
- Here we go.

203
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,350
l am good. l am not drinking.
You can have it.

204
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:09,617
lt's okay. l'm not going to drink.
l'm just going to grab a Coke.

205
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:11,384
What, are you pregnant?

206
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:20,532
l was going to tell you later tonight.
l want to suprise you.

207
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:28,176
No more drinks for Linda.
Double for Jack.

208
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:30,213
He's going to be a father.

209
00:39:59,577 --> 00:40:02,239
- Keep the money.
- Save it for the baby.

210
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,877
Jack, you can't have a baby
without a shower.

211
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:35,375
- l'm getting too old for this shit.
- You got that right.

212
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:57,158
This is bullshit, man.
Let it burn.

213
00:41:27,532 --> 00:41:29,830
Tommy, get the door!

214
00:41:45,082 --> 00:41:47,676
Evacuate now, evacuate now.
Activate the alarm.

215
00:41:59,497 --> 00:42:01,795
lt's no good.

216
00:42:40,238 --> 00:42:42,934
You guys take as much
time off as you need.

217
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:48,561
He wasn't paying attention.

218
00:43:58,316 --> 00:44:00,944
Just shut up and wash the dishes,
rookie.

219
00:44:17,168 --> 00:44:19,329
What the hell is going on here?

220
00:44:24,108 --> 00:44:27,509
l come back from telling a mother
that her son is dead.

221
00:44:27,645 --> 00:44:31,513
And this is going on in my house,
in my house.

222
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:35,380
We deal with this
by sticking together.

223
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,517
We take it. We learn from it.

224
00:44:39,857 --> 00:44:44,123
And we get back to the god damn truck
and that's how we honor Dennis.

225
00:44:44,228 --> 00:44:46,788
You got that?

226
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:54,597
Do it.

227
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:44,330
Don't you think it might fall apart?

228
00:47:45,976 --> 00:47:47,807
l hope not.

229
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,184
l'm thinking about changing job.

230
00:47:58,389 --> 00:48:00,220
What do you mean?

231
00:48:06,697 --> 00:48:09,632
Does that mean you will
be taking Dennis's place?

232
00:48:18,209 --> 00:48:20,404
Would you?

233
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:36,384
Capt, this stuff is great.

234
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:39,329
That's my grandfather.

235
00:48:41,198 --> 00:48:42,597
This is his helmet.

236
00:48:43,033 --> 00:48:45,661
These are my dad's.
That's him.

237
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:49,567
He got after he past away.

238
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:54,237
- lt's medal of honor.
- Yeah.

239
00:48:54,745 --> 00:48:56,610
So, what's going on?

240
00:48:57,581 --> 00:49:00,141
Something l want to talk to you about.

241
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:04,549
l was thinking about
transferring to Truck.

242
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:09,221
Why do you want to do that for?

243
00:49:10,728 --> 00:49:12,821
Truck is a whole different thing.

244
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:21,236
You get lost in the smoke.
lt's not a good idea.

245
00:49:24,942 --> 00:49:29,345
- l love being on the pipes. lt's just
- Just what?

246
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:33,115
lt's what l want, Mike.

247
00:49:48,766 --> 00:49:52,725
But you got to tell me something,
if this isn't for you,

248
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:56,307
You tell me right away.
You promise?

249
00:49:56,307 --> 00:49:58,207
Yes, sir.

250
00:50:25,669 --> 00:50:27,534
We're coming to get you.

251
00:50:57,368 --> 00:50:59,063
Hey, Lenny. Grab the rope.

252
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:34,026
- Try not to look down, Jack.
- Thanks, Lenny.

253
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:47,611
All right, Tommy. Let it down.

254
00:51:59,129 --> 00:52:01,393
We got you, Jack. You're good.

255
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:15,738
We're on the scene in Chopper 7.

256
00:52:38,569 --> 00:52:41,766
We got a burning building in
downtown on Culbert Street.

257
00:52:41,939 --> 00:52:44,567
A lot of flame, a lot of smoke.

258
00:52:54,785 --> 00:52:57,083
Stop, stop.

259
00:52:57,588 --> 00:53:01,149
Your eyes start to burn and
the heat from the flames,

260
00:53:02,493 --> 00:53:04,518
Just wait, just wait.

261
00:53:09,766 --> 00:53:11,563
There they go.

262
00:53:24,114 --> 00:53:27,515
Close your eyes.
Put your head against me.

263
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,616
You would be okay.
You just stay calm, okay?

264
00:53:54,578 --> 00:53:56,547
He shattered the glass.

265
00:53:56,547 --> 00:53:59,778
They're inside now. We're
going to try get this guy's name.

266
00:54:12,629 --> 00:54:16,030
Let's get in closer, Jerry.
Get in closer for a look.

267
00:54:56,573 --> 00:54:58,131
What's the matter?

268
00:55:00,077 --> 00:55:02,170
l saw you on the news, Jack.

269
00:55:14,091 --> 00:55:16,582
Linda, what's wrong?

270
00:55:16,693 --> 00:55:19,992
l saw you on the news, Jack.
Dangling from a rope.

271
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:23,090
How can you tell me that
it is not dangerous?

272
00:55:24,935 --> 00:55:27,369
When we talk about it, l asked you
and you said it wasn't dangerous.

273
00:55:27,504 --> 00:55:29,199
l said it wasn't anymore dangerous
than being on Engine.

274
00:55:29,306 --> 00:55:31,240
l never said it wasn't dangerous.

275
00:55:31,508 --> 00:55:35,274
Did you see me right now? Do you?

276
00:55:35,979 --> 00:55:38,243
'Coz it isn'tjust about us.

277
00:55:42,486 --> 00:55:45,284
Have you thought about that?

278
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:58,464
l am scare. l can't sleep.

279
00:55:58,802 --> 00:56:02,966
l keep having that dream, about the
in front of the house

280
00:56:03,106 --> 00:56:05,165
When you don't come home.

281
00:58:34,825 --> 00:58:37,385
l understand. Jack, listen up.

282
00:58:38,028 --> 00:58:40,826
Can you identify anything around you?

283
00:58:49,105 --> 00:58:50,504
There's door to my left.

284
00:59:05,288 --> 00:59:07,984
The best guess is he's right
about here in this area,

285
00:59:08,158 --> 00:59:10,922
We break through this wall,
get us into the Control Room.

286
00:59:18,535 --> 00:59:20,765
Okay, now look, Jack,
this is very important.

287
00:59:21,037 --> 00:59:23,972
Right behind you is a wall. Behind
that wall is the Control Room.

288
00:59:24,374 --> 00:59:27,309
lf we can break through the wall,
we can buy some time.

289
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:28,934
Can you do that?

290
00:59:30,347 --> 00:59:32,110
Give it a shot.

291
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:40,387
l need 2 man upstair
Ladder 1 7

292

l wish for a Barbie.

294
01:01:54,657 --> 01:01:56,488
You're not suppose to say it loud.

295
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,993
But will l get it now?

296
01:02:08,238 --> 01:02:11,173
Sorry, l am late.
This is for the Birthday girl.

297
01:02:15,245 --> 01:02:16,507
Happy Birthday.

298
01:02:52,115 --> 01:02:54,948
Sitting here at night
watching the romantic light

299
01:02:58,388 --> 01:03:00,515
Beauty and the Beast,
it is hell of a book.

300
01:03:00,657 --> 01:03:02,386
lt's good. l never read it before.

301
01:03:04,461 --> 01:03:06,429
Have you consider
baby-sitting full time?

302
01:03:27,117 --> 01:03:28,516
Shouldn't you left by now?

303
01:03:28,618 --> 01:03:30,415
Yeah, l can't find my key.
Do you see them?

304
01:03:30,587 --> 01:03:33,021
Yeah, they're by the door
where you left them.

305
01:03:37,961 --> 01:03:40,225
Can we take

01:03:40,463 --> 01:03:44,092
Game on Saturday?
Yeah, definitely

307
01:04:03,019 --> 01:04:04,384
What is it?

308
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:06,555
lt's a tree.

309
01:06:01,237 --> 01:06:03,501
Tommy, check out downstairs.

310
01:06:28,398 --> 01:06:30,764
Okay, let's go.
Come on, come on.

311

- You find anyone?
- No, nobody.

314
01:07:01,831 --> 01:07:03,560
Get the hell out of here.

Come on, let's go, let's go.

316

We're putting you on a chopper
and take you to Gilford.

Come on, Nicky. Get upstairs

Who told you?

322
01:09:25,374 --> 01:09:27,706
Yeah, steam can burn your skin.

323
01:09:28,711 --> 01:09:30,679
New skin grows back

Yeah, when it happens.

01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:52,959
Well, we're trained not to get hurt.

328
01:09:58,841 --> 01:10:01,241
Long before you was borned,
l was trained.

329
01:10:04,247 --> 01:10:07,045
Sometimes, things can go wrong.

We're not afraid 'coz
we do it to save people.

You tell Julie Costa that Alex's dad

He's going to be okay.

You're not going to go in?

No, it's fine. You can go in now.

Don't say that.

344
01:13:08,864 --> 01:13:11,196
How does he look?

345
01:13:18,574 --> 01:13:20,735
He's in lot of pain?

346
01:13:26,582 --> 01:13:28,243
l'll like to go see him.

347
01:13:34,557 --> 01:13:36,718
Because he's our friend.

348
01:13:37,059 --> 01:13:38,686
Do what you want.

349
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:42,159
Are you telling me
you don't want me to go?

350
01:13:42,264 --> 01:13:45,324
- No, l don't want you to go.
- Why?

351
01:13:45,901 --> 01:13:47,994
'Coz you're going to see him
and you're going to freak out

352
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:50,695
There's more for you to worry about.

353
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,708
More for me to worry about or
more for you to worry about, Jack?

354
01:13:55,745 --> 01:13:57,076
Don't tell me you don't worry.

355
01:14:00,583 --> 01:14:02,050
Are you trying to pick a fight?

356
01:14:13,629 --> 01:14:17,395
Big office, secretary,
so much paper work

357
01:14:46,362 --> 01:14:48,296
What's eating you?

358
01:14:49,098 --> 01:14:51,760
Who is this?

359
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:57,331
And that is definitely not her.

360
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,640
Yeah, maybe l've to come
slide down your chimney tonight.

361
01:15:23,966 --> 01:15:26,935
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

362
01:15:33,042 --> 01:15:34,737
We got to talk.

363
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:44,317
Anything else?

364
01:16:03,305 --> 01:16:06,274
Do you still love the job
like you used to?

365
01:16:13,182 --> 01:16:15,309
You've been through a lot.
What can l say?

366
01:16:15,517 --> 01:16:17,109
You lost your best friend

367
01:16:27,162 --> 01:16:29,562
How are Linda and the kids?

368
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:41,806
When l was married, my wife
hated me being a fire fighter

369
01:16:45,648 --> 01:16:47,912
You're different,
you're a good father.

370
01:16:48,117 --> 01:16:51,245
You're worried but you should worried.

371
01:16:52,888 --> 01:16:55,652
You know, maybe the time for a change

372
01:17:01,263 --> 01:17:04,892
l was thinking there's
this job at headquarters

373
01:17:14,576 --> 01:17:16,942
You should ask yourself that question.

374
01:17:16,979 --> 01:17:18,970
You go home, talk to Linda.

375
01:17:19,415 --> 01:17:22,009
You know, be honest to yourself.

376
01:17:23,652 --> 01:17:26,052
Nothing wrong with moving on.

377
01:17:30,225 --> 01:17:32,693
So, what did he say?

378
01:17:37,766 --> 01:17:40,394
What is that mean?

379
01:17:46,642 --> 01:17:49,702
...increase in pay.

380
01:17:56,819 --> 01:17:59,083
ls that what you want?

381
01:18:15,204 --> 01:18:17,536
You know, the kids are scare.

382

You upset

383
01:18:20,642 --> 01:18:28,071
So, this is about me and
the kids again, isn't it?

384
01:18:49,772 --> 01:18:51,740
We married 10 years.

385
01:18:56,412 --> 01:18:58,403
And l do get scare.

386
01:18:58,647 --> 01:19:00,512
But l deal with it.

387
01:19:18,934 --> 01:19:21,562
lf l still love the job the way l did,

388
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:33,910
From midnight to the current hour,

389
01:21:08,677 --> 01:21:10,668
Lenny, Lenny

390
01:21:13,348 --> 01:21:15,213
l got it, l got it. Go.

391
01:21:38,607 --> 01:21:40,268
Where's your mom and dad?

392
01:21:40,409 --> 01:21:42,639
- Shopping.

393
01:21:43,779 --> 01:21:47,340
- l was with Jenny.
- Who is Jenny?

394
01:21:48,317 --> 01:21:51,184
My cousin. She was baby-sitting.

395
01:21:51,453 --> 01:21:53,751
Where do you live?
Where is your apartment? Show me.

396
01:22:50,812 --> 01:22:52,780
Hello?

397
01:23:06,795 --> 01:23:09,093
Hello? Fire department.

398
01:23:22,678 --> 01:23:27,206
Anybody here? Fire department.

399
01:26:39,674 --> 01:26:41,369
l got something.

400
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:00,626
You're bleeding.

401
01:27:01,263 --> 01:27:03,356
Let's get you treated.
Your shift is over.

402
01:31:19,788 --> 01:31:22,348
All units report to the
now.

403
01:31:48,850 --> 01:31:50,909
Jack, come in, Jack.

404
01:32:20,915 --> 01:32:23,145
The condition deteriorated rapidly.

405
01:32:23,284 --> 01:32:26,048
Ladder 49, there's a Control Room
straight ahead. Jack is in there.

406
01:32:26,221 --> 01:32:27,984
Keep going, just keep going.

407
01:32:37,999 --> 01:32:41,332
Command, stand by.
l see a door, l see a door.

408
01:32:42,303 --> 01:32:46,364
Jack, they're getting close. You just
hang on there, Jack. Just hang on.

409
01:32:57,385 --> 01:32:59,148
Jack, hold on. We're right here.

410
01:34:00,815 --> 01:34:02,510
Jack, talk to me.

411
01:34:02,917 --> 01:34:04,544
Jack, talk to me.

412
01:34:08,256 --> 01:34:09,621
Listen to me.

413
01:34:34,716 --> 01:34:37,344
Mike, tell Linda l love her.

414
01:34:43,157 --> 01:34:47,719
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah, l heard you.

415
01:35:03,211 --> 01:35:05,805
You tell them that, you hear me?

416
01:35:15,123 --> 01:35:16,556
l will.

417
01:35:39,447 --> 01:35:43,076
All units, evacuate the
building immediately.

418
01:37:51,612 --> 01:37:56,345
lt's never an easy thing saying goodbye
to your brother fire-fighter.

419
01:37:59,887 --> 01:38:04,381
And this time, particularly it's
difficult for me because l watch Jack

420
01:38:04,592 --> 01:38:10,155
Grew into well, into one of the
finest fire-fighter l've ever known.

421
01:38:11,299 --> 01:38:14,359
He join this department because
he want to help people.

422
01:38:15,903 --> 01:38:19,634
Who knows how many homes are still
standing because Jack was there.

423
01:38:19,774 --> 01:38:22,174
How many life were spared?

424
01:38:24,679 --> 01:38:27,375
He gives his life for that cause.

425
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:31,484
We'll never forget you, Jack.

426
01:38:32,587 --> 01:38:35,021
And we're better for having you.

427
01:38:39,927 --> 01:38:42,020
l make you this 1 promise,

428
01:38:42,196 --> 01:38:47,429
Tomorrow, when the bell rings,
we'll be back on the truck.

429
01:38:48,102 --> 01:38:51,196
Because you're the
bravest of the brave.

430
01:38:52,373 --> 01:38:57,912
People always asking me how the
fire-fighter run into burning building

431
01:38:57,912 --> 01:39:00,437
When everyone else is running out?

432
01:39:00,748 --> 01:39:06,152
Jack, you answer that question
by saving another man's life.

433
01:39:06,354 --> 01:39:08,879
Your courage is the answer.

434
01:39:14,295 --> 01:39:17,628
And today we will be as brave as you,

435
01:39:18,899 --> 01:39:22,960
By not mourning you
but celebrating your life.
