We were ambushed from the rear!

<i>Who was the attacker? Was it the North?</i>

00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,957
Cannot confirm, cannot confirm!

<i>Pull back to sector 31!</i>

8
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:51,083

- Leave me.
- Sir?

14
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:44,018
Just get out of here, asshole!

15
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,875
Run for the GP gate! Now!

Lt. Lee is reassigned to a desk job

after suffering a wrist injury.

21
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:34,441
There's also Lt. Shin Yoo-hwa,

22
00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:38,483
who scored highest marks
in biochemical warfare,

23
00:03:38,858 --> 00:03:41,177

00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:51,124
Sorry for bringing you
in during your training.

27
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:52,192
Sit.

28
00:03:58,275 --> 00:03:59,732
Begin right away, major.

29
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:01,108
Yes, sir.

30
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:13,442
6 am on the 14th, a search
party was ambushed.

31
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:18,108
It took place in Sector 6031km
from Southern Limit Line.

32
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:21,317
Autopsy photos, it is presumed that...

33
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:23,608
Who do you think did it?

34
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:28,150
I can't... tell for sure yet.

35
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,941
With talk of a potential summit,

36
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:33,817
a clash in the DMZ will be a headache.

37
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:39,983
I want you to lead a special
detail to find out.

38
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,025
We've already selected your team.

39
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,650
Lt. Shin is the deputy?

40
00:05:14,817 --> 00:05:16,399
That feels good.

41
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Lt. Shin.

42
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:22,066
You're the best.

43
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:23,483
That was great work.

44
00:05:32,775 --> 00:05:35,108
Really? You drank all that?

45
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:40,061
Go wash it.

46
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,691
I don't disrespect Lt. Shin,

47
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:46,899
but an experienced NCO
should take the role, sir.

48
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,066
You two went through tactical training,

49
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:52,149
and Mt. Gari infil mission.

50
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,357
This is not even main
mission, what's with you?

51
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:58,732
But if we're entering DMZ, we should...

52
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,733
What.

53
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:01,493
Is there a problem?

54
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:05,248
No, sir.

55
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:13,317
It's not fair that I got sidelined
because of this damn cast.

56
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:16,298
- When do you remove it?
- Whenever I want.

57
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:24,907
That's enough camo paint on your lips.

58
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:26,025
No bachelors in sight.

59
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:31,581
It looks like you got blood on it.

60
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:37,525
<i>Near Civilian Control Line,</i>

61
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,333
<i>dozens of dead chickens were discovered.</i>

62
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:45,357
<i>According to the locals, as
high as 20 are discovered</i>

63
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:47,774

<i>Defense Ministry has yet

65
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,025
Looks like chicken's on
our menu for a week.

66
00:06:57,966 --> 00:06:58,966
Shift change.

67
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:00,692
Lt. Shin, I'm off.

68
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:04,650
Oops, this is yours. Sorry.

69
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,937
Later, Lee Hyun-suk.

70
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:26,538
It's Sgt. Yoo.

71
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:28,858
- Come in.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:33,772
Salu...

73
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:37,733
What?

74
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,775
I thought I was in the wrong room.

75
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:45,260
How's your skin trouble?

76
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,423
I was feeling sweet tooth, thanks for this.

77
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:52,542
What's this?

78
00:07:52,895 --> 00:07:54,728
Make-up, of course.

79
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,910
Isn't that for chicks?

80
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,767
Lt. Shin.

81
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,650
Yes, sir.

82
00:08:07,376 --> 00:08:09,164
Something going on?

83
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:34,849
Salute!

84
00:08:35,117 --> 00:08:37,408
It's the list of members for the detail.

85
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:40,033
Briefing at HQ, 5 pm.

86
00:08:45,117 --> 00:08:46,158
Are you injured?

87
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:48,408
Sir?

88
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:52,325
Sir.

89
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,199
Sgt. Han, did something happen in S603?

90
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,092
Who knows, let's head inside.

91
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:15,700
How was the field training?

92
00:09:15,742 --> 00:09:17,366
No more shop talk.

93
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:18,367
Hey, Sgt. Han!

94
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:21,032
- Salute!
- Sure.

95
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:22,575
Sgt. Yoo, what brings you here?

96
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:24,033
Special detail.

97
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Cpt. Jo's?

98
00:09:25,658 --> 00:09:27,450
You too?

99
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:30,782
Am I bringing down class?

100
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:33,950
I'm used to it, Sgt. Han.

101
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:36,699
- Who's the deputy?
- Don't know.

102
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,908
I heard Master Sgt. Park is also selected.

103
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:42,238
The Grim Reaper?

104
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:46,050
So he's the deputy...

105
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:47,575
Let's find out.

106
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,074
Then I'm the junior?

107
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:53,158
Yup.

108
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,692
- Hey, kiddo.
- Pvt. Lee Jong-hui!

109
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:02,825
Have you seen a boar?

110
00:10:04,242 --> 00:10:08,199
One stared through me during a drill,

111
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,408
- but my swift kick...
- I've been looking all over.

112
00:10:10,992 --> 00:10:15,367
You must report to HQ for S603 detail ASAP.

113
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,927
Private, do your best, you'll be fine.

114
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:22,342
What are you talking about?

115
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:24,450
It's you, petty officer.

116
00:10:24,598 --> 00:10:26,140
- Me?
- Yes.

117
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,038
I'm not falling for that again.

118
00:10:29,283 --> 00:10:30,992
I did my duty.

119
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:32,825
Take care!

120
00:10:33,587 --> 00:10:35,879
That chump...

121
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:41,023
Kiddo, I'll read this order form for you.

122
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:46,325
<i>Mission Order Name: PO Roh Il-kwon</i>

123
00:10:54,408 --> 00:10:57,325
We've just crossed S883.

124
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:17,932
Let's introduce ourselves.

125
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:21,517
I'm Lt. Shin Yoo-hwa, deputy
chief of this detail.

126
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:24,558
Sgt. Han Seung-ho from
sector 3 infil squad.

127
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,182
Good to see you.

128
00:11:27,183 --> 00:11:29,350
I'm in Sgt. Yoo's year, please be at ease.

129
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:35,642
I serve with Lt. Shin, Sgt.
Yoo of sniper squad.

130
00:11:38,725 --> 00:11:40,682
Staff Sgt. Gu Yoon-gil from sector 3.

131
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:44,539
I heard you were 1st in
ATT drill, am I correct?

132
00:11:44,564 --> 00:11:45,564
Yes, ma'am.

133
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,933
And you?

134
00:11:53,058 --> 00:11:54,600
- Salute!
- Salute!

135
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:55,767
Salute!

136
00:11:55,892 --> 00:11:56,892
Salute!

137
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:01,933
Shin Yoo-hwa...

138
00:12:03,454 --> 00:12:05,329
- Colonel.
- Come in.

139
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:10,433
We have no idea what happened in 603,

140
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,892
or why the entire search party was killed.

141
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:19,063
We must uncover the truth
and eliminate the threat.

142
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:24,683
We deploy at 0600, when
GP 426's shift ends,

143
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:27,724
until next patrol unit reports at 0600.

144
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:29,891
Exactly 24 hours.

145
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:32,058
If we're entering DMZ,

146
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:34,599
what's our rules of engagement?

147
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,267
We must avoid skirmish, so
ROE is limited at best.

148
00:12:37,678 --> 00:12:41,345
And as such, minimize your gear.

149
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:45,058
- Check the gear.
- Yes, sir!

150
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,835
Salute!

151
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,779
This is a covert op, so
light-weight loadout,

152
00:13:01,892 --> 00:13:04,642
and silencers are mandatory.

153
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:06,808
- Sgt. Yoo.
- Yes, ma'am.

154
00:13:07,142 --> 00:13:09,725
Add M18 smoke grenade to the list.

155
00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:12,558
The smoke grenade?

156
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:13,558
Prepare it.

157
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:15,866
Any other required gear, ma'am?

158
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,501
- That is all.
- Yes, ma'am.

159
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:19,835
For this detail,

160
00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:23,850
remove all insignias and unit badges.

161
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,578
Assemble at staging area,
0500 tomorrow, dismissed.

162
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:35,788
Yes, sweetie.

163
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:37,058
A gun?!

164
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:44,308
Salute!

165
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:48,813
Sweetie, girls should have ballet...

166
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:53,058
Okay, I'll head home early,
so have dinner with granny.

167
00:13:58,017 --> 00:13:59,017
Salute!

168
00:13:59,683 --> 00:14:01,225
Sir, please head out early.

169
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,000
I'll prep the loadout fit for the mission.

170
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,642
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

171
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:14,267
Where can I buy realistic replica guns?

172
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:16,291
Sir?

173
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:18,183
No, I don't...

174
00:14:22,892 --> 00:14:24,433
She wants a gun...

175
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,392
My daughter...

176
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:33,807
I'm off, prep properly.

177
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:34,267
- Yes sir!
- Salute!

178
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:35,267
Salute!

179
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,127
I did not expect that from him.

180
00:14:58,017 --> 00:14:59,142
Kiddo.

181
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:04,744
How long till your discharge?

182
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:07,558
20 days, sir.

183
00:15:09,017 --> 00:15:12,350
Only 20 days left, but you volunteered?

184
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:14,392
Sir?

185
00:15:14,558 --> 00:15:17,849
- We got a hero.
- That's not it.

186
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,694
I was the chief's radioman during training,

187
00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:24,850
I guess I was assigned because of it.

188
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:26,475
Assigned, eh?

189
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:28,609
How old are you?

190
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,975
25, sir.

191
00:15:31,558 --> 00:15:33,100
That means...

192
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,216
he's older than you.

193
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:41,267
Stay frosty.

194
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:43,142
- Let's go.
- Okay, I'm off.

195
00:15:56,818 --> 00:15:59,795
Kiddo, no mistakes.

196
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,616
Salute!

197
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:27,931
They've been briefed.

198
00:16:30,617 --> 00:16:33,158
I will not disappoint you for selecting
me...

199
00:16:33,183 --> 00:16:34,736
I did not select you.

200
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,408
You weren't my choice.

201
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:48,142
You're not fit for this detail.

202
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:50,683
No prior DMZ experience.

203
00:16:51,392 --> 00:16:54,892
Shin, it's not too late to bail.

204
00:17:00,808 --> 00:17:02,844
I'll see you at the staging area!

205
00:17:03,017 --> 00:17:04,243
Salute!

206
00:17:19,857 --> 00:17:23,899
Cpt. Jo was an elite since he was a cadet,

207
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:27,350
so I understand fully why
he was picked to lead.

208
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:33,183
But why overlook Sgt. Park and
assign you as his deputy?

209
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,777
Hey!

210
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:36,475
You called me out to tell me that?

211
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:39,283
Lieutenant, this is live combat.

212
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,200
Frankly, what can a woman do in there?

213
00:17:42,225 --> 00:17:44,722
You can't do much, and it's bug haven.

214
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:47,308
I washed this today.

215
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:54,368
Your birthday's in 2 days,
I got you a present...

216
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:00,683
That sass of hers...

217
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:08,180
Lt. Shin!

218
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:10,224
Come with me!

220
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:06,533
Is everything here?

221
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:07,798
Yes, Sgt. Yoo.

222
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:27,193
You have exactly 24 hours
to complete this mission.

223
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:29,166
Yes, sir!

224
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:34,186
Roll out.

225
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:59,349
Passing through S532.

226
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,850
Passing through S532.

227
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:03,516
Requesting mobile eye check.

228
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:07,933
Poor signal, ending transmission, over.

229
00:20:09,017 --> 00:20:10,725
Here, chew.

230
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:13,885
I don't chew gum before breakfast, sir.

231
00:20:20,475 --> 00:20:21,977
We all had breakfast.

232
00:20:22,183 --> 00:20:23,558
Who told you to skip?

233
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:26,575
Become one with the unit.

234
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,814
Deputy chief.

235
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:38,462
This won't cause skin
trouble, it's top class.

236
00:20:44,017 --> 00:20:45,350
30 minutes out.

237
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,682
So you're asking me to
check the radio signal...

238
00:20:59,683 --> 00:21:00,225
Salute!

239
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:04,350
Between war room and admin
HQ, but why should I?!

240
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:06,975
I'm sorry, sir. At once!

241
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,892
Why am I doing petty chores?

242
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:12,730
Major's gonna bitch at me.

243
00:21:18,428 --> 00:21:21,803
Cameras are attached to their boonie hats.

244
00:21:25,142 --> 00:21:26,367
What the hell?

245
00:21:26,392 --> 00:21:26,975
Salute!

246
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:29,391
This is a restricted room,
get the hell out, asshole!

247
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:30,392
Sorry, sir...

248
00:21:34,881 --> 00:21:36,714
I'm sorry for that, colonel.

254
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,875
GP, seal the gate and don't let anyone in.

255
00:22:34,214 --> 00:22:37,923
3 members of covert ops
disguised as search party

256
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:42,858
are confirmed dead and
rest are still missing.

257
00:22:44,692 --> 00:22:47,983
This op may need to be
covered up on my end.

258
00:22:49,717 --> 00:22:51,467
That's right, commander.

259
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,962
Lt. Choi, it's the
Milltary Demarcation Line.

260
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:10,837
Cross.

261
00:23:22,704 --> 00:23:25,292
- It's quite eerie here.
- Right?

262
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:27,542
Is there anything you want for your b-day?

263
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:30,179
So that's the good news.

264
00:23:31,225 --> 00:23:33,434
How about a decent man, deputy?

265
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:35,147
No more small talks.

266
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:36,358
Yes, ma'am.

267
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:46,951

00:23:55,817 --> 00:23:57,427
- You okay?
- Yeah.

269
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:20,775

270
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:22,751

Or at least send me a memo.

276
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:02,201
The radio's on, but what am I to do?

277
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,900

280
00:26:03,947 --> 00:26:05,753

00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:08,794
<i>Potential target!</i>

282
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:29,401
Keep your eyes peeled.

283
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,508
Did you see it right?

284
00:26:57,292 --> 00:26:59,750
Adjusting recon route to 10 o'clock.

285
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,542
Something's here.

286
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:31,417
If hostiles are spotted,
cut off its retreat.

287
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:12,125
Chief, Sgt. Han has broken off.

288
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:14,375
Sgt. Han!

289
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:17,843
Sgt. Han? Sgt. Han?

290
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,500
Initiating search.

00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:43,417
Report continuously!

296
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,473
Yoo, follow me.

297
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:27,525
I'll debrief when everyone
reports back, over.

298
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:32,625
We were thorough, but we found nothing.

299
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:36,191
No sign of hostiles.

300
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,776
Chief, it was the North for sure.

301
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:41,188
We must tread carefully.

302
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,869
It's floating grass from the swamp.

303
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:51,807
We must investigate.

304
00:29:57,288 --> 00:30:00,371
See? It was on.

305
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:20,003
<i>As we expected, there was a detour.</i>

306
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:22,725
<i>But they're in pursuit of the target.</i>

307
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,292
<i>At current situation,</i>

308
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:29,750
we can't disregard the fact
that all team may perish.

309
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,117
<i>Yes, don't worry sir.</i>

310
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:04,267
We're on a tight schedule, you
can't just jump into a swamp.

311
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:05,794
Master Sergeant...

312
00:31:06,475 --> 00:31:07,475

<i>14 hours until the end of mission</i>

Dragging stopped here.

319
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:08,718
Do not touch anything until further notice.

320
00:32:09,437 --> 00:32:10,437
Yes, ma'am.

321
00:32:16,762 --> 00:32:17,832
Chief!

322
00:32:18,796 --> 00:32:20,124
It's Han's glove...

323
00:32:24,661 --> 00:32:28,386
You're free to fire at hostiles.

324
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:48,800

325
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,662
Secure the swamp.

00:33:35,643 --> 00:33:37,108
Body discovered.

327
00:33:37,328 --> 00:33:39,495

330
00:33:45,883 --> 00:33:47,592
Nest, nest, this is eagle.

331
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,342
7 bodies found in S301 on SLL, over.

332
00:33:52,592 --> 00:33:56,736
5 bodies are North Koreans
and 2 presumed allies.

333
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:04,424
<i>Provoked by the North? Where
did the target attack from?</i>

334
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:07,277
<i>Secure the open area, and continue pursuit.</i>

335
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:08,525
Copy that.

336
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,707
Over.

337
00:34:13,383 --> 00:34:15,550
- This is Sgt. Lee!
- Don't touch!

338
00:34:19,342 --> 00:34:21,967
One of the bodies is Lee
from the search party.

339
00:34:22,633 --> 00:34:24,900
Resume pursuit, flank the swamp.

340
00:34:24,925 --> 00:34:25,983

Chief!

343
00:34:51,475 --> 00:34:52,100
Sir!

344
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:54,400
2 of those bodies are
from the search party.

345
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,552
Isn't finding them our primary objective?

346
00:35:00,955 --> 00:35:02,997
Mission objective remains the same.

347
00:35:03,175 --> 00:35:06,257
We evac after rescuing Han
and eliminating the target.

348
00:35:06,258 --> 00:35:08,592
Potential biochemical target was sighted.

349
00:35:08,716 --> 00:35:11,849
Rescuing Han is our priority, move!

350
00:35:17,342 --> 00:35:20,050
Even if they find the deserted bunker,

351
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:25,258
we sealed it tight back in 2000.

352
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:29,217
Yes, don't worry, commander.

353
00:35:35,373 --> 00:35:37,275
Why are you here, asshole!

354
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,358
How did you get in here!

355
00:35:39,383 --> 00:35:40,943
I crawled in.

356
00:35:41,842 --> 00:35:44,637
Since when? What did you hear?

357
00:35:46,045 --> 00:35:47,483
What's all this?

358
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:50,442
Do you send in your men
knowing that they'll die?

359
00:35:50,467 --> 00:35:52,329
- Tell me!
- Son of a bitch!

360
00:35:58,976 --> 00:36:01,358
- Pull him out!
- Let go of me!

361
00:36:01,383 --> 00:36:03,162
Let go!

362
00:36:13,117 --> 00:36:14,983
Lt. Shin, can you hear me?!

363
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:16,924
<i>Evac now! You'll die there!</i>

364
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:21,049
MS2 bateriophage, you'll die, pull out now!

365
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,217
The colonel is...

366
00:36:23,092 --> 00:36:24,689
Do you copy?

367
00:36:28,717 --> 00:36:29,717
Chief!

368
00:36:30,826 --> 00:36:32,909
I heard an order for evac, and a gunshot.

369
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,228
What? Radio in.

370
00:36:35,842 --> 00:36:36,967
Nest, nest...

371
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:40,757
No signal.

372
00:36:42,008 --> 00:36:44,450
Chief, the sample from the swamp

373
00:36:44,475 --> 00:36:46,975
is showing positive reaction to nervine.

374
00:36:47,592 --> 00:36:49,467
It's a confirmation of mutation.

375
00:36:52,341 --> 00:36:56,882
Tell us what's really going on here.

376
00:37:03,692 --> 00:37:06,858
Regardless of the mutation,
and the war room gunshot,

377
00:37:06,883 --> 00:37:09,175
our primary objective is
to eliminate the target,

378
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,684
and evac with Sgt. Han.

379
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:12,834
Was I excluded

380
00:37:14,383 --> 00:37:17,191
from any necessary intel?

381
00:37:17,898 --> 00:37:18,440
What?

382
00:37:18,465 --> 00:37:21,173
The target we're pursuing may not be human.

383
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:22,459
Something unimaginable...

384
00:37:22,484 --> 00:37:26,318
That does not change our main objective.

385
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:35,592
No, which is why I'm bringing this up.

386
00:37:35,842 --> 00:37:37,842
What the hell is going on?!

387
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:43,175
I didn't come here just to die,
tell us everything you know.

388
00:37:45,842 --> 00:37:50,175
If you're scared, evac to the GP gate!

389
00:38:09,842 --> 00:38:11,925
4 o'clock, source of the blast.

390
00:38:12,717 --> 00:38:13,717
Move.

391
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:43,050
<i>11 hours until the end of mission</i>

392
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:02,467
Chief, a bunker sighted at 3 o'clock.

393
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,008
Radio!

394
00:39:07,092 --> 00:39:08,092
2-1, 2-1.

395
00:39:09,425 --> 00:39:11,925
Sir, comm signal is dropping.

396
00:39:13,592 --> 00:39:15,095
Check team comm too.

397
00:39:15,925 --> 00:39:16,965
2-1, 2-1.

398
00:39:19,508 --> 00:39:21,967
There's radio interference
surrounding this area.

399
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:24,508
Get off comm.

400
00:39:26,258 --> 00:39:30,216
Our target and Han are
likely inside the bunker

401
00:39:30,217 --> 00:39:31,717
considering all circumstances.

402
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:35,633
We'll move in and eliminate.

403
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,800
Chief.

404
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:39,342
We must stay on our recon route, sir.

405
00:39:42,383 --> 00:39:45,879
There's no actionable intel
that the target is inside.

406
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,910
Attention.

407
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:55,175
State your opinions.

408
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,508
If you wish to evac, you
have my permission.

409
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:02,967
I'll take the heat.

410
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:05,165
How can we leave Han behind!

411
00:40:16,258 --> 00:40:17,725
Let's do it.

412
00:40:18,175 --> 00:40:22,300
Like he said, let's get Han
and kill everything in there.

413
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:26,383
Park and I will take point,

414
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,633
deputy and Roh take the flank.

415
00:40:29,967 --> 00:40:33,508
Rest of you cover the rear.

416
00:40:34,592 --> 00:40:35,706
Chief.

417
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:39,883
Please put Roh on rear
and I'll take his place.

418
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:50,550
Yoo, are you okay?

419
00:40:52,758 --> 00:40:55,092
Sure, no problem.

420
00:41:23,425 --> 00:41:27,000
They're entering the bunker that
Ministry of Defense sealed.

421
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:50,250
There is a blood trail.

422
00:42:51,258 --> 00:42:53,496
We have to investigate.

423
00:44:12,425 --> 00:44:14,092
Drop your gun.

424
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,956
Now!

425
00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:48,224
Order your team to come out.

426
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:57,133
Come on out!

427
00:45:02,217 --> 00:45:07,133
Sons of traitors, one slip
and you'll go to hell.

428
00:45:10,492 --> 00:45:13,407
Wanna see them die?!

429
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,679
Under attack!

430
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:44,112
Retrieve your weapon and confirm location!

431
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,181
Kill every last one of them!

432
00:45:54,425 --> 00:45:56,342
Roh, provide cover!

433
00:46:02,925 --> 00:46:04,050
Yoo!

434
00:46:16,383 --> 00:46:18,592
Roh, get out of here!

435
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:29,055
Chief!

436
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:31,859
Master Sergeant! Cover fire!

437
00:46:57,745 --> 00:46:59,037
Retreat.

438
00:47:17,038 --> 00:47:18,788
Yoo! Cover the rear!

439
00:47:39,509 --> 00:47:41,112
Sgt. Yoo...

440
00:47:46,062 --> 00:47:47,537
Sgt. Yoo...

441
00:47:54,787 --> 00:47:58,113
Gu, get out of here...

442
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:09,254
Follow me.

443
00:48:11,971 --> 00:48:13,804
2-1, 2-1?

444
00:48:16,414 --> 00:48:17,550
Comm's down...

445
00:48:17,575 --> 00:48:19,575
<i>How the hell are you managing this?</i>

446
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:20,771
My apologies, sir.

447
00:48:21,533 --> 00:48:22,824
<i>What's the post-op plan?</i>

448
00:48:25,326 --> 00:48:27,993
Biochemical specialist is part of the op,

449
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:32,349
I'll make sure this doesn't reach you.

450
00:48:33,834 --> 00:48:35,057
Yes, sir.

451
00:48:38,284 --> 00:48:43,743
<i>5 hours until the end of mission</i>

452
00:48:46,058 --> 00:48:48,850
Colonel! All comms and
video feeds are down.

453
00:48:51,975 --> 00:48:53,952
I'll go in myself.

454
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,225
Have a squad ready.

455
00:48:58,933 --> 00:48:59,933
Yes, sir.

456
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:20,498
We have to find our men at once!

457
00:49:51,608 --> 00:49:53,177
Sgt. Yoo?

458
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,013
What the...

459
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:10,615
What caused this?

460
00:50:27,209 --> 00:50:28,758
Let's go back.

461
00:50:29,142 --> 00:50:34,523
Look for survivors and secure a radio.

462
00:50:58,209 --> 00:50:59,209
Chief...

463
00:51:42,617 --> 00:51:43,617
Roh?

464
00:51:44,157 --> 00:51:45,778
Sgt. Gu?

465
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:54,695
Where's the chief?

466
00:51:55,785 --> 00:51:57,702
Weren't you with him?

467
00:51:59,058 --> 00:52:02,367
The radio was hit during the firefight.

468
00:52:02,711 --> 00:52:04,139
What?

469
00:52:04,517 --> 00:52:07,053
What'll happen to us now?

470
00:52:39,663 --> 00:52:41,157
Sgt. Yoo!

471
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:43,844
Yoo!

472
00:52:48,424 --> 00:52:51,290
Stay awake, please!

473
00:52:52,982 --> 00:52:54,107
Lieutenant.

474
00:53:01,339 --> 00:53:02,817
It's...

475
00:53:05,214 --> 00:53:06,923
too cold here.

476
00:53:08,408 --> 00:53:10,074
Sergeant!

477
00:53:12,107 --> 00:53:13,664
What about Gu?

478
00:53:16,767 --> 00:53:17,767
Sergeant...

479
00:53:45,642 --> 00:53:48,225
<i>1 hour until the end of mission</i>

480
00:54:32,646 --> 00:54:34,198
Only an hour...

481
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,600
until evac.

482
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:46,748
When you encounter this unidentified being,

483
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,416
will you be able to

484
00:54:49,441 --> 00:54:53,691
