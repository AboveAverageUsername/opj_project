They want to go celebrate, right?

166
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:05,466
B.P.D., DEA, l want tips,
names, witnesses, anything.

167
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:08,668
We're gonna knock on some doors,
see who wants to help us out.

168
00:13:08,832 --> 00:13:11,871
Any questions? No? Great. Let's go.

169
00:13:18,175 --> 00:13:19,444
What's going on, pal?

170
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:20,711
What up?

171
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:22,212
Hey, there he is.

172
00:13:22,378 --> 00:13:23,580
DOUG: Boom.
JEM: Sober Jackson.

173
00:13:23,747 --> 00:13:25,716
DOUG: What's up?
-Hey, hey. Krista's here.

174
00:13:27,084 --> 00:13:28,419
JEM:
Go on, tell the story.

175
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:32,024
GLOANS: Dougy, sit down. l'm trying to tell
these motherfuckers about your father.

176
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:35,027
The feds will never understand
the guy who's facing 40 years.

177
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:38,698
Gonna give him the opportunity
to walk scot-free if he gives up his friends.

178
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,931
He tells them,
''Suck a dick. Give me the 40.''

179
00:13:41,097 --> 00:13:42,199
JEM:
''Fucking suck a dick.''

180
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:45,402
Yeah, well, here's to Big Mac.

181
00:13:46,268 --> 00:13:47,570
Doing his time like a man.

182
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:50,708
JEM: That's right.
GLOANS: Last crew in Charlestown.

183
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,342
DOUG:
l'm gonna get a tonic, l guess.

184
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:54,477
All right.
Get me an umbrella for my beer.

185
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:58,115
Let me get a Shirley Temple
with an extra cherry, please.

186
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,452
Poor fucking sober bastard.

187
00:14:05,086 --> 00:14:07,390
-Thanks.
BARTENDER: No problem.

188
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,928
Juice?

189
00:14:14,095 --> 00:14:16,332
Yeah. Juice.

190
00:14:16,864 --> 00:14:18,801
Do you want some snappers
to go with that?

191
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:21,604
-What are you doing?
-l was just playing.

192
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:23,539
Fuck.

193
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:26,541
My drink.

194
00:14:31,478 --> 00:14:33,915
Heard you got in a fight, Kris.

195
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:36,751
Do l look like l got in a fight?

196
00:14:37,385 --> 00:14:40,022
l don't know. Let me see.
They pull your hoop out?

197
00:14:40,187 --> 00:14:41,222
That's right.

198
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:44,495
Fucking Somalian started talking shit
when l was with my daughter.

199
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:47,362
-You were with Shyne?
-All they see are yuppies down here.

200
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:50,499
They think there's no more serious
white people in Charlestown.

201
00:14:50,663 --> 00:14:52,833
So they can fucking talk shit?

202
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,669
No.

203
00:14:56,636 --> 00:14:58,406
Well, do you miss it?

204
00:14:58,571 --> 00:15:01,242
Fucking coke and Oxy
and all that shit? Yeah, l miss it.

205
00:15:03,075 --> 00:15:06,114
We smoked it to the filter, right?

206
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:09,751
You know what l miss?

207
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:20,527
There you go.

208
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:22,328
There you go.

209
00:15:23,228 --> 00:15:24,931
That's what you want, right?

210
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,169
-Yeah.
-ls that what you want?

211
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:32,372
-Say you love it.
-Oh, fuck.

212
00:15:39,211 --> 00:15:41,214
Good night.

213
00:16:05,702 --> 00:16:07,237
WOMAN:
l'm grateful to be here today.

214
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:11,177
Growing up in Charlestown in,
you know, a small-knit community...

215
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:13,445
...we took care of each other,
were protected.

216
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:15,512
MAN 1: My friends were really
like my family.

217
00:16:15,677 --> 00:16:18,115
MAN _: l'm ashamed of the things l done
when l'm out there.

218
00:16:18,314 --> 00:16:20,217
l don't know
where l learned these things.

219
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:23,522
WOMAN: Seven years went by,
and l'd watch Christmas, birthdays--

220
00:16:23,685 --> 00:16:25,455
l didn't know what my son looked like.

221
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:27,624
MAN 1 :
Make a fast buck ifwe had to...

222
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:32,130
...that progressed
into getting arrested, and....

223
00:16:32,294 --> 00:16:36,001
The struggle that you have within yourself,
the loss, you know what l mean?

224
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:40,238
The disappointment in yourself. The anger
that turns into disappointment. The despair.

225
00:16:40,402 --> 00:16:43,241
lt's like the guy sitting in the bar,
and a priest walks in.

226
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:44,940
The guy says, ''Hey, wait a minute.

227
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:49,314
l hate to tell you this, don't waste your
time, but l happen to know there's no God.''

228
00:16:49,478 --> 00:16:51,147
The priest says, ''Yeah, how's that?''

229
00:16:51,312 --> 00:16:54,651
The guy says,
''l was an explorer in the North Pole.

230
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:58,254
l got caught in a blinding storm once.
Freezing. l was blinded.

231
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:02,025
Freezing to death. And l prayed,
'lf there's a God, save me now#

232
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,691
Now, God didn't come.''

233
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:07,564
And the priest says, you know, ''How's
that? You're alive. He must've saved you.''

234
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,229
He says, ''God never showed up.

235
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:13,437
An Eskimo came along.
Took me back to his camp and saved me.''

236
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,638
That's Janice. She's my wife
and she's sitting right there.

237
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,707
She's my Eskimo.

238
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:08,953
-How you doing?
MAN: Hey.

239
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:44,853
CLAIRE:
Excuse me?

240
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:47,258
Are you doing laundry?

241
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:49,892
Huh?

242
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:52,863
l just wondered if you had any change.
The machine is out.

243
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,800
-Can't help you. Sorry.
-Okay.

244
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,703
l can just hang them up
when l get home.

245
00:19:30,797 --> 00:19:32,300
You all right?

246
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,137
l'm fine. l'm just--

247
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:36,938
Are you sure?

248
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:42,376
You okay?

249
00:19:42,976 --> 00:19:46,449
Yeah, l'm fine. l'm fine, thank you.
l'm fine, yeah.

250
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:48,350
Well, this is embarrassing.

251
00:19:48,515 --> 00:19:50,986
No, you got nothing
to be embarrassed for.

252
00:19:52,785 --> 00:19:54,788
Do you need help?

253
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:57,459
l'm just having a bad week.

254
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:01,395
l understand.

255
00:20:02,696 --> 00:20:04,966
l like to have a good cry
at the nail salon.

256
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,641
Just open right up to the ladies.
They're very understanding.

257
00:20:11,803 --> 00:20:14,942
But, you know,
you like the Laundromat, so that's fine.

258
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:25,387
Hey, why don't you let me
buy you a drink.

259
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,022
Make up for letting you down
with the quarters.

260
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:30,790
You know, see if we can turn
your week around.

261
00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:33,592
What's the worst that could happen?

262
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,061
DINO:
f_l! Open the door!

263
00:20:35,393 --> 00:20:36,661
Open the door!

264
00:20:39,263 --> 00:20:40,599
HENRY:
Fuck.

265
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:47,939
Fuck.

266
00:20:48,105 --> 00:20:50,108
Fucking cocksucker. Get off him.

267
00:21:03,453 --> 00:21:04,823
Jesus Christ, Henry.

268
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,692
Oxy, guns?

269
00:21:08,491 --> 00:21:10,094
lt's like townie Christmas.

270
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:16,701
Minimum federal sentencing,
10 years.

271
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:20,737
You're gonna need a friend.

272
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:24,676
And she ain't it.

273
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:29,314
Great girl, though.
She really loves you, l can tell.

274
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:33,451
Good news for you is you have an alibi
for the Cambridge job.

275
00:21:33,615 --> 00:21:37,389
The good news for me
is l bet you know something about it.

276
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,857
Everyone does trucks.

277
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,760
These guys beat the alarm
for the vault.

278
00:21:44,258 --> 00:21:45,961
-Yeah?
HENRY: It's what l heard.

279
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:49,868
A kid, he gets into the junction box.

280
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:00,643
DOUG: There she is.
-Hey.

281
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:03,312
DOUG: All set?
-Yes.

282
00:22:06,012 --> 00:22:08,316
l should have come
get your door for you, huh?

283
00:22:08,481 --> 00:22:11,420
What kind of a guy lets you open
your own door like that?

284
00:22:13,753 --> 00:22:14,988
What?

285
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:17,825
l have to get something out there...

286
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,464
...otherwise l'll be pretending
to listen to you all night...

287
00:22:21,628 --> 00:22:24,132
...when really l'm thinking about
something else.

288
00:22:25,532 --> 00:22:26,567
Okay.

289
00:22:29,335 --> 00:22:31,772
A few days ago my bank was robbed.

290
00:22:31,937 --> 00:22:35,476
Four men took it over
and opened the safe.

291
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,914
They took me as a hostage.

292
00:22:40,546 --> 00:22:43,350
They blindfolded me
and drove me around.

293
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:48,657
And then they stopped and let me out
over at the beach and....

294
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:53,327
And one of the guys told me...

295
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:57,299
...to walk until l felt the water
on my toes.

296
00:22:58,696 --> 00:23:02,570
lt was the longest walk of my life.
l kept thinking l'd step off a cliff.

297
00:23:06,871 --> 00:23:09,208
And then l felt the water.

298
00:23:12,075 --> 00:23:13,945
l'm sorry.

299
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:16,881
lt's not your fault.

300
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:22,990
Anyway, the FBl guy told me
it would feel like l was in mourning.

301
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,258
FBl? You're working with the FBl?

302
00:23:26,423 --> 00:23:27,858
Mm-hm.

303
00:23:28,592 --> 00:23:30,528
What does that mean?

304
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:34,466
Guy comes by, checks in on you,
gives you a call? That kind of thing?

305
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,200
Pretty much.

306
00:23:36,934 --> 00:23:40,573
They don't have any suspects?
Any clues? Any leads? Anything like that?

307
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,340
l don't know.
Not that they've told me.

308
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:46,310
He intimated that they were
scouring Charlestown...

309
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:50,983
...but they were wearing masks, so....

310
00:23:51,614 --> 00:23:53,985
-Shit.
-Mm.

311
00:23:55,483 --> 00:23:58,789
l'm sure l'd recognize their voices
if l heard them again.

312
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:03,160
l don't know,
might be harder than you think.

313
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:07,664
So, what do you do for work?

314
00:24:09,631 --> 00:24:10,899
Boston Sand and Gravel.

315
00:24:11,065 --> 00:24:14,070
l break rocks.
Punch a ticket at the end of the day...

316
00:24:14,234 --> 00:24:17,106
...slide down the back of a brontosaurus
like Fred Flintstone.

317
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:18,373
Call it a night.

318
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:21,610
-Can l ask you something?
-You sure can.

319
00:24:21,775 --> 00:24:24,247
l volunteer at the Boys & Girls Club
in Charlestown--

320
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:25,579
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

321
00:24:25,746 --> 00:24:29,687
As a kickball pitcher since they haven't
been able to afford any ice for the rink.

322
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,521
Embarrassing. City won't put
any money into that place.

323
00:24:32,686 --> 00:24:36,492
Yeah, l know. Yeah, well, some of the kids
were calling me a toonie.

324
00:24:37,023 --> 00:24:40,663
lt just means a yuppie. Someone who's
not from Charlestown, that's all.

325
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:44,135
-Of course it does.
-They're just being punks.

326
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:52,877
BARTENDER: Hey, Jem. How's it going?
JEM: Hey, B. Can l have a beer? Thanks.

327
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,141
DOUG: Oh, shit.
-What up?

328
00:24:54,307 --> 00:24:57,746
-How you doing?
-All right. Sox got rocked.

329
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,983
What's going on?

330
00:25:05,485 --> 00:25:07,522
You, uh, check on that thing?

331
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:08,789
What?

332
00:25:08,955 --> 00:25:11,092
The license.

333
00:25:12,257 --> 00:25:15,096
-Yeah.
-And?

334
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,299
Nothing. It's a dead end. We're all set.

335
00:25:19,097 --> 00:25:21,734
So no need to remove her
from the equation?

336
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:25,306
-What?
-You heard me.

337
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:28,542
What are you, a triggerman now?

338
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,843
Just loose ends, kid.

339
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,017
You're gonna get the fucking electric
chair brought back over to Charlestown.

340
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,517
Don't be so goddamned panicked,
all right, Dig Dug?

341
00:25:38,682 --> 00:25:41,854
Just, you know, l don't wanna get
backdoored, that's all.

342
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,891
-We're fine. All right?
-All right. We're fine.

343
00:25:45,057 --> 00:25:47,361
-Okay.
-We're fine.

344
00:25:49,827 --> 00:25:51,931
MAN: They obviously know
how to work the box.

345
00:25:52,095 --> 00:25:56,136
But l like the way they zapped the BPT
to the D-5 station.

346
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:58,436
How does one learn how to do that?

347
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:01,639
Get a job at Vericom.

348
00:26:01,805 --> 00:26:04,443
-Okay.
-Thank you.

349
00:26:05,842 --> 00:26:08,314
All right, let's subpoena work logs,
employee records.

350
00:26:08,478 --> 00:26:10,481
Start with everybody
who lives in the town.

351
00:26:10,647 --> 00:26:12,082
Got it.

352
00:26:12,515 --> 00:26:13,850
CLAIRE:
l lied to the F8l.

353
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,686
DOUG:
What?

354
00:26:17,053 --> 00:26:18,555
CLAIRE:
When the guy attacked David...

355
00:26:18,721 --> 00:26:21,292
...l could see the back of his neck
and he had a tattoo.

356
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:24,827
Of what?

357
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,432
lt was one of those
Fighting Irish tattoos.

358
00:26:28,597 --> 00:26:31,134
l'm afraid if l report it
they'll make me testify.

359
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,671
What do you think l should do?

360
00:26:37,171 --> 00:26:39,341
Tell the FBl.

361
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:43,648
lf the guy's got a record,
and l'm sure he does...

362
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:46,449
...they'll have his tattoos on file.

363
00:26:46,747 --> 00:26:48,917
They'll ring him up the next day.

364
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:52,088
Robbery, weapons. He'll get 30 years.

365
00:26:52,253 --> 00:26:55,792
Course, they'll worry someone's
gonna come looking for the witness.

366
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,831
The FBl will probably want to put you in
WITSEC, you know, Witness Security.

367
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:04,068
You know, they'll probably put you
somewhere, like, you know, in Cleveland...

368
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:06,435
...or Arizona, you know,
somewhere safe.

369
00:27:08,702 --> 00:27:10,105
Or...

370
00:27:10,437 --> 00:27:12,240
...you could wait.

371
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:16,176
You have a card.

372
00:27:17,043 --> 00:27:19,380
There's nothing says you gotta play it
right away.

373
00:27:19,546 --> 00:27:22,651
You're the one who's vulnerable
in this situation right now.

374
00:27:23,116 --> 00:27:25,653
The FBl are just people
like anyone else.

375
00:27:25,818 --> 00:27:28,823
They wanna find the bad guy so they
can go home and nuke their supper.

376
00:27:28,988 --> 00:27:32,060
You have to look out
for yourself, Claire.

377
00:27:34,026 --> 00:27:35,662
Quite an expert.

378
00:27:37,663 --> 00:27:39,232
Not really.

379
00:27:40,766 --> 00:27:42,068
Just watch a lot of TV.

380
00:27:42,968 --> 00:27:44,938
l watch a lot of CSl.

381
00:27:45,104 --> 00:27:48,109
So l'm a really big expert
on all this. l know.

382
00:27:48,273 --> 00:27:51,679
And Miami CSl and New York CSl.

383
00:27:51,843 --> 00:27:53,713
All of them, l watch.

384
00:27:53,878 --> 00:27:55,213
You'll be well-prepared.

385
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,782
And Bones.

386
00:28:00,151 --> 00:28:05,962
Do we know each other well enough for
me to say that this truck is a little much?

387
00:28:06,124 --> 00:28:07,259
lt's my work truck.

388
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:10,596
lf you have problems with your Prius
l can throw it in the back.

389
00:28:10,761 --> 00:28:12,764
How did you know l had a Prius?

390
00:28:15,365 --> 00:28:18,771
Took a guess.
l mean, it just seemed like a toonie car.

391
00:28:18,936 --> 00:28:20,773
-Why, do you really have a Prius?
-Yeah.

392
00:28:20,938 --> 00:28:23,309
-Really?
-l had a Prius.

393
00:28:23,472 --> 00:28:26,477
-lt got vandalized, of course.
-What happened?

394
00:28:26,642 --> 00:28:30,016
Doesn't matter. Now l'm forced to walk
a mile through the projects.

395
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,553
-There were these guys and they started....
-What?

396
00:28:33,716 --> 00:28:36,588
l'm not sure if it was the same guys
who trashed my car, but--

397
00:28:36,752 --> 00:28:40,258
They started getting, you know--
It started with yelling when l walked by...

398
00:28:40,423 --> 00:28:42,660
...and then it got
really aggressive and....

399
00:28:42,825 --> 00:28:44,027
What were they doing?

400
00:28:44,193 --> 00:28:46,363
Once glass bottles
started getting thrown...

401
00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:50,469
...l started coming to terms with not being
cool enough to walk through the projects.

402
00:28:50,632 --> 00:28:52,435
They threw bottles at you?

403
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:56,208
l'm fine. l just have to, you know,
go the long way.

404
00:28:56,605 --> 00:28:58,542
That's all. It doesn't matter.

405
00:28:58,707 --> 00:29:01,244
No. You just have to live with it,
l guess.

406
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,347
You remember what they look like?

407
00:29:09,717 --> 00:29:11,988
l need your help.
l can't tell you what it is...

408
00:29:12,153 --> 00:29:15,692
...you can never ask me about it later,
and we're gonna hurt some people.

409
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:19,728
Whose car are we gonna take?

410
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:29,171
Townie credit card.

411
00:29:52,026 --> 00:29:54,497
ALEX: Who is it?
DOUG: Open up.

412
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,569
MAN:
What the--?

413
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:13,249
DOUG: Oh, shit, that hurts, huh?
Is that your throwing hand?

414
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,818
lf you're still here in a week,
we're coming back.

415
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,820
Let's go, we're done.

416
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:22,989
JEM:
Hey.

417
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:26,226
-What'd you do?
-l don't know what you're talking about.

418
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,360
JEM: That's my brother.
What'd you do to him?

419
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,363
ALEX:
l don't know what you're talking about.

420
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,765
JEM: You don't know? How about now?
ALEX: No.

421
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,201
Hey, chill, chill, chill, man. Chill.
Chill, man.

422
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:36,735
JEM:
Don't tell me to chill.

423
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:38,537
DOUG: Enough. Let's go.
JEM: What'd you do?

424
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,606
-l don't know what you're talking about.
JEM: No?

425
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:44,876
There goes college soccer.
Hey, look at me.

426
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:47,278
See my face?

427
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,648
Go tell the cops, all right?

428
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:52,853
But just remember, l seen yours too.

429
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,854
ALEX:
Fuck.

430
00:31:06,262 --> 00:31:09,201
l can't be up there
killing people, man.

431
00:31:09,766 --> 00:31:11,836
Hey, you brought me.

432
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:23,313
FRAWLEY:
Desmond Elden?

433
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:26,384
Yeah, works for Vericom.
Never seen the inside of a jail cell.

434
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:29,219
Most of these guys got no-show jobs.
Take down a truck...

435
00:31:29,385 --> 00:31:32,925
...foreman goes, ''Yeah, guy was here
yesterday.'' He shows us a forged timecard.

436
00:31:33,088 --> 00:31:35,993
Can't play them games at Vericom
because it's a public company.

437
00:31:36,158 --> 00:31:38,161
You don't show up,
it's a recorded sick day.

438
00:31:38,327 --> 00:31:40,964
And Dezzy here,
he's got some interesting sick days.

439
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:47,241
BankBoston, Cummins Armored,
Arlington Brinks, Cambridge Merchants.

440
00:31:53,741 --> 00:31:55,710
Jesus Christ.

441
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,817
CLAIRE: So do your parents
still live in Charlestown?

442
00:32:01,982 --> 00:32:06,358
DOUG: No, my father finally
made it out to the suburbs.

443
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,423
CLAIRE:
What about your mother?

444
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:11,794
l couldn't tell you.
She left when l was 6.

445
00:32:15,028 --> 00:32:16,530
What happened?

446
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,467
She left.

447
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:27,408
Okay.

448
00:32:38,716 --> 00:32:41,088
This sound woke me up.

449
00:32:43,189 --> 00:32:45,660
At first l didn't know what it was.

450
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:49,830
Sounded like an animal
that got trapped.

451
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:55,068
l never heard a man cry before.

452
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:59,840
l came downstairs in my underwear.

453
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:03,609
l see my father in the kitchen.

454
00:33:04,075 --> 00:33:06,345
First thing l remember was the ashtray.

455
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,981
Must have been a hundred cigarettes
in there.

456
00:33:09,146 --> 00:33:11,651
Ash like a little mountain.

457
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,054
He stopped crying...

458
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:18,826
...was just sitting there watching TV
on a little black-and-white.

459
00:33:18,989 --> 00:33:20,658
No sound.

460
00:33:22,993 --> 00:33:25,664
l think he just didn't know
what else to do.

461
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,271
He looked at me standing there
in the doorway in my Underoos.

462
00:33:34,837 --> 00:33:38,978
He said, ''Your mother left.
She's not coming back.''

463
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,447
Just like that.

464
00:33:45,147 --> 00:33:49,421
Smoking cigarettes and eating
a TV dinner at 6 in the morning.

465
00:33:52,787 --> 00:33:55,993
We lost our dog the year before...

466
00:33:58,527 --> 00:34:01,232
...and l wanted to make these posters...

467
00:34:02,397 --> 00:34:05,102
...in case my mother was lost...

468
00:34:05,267 --> 00:34:07,104
...someone could call us...

469
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:09,940
...like the guy who found our dog.

470
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:16,080
To this day my father will tell you he helped
me make them posters, but he didn't.

471
00:34:16,243 --> 00:34:20,117
Sat in the kitchen, drank a case of beer
while l went out on School Street...

472
00:34:20,281 --> 00:34:23,020
...asking people
if they'd seen my mother.

473
00:34:23,551 --> 00:34:25,321
Her name was Doris.

474
00:34:25,486 --> 00:34:30,662
My grandmother had a place
that's a restaurant in Tangerine, Florida.

475
00:34:30,823 --> 00:34:33,728
So l used to imagine
maybe that's where she went.

476
00:34:34,928 --> 00:34:40,673
Then l came to terms with the fact
that doesn't really matter, you know?

477
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:45,442
Wherever she went,
she had a good reason to leave here.

478
00:34:46,573 --> 00:34:49,413
She didn't wanna be
my mother anymore...

479
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:54,083
...and she wasn't coming back.

480
00:34:56,649 --> 00:35:00,022
And now you know a little bit
about my family...

481
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,925
...but l'm still not showing you
my apartment.

482
00:35:04,557 --> 00:35:06,862
How bad can it be?

483
00:35:17,235 --> 00:35:19,640
Oh, yeah.

484
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:36,121
DINO:
Desmond Elden.

485
00:35:36,288 --> 00:35:39,994
Systems tech at Vericom,
22 years old.

486
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:43,932
Albert Magloan. Only in Boston
is a guy named Albert Magloan.

487
00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:47,401
FRAWLEY: Mr. Magloan never met a car
he couldn't boost.

488
00:35:47,832 --> 00:35:49,434
The kind of talented individual...

489
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,341
...that can start your Cherokee for you
while you're still looking for your keys.

490
00:35:53,504 --> 00:35:57,645
DINO: James Coughlin. Father was killed
in prison, mother died of HIV.

491
00:35:57,807 --> 00:36:01,313
Shot 8rendan Leahey by the cemetery
behind Mishawum when he was 18.

492
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:05,485
Pled it out. When the judge asked him why
he did it, he said, ''l didn't like the kid.''

493
00:36:05,649 --> 00:36:07,719
Served nine years for manslaughter.

494
00:36:07,884 --> 00:36:11,590
FRAWLEY: These guys plan and execute
with sophistication and discipline.

495
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:14,292
And that is not our boy Coughlin.

496
00:36:14,457 --> 00:36:18,932
We think the architect is this guy,
Coughlin's best friend, Doug MacRay.

497
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,432
Lives in the same house,
dated Coughlin's sister...

498
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:26,173
...who most likely mules for the Florist,
who used to employ MacRay's father.

499
00:36:26,335 --> 00:36:28,706
You need a fucking Venn diagram
for these people.

500
00:36:29,638 --> 00:36:34,314
Mac Sr. got life for the Nashua job,
which most of you should remember.

501
00:36:34,476 --> 00:36:36,546
Hijacked a bread truck
up to New Hampshire...

502
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:39,015
...one of the guards saw his face...

503
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,852
...so they executed both of them
with their own weapons.

504
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:45,522
Big Mac's legacy is now no A car driver
is allowed to leave the cab...

505
00:36:45,688 --> 00:36:47,858
...even if there's a gun
to his partner's head.

506
00:36:48,022 --> 00:36:51,128
DINO: MacRay did eight months
for going over the counter at a BayBank...

507
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,295
...with a nail gun
after he washed out from pro hockey.

508
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,133
-Pro hockey?
DINO: Yeah, he was a big deal for a minute.

509
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,801
Got drafted, went to camp,
and here's the shocker:

510
00:36:58,965 --> 00:37:01,035
Started making trouble,
fighting with guys.

511
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:04,508
-Don't they pay you to fight in hockey?
-No, not the guys on your own team.

512
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:08,243
MacRay came home,
got into the family business.

513
00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:10,011
Same song, got into OxyContin.

514
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:13,315
Hockey ship sailed with the narcotics.

515
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,951
Now, we are a long way away
from a grand jury here.

516
00:37:16,116 --> 00:37:18,018
We'll never get 24-hour surveillance...

517
00:37:18,185 --> 00:37:20,756
...unless one of these idiots converts
to Islam.

518
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,757
So we build the case.

519
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:25,426
All right, let's get to work.

520
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:29,129
CLAIRE: So l've been telling all my friends
about you.

521
00:37:29,295 --> 00:37:31,332
-Oh, yeah? All good, l hope.
-Yeah.

522
00:37:32,398 --> 00:37:33,833
Eh.

523
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:38,173
Oh, yeah.
They say they're overcome with jealousy.

524
00:37:38,337 --> 00:37:40,741
They can't believe your luck.

525
00:37:40,905 --> 00:37:45,547
You moved to Charlestown,
hooked up with a rock-breaking townie.

526
00:37:47,145 --> 00:37:48,581
No.

527
00:37:49,814 --> 00:37:52,685
They just think it's a rebound.

528
00:37:52,984 --> 00:37:54,720
A rebound from what, the robbery?

529
00:37:54,886 --> 00:37:56,355
l don't know.

530
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:59,560
l feel estranged from them somehow.

531
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:04,498
What? Why do you look like that?

532
00:38:06,363 --> 00:38:10,104
-My brother died on a day like this.
-When was this?

533
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:13,841
He was little. He had lymphoma.

534
00:38:15,672 --> 00:38:19,613
So now on really sunny days
l always think of someone dying.

535
00:38:21,645 --> 00:38:23,982
That's wrong, isn't it?

536
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:26,584
No.

537
00:38:27,216 --> 00:38:29,721
l'm sure he'd be glad
you're thinking about him.

538
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:34,158
This is a good day.

539
00:38:34,323 --> 00:38:36,393
l'm having a good time.

540
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:38,062
Good.

541
00:38:38,661 --> 00:38:41,166
Then you'll miss me while l'm gone.

542
00:38:56,611 --> 00:38:58,514
JEM:
Money, bitch.

543
00:39:00,848 --> 00:39:02,151
Pop.

544
00:39:03,151 --> 00:39:06,323
What the fuck you doing here? Huh?

545
00:39:06,488 --> 00:39:08,090
DOUG: Nothing.
-Nothing? What's this?

546
00:39:08,255 --> 00:39:09,891
-Who're you here with, huh?
-No one.

547
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:12,695
-Let's get out of here.
JEM: You're telling me this is yours?

548
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,529
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Fucking Hawaiian pizza?

549
00:39:14,696 --> 00:39:16,298
-Sit down.
-Let's hit the road.

550
00:39:16,463 --> 00:39:18,867
-l gotta go.
-Sit the fuck down. Just sit down.

551
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,280
-Hi.
-Hi.

552
00:39:33,546 --> 00:39:35,483
-Hey.
-Claire.

553
00:39:35,648 --> 00:39:36,784
-l'm Jem.
-Jim?

554
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,452
Jem. Jem. It's just Jem, yeah.

555
00:39:38,618 --> 00:39:40,455
l'm friend of this loser right here.

556
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:44,093
-Nice to meet you.
-Sit down, sit down, relax. All right?

557
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:55,939
So l saw your fucking Avalanche
parked around the corner, so....

558
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,237
The Avalanche?

559
00:39:57,403 --> 00:40:00,142
-A truck.
-Fucking truck. His work truck right there.

560
00:40:01,674 --> 00:40:04,146
-Dougy's quite the worker.
-Yeah.

561
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,514
Have you two known each other
a long time or...?

562
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:10,353
JEM: Since we were 6.
We're like brothers. Right?

563
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:13,320
But he's never mentioned a word
about you.

564
00:40:13,485 --> 00:40:16,157
The secrets with this one, you know, huh?

565
00:40:20,192 --> 00:40:22,997
Did you say your name was Jim
or Jem?

566
00:40:23,161 --> 00:40:26,467
lt's Ji-- Je--
Well, it's both, actually.

567
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,236
Teachers, when we were growing up,
used to always say:

568
00:40:29,401 --> 00:40:31,872
''Hey, you can have this one.
He's a real gem.''

569
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,373
So l guess it kind of stuck.

570
00:40:35,807 --> 00:40:38,211
Whatever. l don't know.

571
00:40:38,376 --> 00:40:40,480
So, what do you do
for yourself there, Claire?

572
00:40:40,645 --> 00:40:42,515
Oh, l work at a bank.
l'm a bank manager.

573
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,285
You're a bank manager?
Sounds fun. What bank?

574
00:40:45,982 --> 00:40:48,587
Cambridge Merchants. Just over there.

575
00:40:48,753 --> 00:40:52,259
Cambridge Merchants. Wait, that's the one
that just got robbed, isn't it?

576
00:40:52,423 --> 00:40:54,159
lt got robbed, yeah. It did, yeah.

577
00:40:54,324 --> 00:40:57,764
JEM:
l read about that. It's crazy.

578
00:40:58,261 --> 00:40:59,931
So then how is it that you two met?

579
00:41:00,096 --> 00:41:01,198
CLAIRE:
Um....

580
00:41:01,998 --> 00:41:04,135
We met at a Laundromat.

581
00:41:05,268 --> 00:41:06,436
Okay.

582
00:41:06,603 --> 00:41:08,105
Love among the bleach, right?

583
00:41:08,271 --> 00:41:10,040
Hey, it happens more than you think.

584
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:19,151
Hey, Claire, don't get too used
to your life of leisure here.

585
00:41:19,315 --> 00:41:22,454
Dougy here, he's a real workaholic,
you know.

586
00:41:22,618 --> 00:41:25,090
He's always taking his work home
with him.

587
00:41:25,254 --> 00:41:26,723
Aren't you?

588
00:41:29,258 --> 00:41:31,060
-All right.
DOUG: All right, brother.

589
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,797
Take care of yourself, all right?
Be good.

590
00:41:33,963 --> 00:41:36,100
l'll see you at home.
It was nice to meet you.

591
00:41:36,264 --> 00:41:37,600
You too.

592
00:41:43,404 --> 00:41:47,245
Well, l guess you haven't been telling
all your friends about me.

593
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:56,719
Who you following, Jem?
Me or her?

594
00:41:56,884 --> 00:41:59,054
l told you, l made the Avalanche.

595
00:42:00,554 --> 00:42:02,792
Nothing to worry about.
It's all under control.

596
00:42:02,957 --> 00:42:04,827
Oh, so you're trying to get us
jammed up?

597
00:42:04,993 --> 00:42:07,263
-ls that it?
-l'm trying to get you jammed up.

598
00:42:08,128 --> 00:42:10,565
Tell me you got a move here, Dougy.

599
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:14,505
Because the only way l see it is you
got sprung like a goddamn bear trap...

600
00:42:14,668 --> 00:42:18,876
...on some toonie pussy who happens
to be the one goddamn person-- Fuck!

601
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:22,177
The one person that can give us
to the fucking feds.

602
00:42:25,378 --> 00:42:28,317
Calm down, all right?

603
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:30,851
Don't you think we need to be smart
right now?

604
00:42:31,017 --> 00:42:33,054
-Smart?
-Yeah.

605
00:42:34,487 --> 00:42:36,757
Let's start fucking all the witnesses.
All right?

606
00:42:36,922 --> 00:42:41,130
Yeah, l'm blowing the assistant manager.
Am l smart now? Huh?

607
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:45,566
And no, l didn't tell the other guys,
only because they'd flip the fuck out.

608
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:48,201
And l want them fucking ready
for the next thing.

609
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:50,503
l told you, the next fucking thing's
not ready.

610
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:51,836
Then make it ready.

611
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:55,744
l don't like the guards
on the next thing, all right?

612
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,211
One kid is like fucking G.l. Joe.

613
00:42:58,376 --> 00:43:02,650
He wears the vest on the outside, tucks
his pants into his fucking combat boots.

614
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:04,516
The truck's fucking waist-high.

615
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:07,520
We'll find another truck
with a driver...

616
00:43:07,684 --> 00:43:10,489
...who's a fucking fat kid
with his fucking shit untucked...

617
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:13,760
-...who don't think he's Special Forces.
-Yeah?

618
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,829
All right, look, l know you're
happy in Fuck City over there...

619
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:19,766
...but l waited nine years in Walpole
for you, motherfucker.

620
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,134
Just nine years, that's all.

621
00:43:23,566 --> 00:43:25,436
l'm done waiting.

622
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:30,175
This is the last one.
We're hitting pause after this.

623
00:43:31,107 --> 00:43:34,580
We get pinched,
remember whose idea this was, okay?

624
00:43:35,845 --> 00:43:37,715
Be ready on Friday.

625
00:43:52,694 --> 00:43:55,199
MAN [OVER SPEAKER]:
Visitors, straight ahead.

626
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:28,131
-Who you seeing?
-Stephen MacRay.

627
00:44:44,878 --> 00:44:46,380
LENNY:
Twelve.

628
00:44:46,546 --> 00:44:49,217
-Right down there.
-Thanks, Lenny.

629
00:45:09,836 --> 00:45:13,676
You all right? Every time l come up
here now it's the red pajamas.

630
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,876
You still getting in trouble, Dad?

631
00:45:16,042 --> 00:45:20,115
Hey, you know how it is.
l can't take no shit.

632
00:45:20,279 --> 00:45:22,983
You're getting a little old
for that bullshit, aren't you?

633
00:45:23,148 --> 00:45:25,753
Fucking Southie kids.
They wanna run everything.

634
00:45:25,918 --> 00:45:29,424
Listen, you put a year together of
good behavior and get your points down...

635
00:45:29,587 --> 00:45:31,825
...you get classed out
over to Norfolk, Dad.

636
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:34,995
No one's gonna bother you there.
Nobody fights, you know?

637
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,931
They got fucking Ben & Jerry's
ice cream and shit.

638
00:45:38,096 --> 00:45:42,337
Well, some things you gotta deal with
yourself, you know?

639
00:45:47,004 --> 00:45:48,373
All right.

640
00:45:54,845 --> 00:45:59,386
l'm thinking about taking a trip.

641
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:02,722
-Going dark for a minute.
-Taking heat?

642
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,924
Nah, just making a change.

643
00:46:06,089 --> 00:46:07,792
Yeah, don't tell me.

644
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:09,327
''Making a change.''

645
00:46:09,491 --> 00:46:12,096
Either you got heat or you don't.

646
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:16,200
l heard a bread truck got dropped.

647
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:18,836
Oh, yeah? l didn't hear about it.

648
00:46:19,236 --> 00:46:20,972
Okay.

649
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:25,010
MAN:
You got five minutes. Five minutes.

650
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,678
DOUG:
Let me ask you something.

651
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:29,846
ln case l don't see you again.

652
00:46:33,381 --> 00:46:35,551
How come you never...?

653
00:46:36,718 --> 00:46:38,688
How come you never looked for her?

654
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:42,393
Uh....

655
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,460
Looked for who?

656
00:46:46,761 --> 00:46:48,330
For Ma.

657
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:51,935
For my mother.
How come you never looked for her?

658
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,372
How come you never tried to call nobody
or look for her, or ask around?

659
00:46:55,535 --> 00:46:57,739
Look, when your mother left...

660
00:46:58,572 --> 00:47:03,214
...you cried so hard you were throwing up.
All over the parlor.

661
00:47:04,411 --> 00:47:07,617
So l told you if you looked around
you might find her.

662
00:47:07,781 --> 00:47:09,918
Just to give you an activity.

663
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:13,322
l didn't think you'd carry it
like a fucking disease.

664
00:47:15,289 --> 00:47:18,028
What, you wanna think
she was an angel?

665
00:47:18,391 --> 00:47:20,094
Go ahead.

666
00:47:20,793 --> 00:47:23,131
But look out your front door.

667
00:47:23,297 --> 00:47:26,001
How many 22-year-old girls
are out there...

668
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:30,607
...they're fucking around
with kids they don't want...

669
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:35,044
...and, you know,
no sense in their heads.

670
00:47:36,008 --> 00:47:39,047
And your mother wasn't no different.

671
00:47:39,211 --> 00:47:41,315
That's the hard truth.

672
00:47:42,315 --> 00:47:45,788
l made my peace with it.
You make yours.

673
00:47:46,285 --> 00:47:50,926
l didn't look for her
because there was nothing to find.

674
00:47:59,998 --> 00:48:03,938
Look, l gotta die five times
before l get out of here...

675
00:48:04,102 --> 00:48:07,641
...but l'll see you again.

676
00:48:08,439 --> 00:48:10,676
This side or the other.

677
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,210
CLAIRE:
So l saw your picture yesterday.

678
00:48:48,643 --> 00:48:51,982
-Are you sure it was me?
-Yeah, l'm pretty sure.

679
00:48:52,781 --> 00:48:56,053
-Oh, the Boys & Girls Club?
-Yeah.

680
00:48:56,218 --> 00:48:58,288
lt was under a ''local heroes'' banner.

681
00:48:58,452 --> 00:49:01,859
Yeah. They got a real low standard
for who qualifies on that.

682
00:49:02,324 --> 00:49:03,860
Apparently you were drafted.

683
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:09,702
Yeah. l was slow.
And l couldn't skate backwards.

684
00:49:09,964 --> 00:49:13,003
You're supposed to be able to skate
backwards in pro hockey.

685
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:17,676
But l could shoot, you know?
l could hit anything with a hockey puck.

686
00:49:18,806 --> 00:49:23,414
But l got drafted and l just didn't do
what it took to make the team.

687
00:49:23,576 --> 00:49:28,218
And when l got a second chance,
l blew that too.

688
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:32,988
They sent me home and that was it.

689
00:49:33,153 --> 00:49:35,591
l look at that picture
and l see a 20-year-old kid...

690
00:49:35,755 --> 00:49:38,494
...who thinks he's, you know,
got it all figured out.

691
00:49:39,793 --> 00:49:43,432
Right before he's about
to throw it all away.

692
00:49:54,473 --> 00:49:57,377
Hey, l don't wanna rush anything,
but can we go into your room?

693
00:49:57,543 --> 00:50:00,347
Because my uncle the bus driver
lives right across the way...

694
00:50:00,511 --> 00:50:03,317
...and he can see
right into this apartment.

695
00:50:04,784 --> 00:50:07,155

You print the inside of the van?

DINO: frawl, the inside of the van
is a volcano.

751
00:58:49,819 --> 00:58:53,492
Just find something and make it look
like something that looks like a print.

752
00:58:54,523 --> 00:58:56,660
We don't have enough

_ight now, they are burning the money
bands at some bullshit safe house.

All their alibis were paid for

We're not gonna pull any DNA
off of this or off the switch car.

And that, as they say, is that.

This is the ''not fucking around'' crew.
Find me something that looks like a print...

...so l can grab one of these assholes
and shake their tree.

Turn around for me, will you?

762
00:59:58,384 --> 01:00:00,588
Go ahead,

763
01:00:03,555 --> 01:00:07,295
''Come here, get on the ground,
before l pop your fucking teeth out!''

764
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:12,233
Come on, read it. Read it all.
There's about five things there.

765
01:00:12,966 --> 01:00:14,835
Uh....

766
01:00:15,601 --> 01:00:17,438
What is it with you guys
in Charlestown?

767
01:00:17,603 --> 01:00:20,642
Don't they teach you how to read?
There's things here. Read them.

768
01:00:20,806 --> 01:00:23,076
l don't wanna read that.
This doesn't sound right.

769
01:00:23,241 --> 01:00:26,413
l'm not asking you, l'm telling you.
Read the pages, please.

770
01:00:26,578 --> 01:00:28,748
l'm trying to make this
sound authenticious.

775
01:00:42,092 --> 01:00:44,029
Local crime fighter.

776
01:00:44,295 --> 01:00:45,930
What's happening, Dino?

777
01:00:46,998 --> 01:00:48,568
l know your father.

778
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:53,038
Yeah. Me too.

779
01:00:53,203 --> 01:00:55,307

780
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,977
Yeah, one or two.

781
01:00:59,176 --> 01:01:01,513
l hear they got to the old guy.

782
01:01:02,145 --> 01:01:03,814
Split him up the back.

783
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:05,248
Fucking animals.

784
01:01:05,649 --> 01:01:08,153
You'd think they'd go after
a younger kid.

785
01:01:08,452 --> 01:01:11,456
l don't know.
Making a statement, l guess.

786
01:01:11,822 --> 01:01:14,193
Townie crews ain't
what they used to be.

787
01:01:15,624 --> 01:01:17,127
Dorchester...

788
01:01:17,293 --> 01:01:18,561
...Southie...

789
01:01:19,161 --> 01:01:21,131
...looking to make a move.

790
01:01:22,231 --> 01:01:24,401
Maybe you can change all that
when you get up there.

791
01:01:26,565 --> 01:01:29,336
Let me ask you a question.
What do you call a guy...

792
01:01:29,502 --> 01:01:32,741
...who grows up with a group of people,
gets to know their secrets...

793
01:01:32,905 --> 01:01:34,975
...because they trust him,
and then turns around...

794
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:38,913
...and use those secrets against them,
put those people in prison?

795
01:01:39,544 --> 01:01:42,516
You'd call him a rat, right?
You know what l call him?

796
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,350
Dino the dago.

797
01:01:44,516 --> 01:01:47,355
Those people made you
a part of that community.

798
01:01:47,552 --> 01:01:49,354
What did they get for it?

799
01:01:49,821 --> 01:01:52,091
lnside of the fucking can.

800
01:01:53,594 --> 01:01:57,167
You know we lifted a print
off the van? Right?

801
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,608
Special Agent Frawley...

802
01:02:07,907 --> 01:02:08,942
...Douglas MacRay.

803
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,480
FRAWLEY:
You and your boys didn't just...

804
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:18,387
...roll a Star Market
over in Malden for a box of quarters.

805
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:20,753
No, you decided to bang it out...

806
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:24,259
...in the North End at 9:OO in the morning.
With assault rifles.

807
01:02:25,223 --> 01:02:28,562
You fucking dummies shot a guard.

808
01:02:29,861 --> 01:02:33,668
Now you're like a half-off sale
at Big and Tall. Every cop is in line.

809
01:02:33,832 --> 01:02:35,669
Fortunately, though, for you...

810
01:02:35,834 --> 01:02:38,605
...this guard,
who is two-thirds to a retard...

811
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:40,372
...has miraculously clung to life.

812
01:02:40,538 --> 01:02:42,174
Now, if it were up to me...

813
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:45,079
...and they gave me two minutes
and a wet towel...

814
01:02:45,443 --> 01:02:47,747
...l would personally asphyxiate
this half-wit...

815
01:02:47,912 --> 01:02:50,116
...so we could string you up
on a federal M1...

816
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,485
...and end this story
with a bag on your head...

817
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:55,488
...and a paralyzing agent
running through your veins.

818
01:02:56,687 --> 01:03:00,026
This isn't fucking townie hopscotch
anymore, Doug.

819
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:03,895
But l did want to say one thing.

820
01:03:05,395 --> 01:03:07,732
You're here today
so l could personally tell you...

821
01:03:07,897 --> 01:03:10,869
...that you are going to die
in federal prison.

822
01:03:11,735 --> 01:03:13,905
And so are all your friends.

823
01:03:14,269 --> 01:03:15,839
No deal.

824
01:03:16,238 --> 01:03:17,440
No compromise.

825
01:03:18,742 --> 01:03:20,711
And when that day comes...

826
01:03:20,877 --> 01:03:23,781
...when you start trying to be
my hero collaborator so hard...

827
01:03:23,947 --> 01:03:26,918
...that l have to slap you to shut up--
And it will come...

828
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:32,960
...despite your pitiable,
misguided, Irish omerta.

829
01:03:33,122 --> 01:03:36,629
--when your code of silence
finally gives way...

830
01:03:36,792 --> 01:03:41,868
...to fear of trafficking in cigarettes
to prevent sexual enslavement...

831
01:03:43,197 --> 01:03:48,039
...l just want you to know that it's gonna
be me who tells you to go fuck yourself.

832
01:03:52,807 --> 01:03:57,182
Hey, next time you guys
wanna take pictures of me, just call ahead.

833
01:03:57,344 --> 01:03:59,481
You know, we can do better
than a barbeque.

834
01:03:59,647 --> 01:04:01,884
A calendar shoot. You know?

835
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:03,752
Maybe topless, lubed up.

836
01:04:03,918 --> 01:04:05,820
Whatever you guys are into.

837
01:04:06,753 --> 01:04:09,291
FBl car antennas
are half-inch matte black...

838
01:04:09,456 --> 01:04:12,194
...about three-quarters the way down
the rear windshield.

839
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:13,594
Statie are pigtailed...

840
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,530
...B.P.D., half and half.

841
01:04:15,929 --> 01:04:19,970
Every peewee in the town knows
what an FBl rear antenna looks like.

842
01:04:20,133 --> 01:04:23,773
So, in the future, if you guys
are gonna try to be slick...

843
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:26,540
...be slicker than a 6-year-old.

844
01:04:27,273 --> 01:04:29,010
l gotta get back to work.

845
01:04:29,341 --> 01:04:30,943
Can l go?

846
01:04:34,547 --> 01:04:36,384
Good luck with that print.

847
01:05:06,911 --> 01:05:08,480
WOMAN [OVER PHONE]:
Good morning, Cambridge Savings.

848
01:05:08,645 --> 01:05:11,350
Claire Keesey, please.
She's the manager.

849
01:05:11,515 --> 01:05:14,354
Oh, she's no longer working here.

850
01:05:14,518 --> 01:05:16,021
-Since when?
-friday.

851
01:05:16,187 --> 01:05:20,094
Just get the warrant. Land, cell, e-mail,
fax, Skype. The whole fucking thing.

852
01:05:25,063 --> 01:05:27,233
DOUG: Why didn't you tell me
you quit your job?

853
01:05:27,397 --> 01:05:28,432
CLAIRE:
l don't know.

854
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:30,602
Why don't you tell me
what's in the box?

855
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:32,271
-What, this?
-Mm-hm.

856
01:05:32,669 --> 01:05:38,614
Anybody call you or say anything to you
or anything like that? After?

857
01:05:38,776 --> 01:05:39,844
CLAIRE:
Mm. Nope.

858
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:42,047
No? Well, what are you gonna do?

859
01:05:42,212 --> 01:05:43,547
You know what? l don't know.

860
01:05:43,714 --> 01:05:48,289
l can teach, volunteer full-time.

861
01:05:48,451 --> 01:05:49,887
l have a little saved.

862
01:05:50,053 --> 01:05:51,488
So....

863
01:05:53,023 --> 01:05:55,427
What if l told you
l was gonna quit my job too?

864
01:05:56,492 --> 01:05:58,228
Well, then l guess l'd have company.

865
01:05:59,128 --> 01:06:01,766
We'd do it together. Here.

866
01:06:02,198 --> 01:06:04,468
lt's just a necklace, that's all.

867
01:06:06,568 --> 01:06:08,705
Why don't we go away together.

868
01:06:08,871 --> 01:06:11,442
Take a trip for a minute, you know?
Something like that.

869
01:06:11,606 --> 01:06:13,776
You know, just fun.

870
01:06:14,342 --> 01:06:15,377
Doug.

871
01:06:15,544 --> 01:06:17,814
ls it right?
Took me forever trying to pick it.

872
01:06:17,979 --> 01:06:21,251
-Arguing with the lady, and--
-lt's beautiful, but it--

873
01:06:21,416 --> 01:06:23,953
Well, as long as you didn't,
you know, sell your truck.

874
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:26,356
Someone took over the payments.

875
01:06:28,256 --> 01:06:30,426
You know, people get up every day...

876
01:06:30,591 --> 01:06:32,996
...tell themselves
they're gonna change their lives.

877
01:06:33,161 --> 01:06:34,897
They never do.

878
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:37,933
l'm gonna change mine.

879
01:06:38,465 --> 01:06:40,402
Why don't you do it with me.

880
01:06:42,203 --> 01:06:45,275
Okay, well, where would we go?

881
01:06:45,438 --> 01:06:48,210
Come with me, l don't care.
We could go wherever you want.

882
01:06:48,608 --> 01:06:52,015
l mean, you know, there's things....

883
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:55,451
There's a few things
you still don't know about me.

884
01:06:57,251 --> 01:06:58,753
What do you mean?

885
01:06:59,619 --> 01:07:03,693
Nothing. l just understand if you have
some reservations, you know?

886
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:08,565
Between the kind of things people say
about me and the things l'm not proud of...

887
01:07:08,728 --> 01:07:10,230
...don't leave a lot of room.

888
01:07:10,395 --> 01:07:11,697
l know who you are.

889
01:07:11,865 --> 01:07:12,900
You do?

890
01:07:13,066 --> 01:07:16,138
Yeah, l do. Yeah.

891
01:07:16,501 --> 01:07:18,705
Does that mean you want to go with me?

892
01:07:19,972 --> 01:07:21,275
Yeah.

893
01:07:22,474 --> 01:07:24,243
Let's start now.

894
01:07:25,409 --> 01:07:26,879
Okay.

DINO:
fraw_.

What is it?

897
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:38,025
Phone conversation between Claire Keesey
and a burner cell about an hour ago.

898
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:40,761
See if you can recognize the voice.

899
01:07:41,859 --> 01:07:44,163
00UG: _ey, can l come over?
l want to talk to you.

900
01:07:44,328 --> 01:07:46,198
CLAIRE:
Yeah. Where have you been?

901
01:07:46,597 --> 01:07:47,999
DOUG:
Sory, l got held up.

902
01:07:48,165 --> 01:07:50,002
l'm coming over from my place.

01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:52,137
Will you come down the back
and let me in?

01:07:54,972 --> 01:07:57,209
fRAWLfY: _adn't realized you'd left
your job at the bank.

Uh.... Oh, yeah. Yeah. Last week.

906
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:06,150
l'm sorry,
was l supposed to notify someone?

907
01:08:10,887 --> 01:08:12,522
Fancy.

908
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:14,325
Yeah. It was a gift.

909
01:08:20,829 --> 01:08:22,899
We have our suspects.

910
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:26,905
l came by to share this with you.

911
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:32,242
James Coughlin.

912
01:08:32,473 --> 01:08:34,443
Albert Magloan.

913
01:08:35,777 --> 01:08:37,313
Desmond Elden.

914
01:08:37,478 --> 01:08:40,417
Part of a crew that we tied
into the bank job at North End...

915
01:08:40,581 --> 01:08:44,655
...and at least three other
armored car robberies.

916
01:08:49,123 --> 01:08:50,659
Look familiar?

917
01:08:53,328 --> 01:08:55,866
You opened the safe for him.

918
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:59,035
He left you unharmed...

919
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:04,276
...and now the two of you are carrying on a
relationship about which you lied to the FBl.

920
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:05,507
l was wrong.

921
01:09:06,506 --> 01:09:08,576
You do need a lawyer.

922
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:17,986
DOUG:
Something wrong with the apartment?

01:09:18,151 --> 01:09:20,388
JEM:
No. Florist.

924
01:09:21,288 --> 01:09:22,456
Florist? What?

925
01:09:22,621 --> 01:09:24,124
Came through.

926

-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-lt's large, Dougy.

-lt's large.
-We're smoked. Punt it.

928
01:09:30,596 --> 01:09:34,770
Look, pick up an extra guy. All right?
Or go with three guys.

929
01:09:34,934 --> 01:09:37,171
Or fucking be smart and boot it.

01:09:37,336 --> 01:09:39,306
Oh, so you're not going?

01:09:40,473 --> 01:09:41,741
No.

932
01:09:43,541 --> 01:09:44,943
And why's that?

933
01:09:45,111 --> 01:09:47,448
Because we got a ton of heat on us,
for one thing.

934
01:09:47,612 --> 01:09:50,049
We'll put a move on.
We've done it a hundred times.

935
01:09:50,215 --> 01:09:53,254
You know what? Forget it.
Do what you want to do. l'm done.

-l'm done.

-l don't know. What's that mean?
-What you think it means?

939
01:10:00,557 --> 01:10:02,995
What does that mean?
Sounds like a bunch of bullshit.

940
01:10:03,161 --> 01:10:07,034
Let me put it to you this way: l'm putting
this whole fucking town in my rear-view.

941
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:11,872
There's people l can't let you

943
01:10:13,971 --> 01:10:15,373
Who?

944
01:10:16,974 --> 01:10:18,409
Come on.

945
01:10:21,212 --> 01:10:23,316
Are you serious, Jimmy?

946
01:10:24,015 --> 01:10:25,517
She's not my kid.

947
01:10:27,352 --> 01:10:29,489
Did she tell you it was?

948
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:32,759
l mean, come the f-- Cut it out.

949
01:10:32,923 --> 01:10:34,993
All you give a fuck about

01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:38,031
...now you're trying to play it off
like you care about Shyne?

You think you're better than people.

Mr. Fucking-Clean.
Mr. Fucking-Goddamn-High-and-Mighty.

l'm better than all these people.
l'm better than everybody.

954
01:10:47,003 --> 01:10:49,274
But you grew up right here.

955
01:10:49,839 --> 01:10:51,141
Same rules that l did.

956
01:10:51,308 --> 01:10:53,144
Who the fuck you think you are?

957
01:10:53,309 --> 01:10:56,014
You aren't letting me
or not letting me do shit, all right?

958
01:10:56,179 --> 01:10:57,849
Here's a little cheat sheet for you.

959
01:10:58,014 --> 01:11:01,086
lt's never gonna be me and you
and your sister and Shyne...

960

...fucking playing house up there.

961
01:11:03,019 --> 01:11:06,325
All right? You got it?
Get that in your fucking head!

962
01:11:06,489 --> 01:11:09,494
l'm tired of your one-way
fucking bullshit.

...feds have me dropping Brendan

967
01:11:55,935 --> 01:11:58,239
l got him back on Tibbetts.

968
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,412
Fucking guy ran 100 yards
with a bullet in his heart, Dougy.

969
01:12:03,576 --> 01:12:07,717
l mean, the fucking guy should've ran track.
You know what l'm saying?

970
01:12:11,817 --> 01:12:13,187
l didn't ask you to do that.

971
01:12:13,353 --> 01:12:15,490
Yeah, well, you didn't have to, Dougy.
Come on.

972
01:12:16,121 --> 01:12:20,062
They told me Brendan was coming down
here to roll up on you with a Glock 21.

973
01:12:20,225 --> 01:12:23,197
So l came over here,
and l put him in the fucking ground.

974
01:12:25,063 --> 01:12:26,765
Did nine years for it.

975
01:12:28,733 --> 01:12:30,503
Now, you don't gotta thank me...

976
01:12:31,203 --> 01:12:32,972
...but you're not walking away.

977
01:12:35,139 --> 01:12:38,011
l'm grateful for everything you done
for me.

978
01:12:39,277 --> 01:12:42,249
Your family took me in
when my father went away.

979
01:12:45,082 --> 01:12:46,919
You're like a brother to me.

980
01:12:48,653 --> 01:12:50,356
But l'm leaving.

981
01:12:53,157 --> 01:12:54,792
Gonna shoot me?

982
01:12:56,026 --> 01:12:57,529
Go ahead.

983
01:12:58,795 --> 01:13:01,232
But you're gonna have to shoot me
in the back.

984
01:13:13,443 --> 01:13:15,380

-All right.

How you doing, Fergie?

986
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:21,286
Listen, just wanted to stop by
and tell you myself...

987
01:13:22,051 --> 01:13:24,790
...whatever this thing is you got
going on...

988
01:13:24,954 --> 01:13:28,026
...l think my guys can handle it
without me. You know what l mean?

989
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:30,193
l wouldn't hire them without you.

990
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:32,296
And l wouldn't hire you without them.

991
01:13:32,461 --> 01:13:33,696
You're a unit.

992
01:13:33,861 --> 01:13:37,668
Look, with all due respect,
l didn't come here for a debate.

993
01:13:38,199 --> 01:13:39,869
l'm not doing it.

994
01:13:40,134 --> 01:13:44,008
So, you know, work it out
however you can. l....

995
01:13:44,172 --> 01:13:46,977
Calm down. Okay?

996
01:13:47,141 --> 01:13:50,046
lt goes against
my better judgment...

997
01:13:50,777 --> 01:13:53,883
...but just out of respect,

...just take this for it, all right?

999
01:13:57,285 --> 01:13:58,353
Not gonna cut it.

1000
01:13:59,086 --> 01:14:02,091
Do you think l'm gonna put
Joe Flipperhead on this?

1001
01:14:02,590 --> 01:14:04,527
You're gonna do what l ask.

DOUG:
Not gonna cut it, huh?

1003
01:14:08,495 --> 01:14:09,730
Okay.

1004
01:14:09,896 --> 01:14:13,002
Let me ask you something.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

1005
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,504
The only guy in Charlestown
with a gun?

1006
01:14:15,901 --> 01:14:17,838
You guys run numbers and pump dope.

1007
01:14:18,004 --> 01:14:21,076
You're an old guy who don't know
his glory years are behind him.

1008
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:24,279
l ain't fucking working for you.
Got it?

1009
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:29,351
You got a problem with that, l live at
551 Bunker Hill Street. Stop by anytime.

1010
01:14:29,515 --> 01:14:31,218
You know where to find me.

1011
01:14:31,851 --> 01:14:33,887
You're gonna do this for me...

1012
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:36,457
...or l'm gonna clip your nuts...

1013
01:14:36,756 --> 01:14:38,226
...like l clipped your daddy's.

1014
01:14:38,857 --> 01:14:40,393
Don't talk about my father.

1015
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:43,096
Son, l knew your daddy.

1016
01:14:43,261 --> 01:14:46,200
He worked for me for years. Years.

1017
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,836
Then he wanted his own thing.

1018
01:14:51,569 --> 01:14:52,637
You play the horses?

1019
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:59,182
You know, they either geld a horse
with a knife...

1020
01:14:59,344 --> 01:15:01,281
...or with the chemicals.

1021
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,884
When your daddy said no to me...

1022
01:15:04,349 --> 01:15:06,285
...l did him the chemical way.

1023
01:15:06,884 --> 01:15:08,621
Gave your mother a taste.

1024
01:15:08,787 --> 01:15:10,422
Put the hook into her.

1025
01:15:10,822 --> 01:15:13,159
She doped up good and proper.

1026
01:15:13,924 --> 01:15:16,728
Hung herself with a wire
on Melnea Cass.

1027
01:15:17,361 --> 01:15:20,266
And you? Running around
the neighborhood, looking for her.

1028
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:23,468
Your daddy didn't have the heart
to tell his son...

1029
01:15:23,635 --> 01:15:26,841
...that he was looking for a suicide doper
who was never coming home.

1030

lf there's a heaven, son,
she ain't in it.

Oh.

sweet new girlfriend.

1033
01:15:42,753 --> 01:15:44,289
Lives on the park.

1034
01:15:45,088 --> 01:15:48,160
l don't want to send her
funeral arrangement to your house...

1035
01:15:49,058 --> 01:15:50,895
...but l will if l have to.

1036

All right, you need to give me a chance
to explain myself first. Okay?

1044
01:16:22,391 --> 01:16:23,459
No. You had a chance.

1045

Who talked to you?

1046
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:30,066
The FBl, Doug.

1047
01:16:32,299 --> 01:16:34,202
You have to listen to me.

01:16:34,368 --> 01:16:36,906
You have to let me explain this.
You understand?

1049

Easy, now.

Why did you do this to me?

01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:52,454
Claire, l'm sorry. Okay?

1055
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:55,491
l was gonna tell you.
l came over here that night to tell you.

What, the night you fucked me?
Is that your thing?

1057

lt's not enough to terrorize someone,
you have to fuck them too?

-Listen to me. Calm down, okay?
-No. No. Get out. Get out!

Don't fucking touch me.

How many banks have you robbed?

Six trucks, two banks.

Have you ever killed anyone?

No.

Still taking the punches.
Still ahead on points.

Now, l have a fellow

He likes to play the ponies.
Has a gambling sickness.

1097
01:20:29,259 --> 01:20:31,896
He couldn't pick a horse
to save his fucking life.

1098
01:20:32,463 --> 01:20:34,733
But courtesy of this sick man...

FRAWLEY:
Well, the gang's all here.

There's always a weak spot.

We just need to find it.

1103
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:56,823

15 minutes before the van does the pickup.

That is when you hit.

1105
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:03,361
And Monday morning,
after a four-game stand with New York...

1106
01:21:03,526 --> 01:21:08,434
...60,OOO beers, food, merchandise,
total haul:

Three and a half million.

1108
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:18,478
Taking down the cathedral of Boston.

1109
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:19,842
Priceless.

1110
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:37,861
How long you think it's gonna take Rusty

1111
01:21:38,025 --> 01:21:39,228
...when this thing's over?

JEM: Well, he should have picked
better horses.

This is gonna be a motherfucker.
You know that, right?

01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:53,211
Well, if they were easy, kid,

MAN 1 [ON TM: Lined into right field.
A base hit. Youkilis is headed for third base.

Hey, Bobby. Yeah, three Buds.

You're all right.

01:22:41,819 --> 01:22:44,256
lt doesn't mean
you're getting fucked, though.

1128

You gotta chase the rabbit
if you want the tail.

1129
01:22:49,894 --> 01:22:51,196
My mom taught me that.

1130
01:22:55,867 --> 01:22:58,571
You used to hang around
with Doug MacRay a little bit, huh?

1131
01:22:59,736 --> 01:23:01,105
How do you know Dougy?

1132
01:23:01,272 --> 01:23:03,008
We sort of work together.

1133
01:23:03,406 --> 01:23:04,708
Sand and Gravel?

1134
01:23:05,342 --> 01:23:07,078
No. No, no.

1135
01:23:14,416 --> 01:23:16,787
You a pretty decent judge of size?

1136
01:23:17,353 --> 01:23:18,621
Depends.

1137
01:23:19,321 --> 01:23:20,790
Size of what?

1138
01:23:22,125 --> 01:23:23,660
FRAWLEY:
How big would you say that is?

1139
01:23:24,527 --> 01:23:25,729
Six inches?

1140
01:23:26,328 --> 01:23:27,797
Over or under?

1141
01:23:28,164 --> 01:23:29,199
Under.

1142
01:23:29,364 --> 01:23:30,533
Wrong.

1143
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:33,337
6.14 inches exactly.

1144
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:37,107
l know everything there is to know
about money.

1145
01:23:37,338 --> 01:23:40,177
Thickness: .O043 inches.

1146

Weight: about one gram.

1147
01:23:45,613 --> 01:23:47,550
Which is interesting...

1148
01:23:47,715 --> 01:23:51,522
...because that means that this $20 bill
isn't even worth its own weight...

1149
01:23:51,686 --> 01:23:53,623
...in Oxy.

1150
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:00,828
So how does it work?

1151
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:03,832
Bartender gets a call...

1152
01:24:04,932 --> 01:24:07,937
...you pick up a package at point A,
deliver it to point B...

1153
01:24:08,101 --> 01:24:10,639
...the Florist gives you C?

1154
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,277
You're thinking of running out on me.

1155
01:24:17,978 --> 01:24:21,050
lt's not that simple.
Because, you see...

1156
01:24:22,115 --> 01:24:23,951
...l start waving this around
in here...

1157
01:24:28,688 --> 01:24:30,057
...bad for you.

1158
01:24:34,426 --> 01:24:36,029
l want a lawyer.

1159
01:24:36,362 --> 01:24:38,299
Good. Get one.

1160
01:24:39,232 --> 01:24:41,803
l mean, it's all about protecting
yourself, right?

1161
01:24:42,101 --> 01:24:45,373
Not even yourself. Your daughter.

1162
01:24:45,537 --> 01:24:48,074
Don't talk about my daughter.

1163
01:24:50,343 --> 01:24:52,714
How long were you with MacRay?

1164
01:24:53,812 --> 01:24:55,114
All my life.

1165
01:24:56,413 --> 01:24:58,985
ln all those years
that you were together...

1166
01:25:00,886 --> 01:25:04,125
...how many diamond necklaces
did he give you?

1167
01:25:06,957 --> 01:25:08,727
JEM:

...l can stop looking.

1473
01:58:07,718 --> 01:58:09,420
No matter how much you change...

1474
01:58:09,585 --> 01:58:12,490
...you still have to pay the price
for the things you've done.

1475
01:58:15,691 --> 01:58:17,528
So l got a long road.
