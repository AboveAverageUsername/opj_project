3
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:02,492
It's great... really quite great.

4
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:05,831
Still... if it goes further
- and I'd really love to-

5
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:09,192
We run the risk of getting into
a strong relationship.

6
00:02:09,806 --> 00:02:11,579
Who knows how far it would take us?

7
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,579
Are we ready for such a shock?

8
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:19,307
- We don't have to be serious about it.
- But it is. Very serious.

9
00:02:20,238 --> 00:02:22,103
The first kiss is something huge.

10
00:02:22,587 --> 00:02:25,860
To me, what we've just lived
is already a story

11
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:28,542
Don't pretend you're afraid of me!

12
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:32,202
It has nothing to do with fear.
Quite the contrary.

13
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:35,086
Making that moment last
gives me incredible pleasure.

14
00:02:35,632 --> 00:02:37,201
It gives it its chance.

15
00:02:38,156 --> 00:02:39,155
Sorry...

16
00:02:39,588 --> 00:02:41,474
Why should we get further with it?

17
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,292
It's marvellous...

18
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:46,428
We've known each other for 2 hours
and time has already stopped.

19
00:02:47,223 --> 00:02:50,315
And what will happen next?

20
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:54,542
Let's say I ask you to my room
for a drink.

21
00:02:55,656 --> 00:02:56,702
Let's say so.

22
00:02:57,226 --> 00:02:59,680
Our coming together would
look quite ordinary.

23
00:03:00,423 --> 00:03:02,467
A good surprise is always possible...

24
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:06,992
but things would probably turn
into something quite conformist.

25
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:11,901
Look! Some guy is following us.

26
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:15,696
He's been standing there
since we left the bar.

27
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,697
- He is a tourist!
- Doesn't look like it.

28
00:03:19,902 --> 00:03:21,129
What does he want?

29
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:24,473
- Go ask him!
- You think so?

30
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:31,064
- Yes?
- There's something...

31
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,177
Chritophe Abadi. I'm your bodyguard.

32
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:35,679
- My bodyguard?
- Yes.

33
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:38,520
- Mr. Lassalle didn't tell you?
- No.

34
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:43,020
- Sorry, I should have told you.
- I didn't ask to be protected.

35
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,499
Are you in danger?
What have you done?

36
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,159
- No, it's nonsensical.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb.

37
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:51,387
There must be some misunderstanding.
I'll phone Mr Lassalle.

38
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:53,500
Lassalle? The Lassalle case?

39
00:03:53,863 --> 00:03:57,931
You're defending her? I heard that
he fired all her lawyers.

40
00:03:58,251 --> 00:04:00,887
Give me a few seconds.
I'll take care of this.

41
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:02,041
No, listen...

42
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:06,200
You have interesting theories but
time has not stopped that much.

43
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:09,405
- You won't abandon me here?
- I will.

44
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:11,428
Good luck for the trial.

45
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:28,190
- Excuse me but where are you going?
- To my hotel.

46
00:04:28,314 --> 00:04:29,305
That way!

47
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:30,941
I know!

48
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:07,134
- Good evening!
- Good evening!

49
00:05:07,543 --> 00:05:09,134
May I?... Excuse me.

50
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,067
What are you doing?

51
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:19,202
Securing the area.

52
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:23,610
The usual routine.

53
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:42,640
Excuse me but without interfering
with your professional ethics

54
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:45,752
I'm tired and I'll free you now.

55
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:49,594
I'd like you to let me know of
your agenda for the day every morning,

56
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:52,300
where you go and the names
of the people you are to see.

57
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,147
- Christophe... That's your name, right?
- Yes.

58
00:05:56,272 --> 00:06:00,898
You can secure all the areas you want
but I have nothing to let you know of.

59
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:03,079
I don't need a body guard.

60
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,193
I'll phone Mr. Lassalle tomorrow.

61
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:08,284
In case of trouble, you ring me.

62
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:09,989
I'm in the next room.

63
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,189
Now... wait...

64
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,100
You're in the next room?

65
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:18,053
That's on my schedule.

66
00:06:18,736 --> 00:06:19,805
Want to check?

67
00:06:20,122 --> 00:06:21,396
No... no.

68
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:25,305
I'm here to help you, Mrs. Lassalle.

69
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:27,395
I won't win the case without you.

70
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,033
I can defend myself on my own.

71
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,334
I've told my son so.

72
00:06:33,548 --> 00:06:38,117
Right... Can you tell me
how you intend to defend yourself.

73
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:39,401
I don't.

74
00:06:42,425 --> 00:06:46,108
mrs Lassalloe...
Let's get acquainted first.

75
00:06:46,482 --> 00:06:50,815
We won't go into details. I just need
to know what you feel about the events.

76
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:54,209
Have you got a cigarette?

77
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:56,901
No, but I can go get one.

78
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,143
Thank you.

79
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:00,379
Your son doesn't bring you cigarettes?

80
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:02,730
He doesn't come often.

81
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,414
- Have you got a cigarette?
- I only have black tobacco.

82
00:07:21,653 --> 00:07:22,660
That will do.

83
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:28,304
Thank you very much.

84
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:34,254
The doctor who examined you said
your face was bruised.

85
00:07:35,594 --> 00:07:38,807
Dimitri Datchev attacked you
before you knifed him.

86
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:40,253
Didn't he?

87
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:43,513
No, I struck first.

88
00:07:57,969 --> 00:07:58,869
So?

89
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,874
Look, Mr. Lassalle, I'll tell you the truth,

90
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:02,713
it won't be easy.

91
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:05,683
Yeah... I'd told you.
My mother can be quite difficult.

92
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:08,318
- She told me she didn't see you much.
- She refuses to see me.

93
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:10,781
She must save her. Against herself.

94
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:13,495
The case is complicated.
I can't work miracles.

95
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,116
Yet... your... reputation.

96
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:19,055
Let's go in the car.

97
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:30,310
Outside we were at risk.

98
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:32,999
You were not threatened, were you?

99
00:08:33,189 --> 00:08:34,439
I was. Anonymous letters.

100
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:36,939
Because of that,
Roberto does not leave me.

101
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:38,401
You have one too?

102
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:41,692
I meant to tell you...
I don't need any one.

103
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:44,054
Listen... you must feel safe.

104
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:47,620
Dimitri Datchev's brothers arrived
in Monaco yesterday.

105
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:49,879
You know as well as I that
Russians are dangerous.

106
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,406
You don't have to follow me
in here, do you?

107
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,089
I must be no farther than 6 yards.

108
00:09:03,796 --> 00:09:05,327
Six yards? Why six?

109
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,826
That's the rule.

110
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:24,098
Won't you have dinner?

111
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:34,217
Having someone behind you
all the time is unpleasant.

112
00:09:34,522 --> 00:09:35,575
I understand.

113
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,866
Please, come and sit here.
It will be better that way.

114
00:09:59,926 --> 00:10:02,511
- Won't you order something?
- I've got a sandwich.

115
00:10:04,114 --> 00:10:06,169
- And where is your sandwich?
- In my room.

116
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:09,805
- When will you eat it?
- When you're sleeping.

117
00:10:10,802 --> 00:10:12,257
Pretend I'm not here.

118
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:14,765
Not easy.

119
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,056
The first quality of a S. O.
is to remain unnoticed.

120
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:19,050
S. O.?

121
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,727
Security Officer.

122
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:30,311
- What are you looking at?
- I'm working.

123
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:33,469
Slavs sighted?

124
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:36,797
Slavs or not, if you see anything
suspect, tell me about it.

125
00:10:40,445 --> 00:10:42,270
I'd like to see the expert's report.

126
00:10:42,713 --> 00:10:44,880
<i>It was number 113, right?</i>

127
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:45,944
<i>Yes.</i>

128
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,314
Here it is.

129
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:49,407
Wait!

130
00:10:49,763 --> 00:10:51,524
I also found this.

131
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,807
- What is it?
- An Italian porn magazine.

132
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,691
Nice of you. But not for me.

133
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:01,105
Dimitri Datchev...
was elected stud of the month.

134
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:05,211
It's quite impressive.

135
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:09,617
You think those giant balls will help
us build a defense case?

136
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,122
May I have a coffee?

137
00:11:14,663 --> 00:11:16,315
I'm working for Mr. Beauvois.

138
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:34,045
Bertrand!

139
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:47,296
- What are you doing here?
- In Paris, they told me you were here.

140
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:49,528
I couldn't wait.
I had to see you.

141
00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:51,559
I've left that dumb ass.

142
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:55,954
You did?

143
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,088
What's your room number?

144
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:02,393
Could you take
my luggage to the room, please?

145
00:12:05,745 --> 00:12:07,520
I threw my phone up into his face.

146
00:12:09,135 --> 00:12:10,431
Tore up his retina...

147
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,953
<i>You didn't!
- I did!</i>

148
00:12:12,969 --> 00:12:14,536
How is he feeling now?

149
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,461
Reserved prognosis.

150
00:12:17,245 --> 00:12:18,517
What are you swallowing?

151
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:20,892
Xanax. But I don't want
to kill myself now.

152
00:12:21,017 --> 00:12:23,266
- That's good news.
- I owe it to you.

153
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,622
What you told me last
time is wonderful.

154
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,968
- What did I tell you?
- About waiting, loveplay...

155
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:32,752
- Few men can say those things.
- Many do, many.

156
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,086
- No, no...
- Yes, yes...

157
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:37,317
All with their stupid machismo.
And after, nothing.

158
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:40,061
- Uncompromising, aren't you?
- Is it wrong?

159
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:42,815
No, that's not it...
Only... Hélène, be nice...

160
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:46,303
I'd like to talk about your husband.
What's the prognosis?

161
00:12:48,377 --> 00:12:50,200
You're plumper than I thought.

162
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:51,885
It deteriorated quite suddenly.

163
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,933
- You know what? - Yes...
- I want oysters, champagne...

164
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:57,276
I want plenty of champagne!

165
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:02,602
Mixing xanax and champagne is crazy!

166
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:07,917
You've got a problem?

167
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:10,317
Not at all.

168
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:22,313
What's the score?

169
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:23,487
Zero zero.

170
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:25,523
Is Piccione playing?

171
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:27,947
You pronounce it "Piccione"?

172
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,900
- What do you say?
- Piccion'

173
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,736
- Is he playing?
- Yes.

174
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:46,873
If that woman stays in my room,
there will be awful problems.

175
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,908
- Tell her to leave.
- You don't know her. She won't.

176
00:13:50,827 --> 00:13:52,317
<i>Bertrand, come quickly...</i>

177
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:54,390
Can you hear? Can you hear?

178
00:13:54,904 --> 00:13:55,969
Frightening!

179
00:13:57,719 --> 00:14:01,046
Ten minutes from now, you knock
at my door and say I'm asked for.

180
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:03,018
I count on you.

181
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,593
<i>Be nice, Hélène,</i>

182
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,457
that case I'm working on
is very difficult

183
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,636
In Paris,
you came on to me all the same.

184
00:14:18,016 --> 00:14:20,121
Yes but here... the stakes are high.

185
00:14:20,857 --> 00:14:22,781
You are a clever woman...
You are indeed...

186
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,314
If you're clever,
you must understand...

187
00:14:25,438 --> 00:14:27,382
Stop blabbering.

188
00:14:27,871 --> 00:14:30,135
Listen to me please...
Please, listen!

189
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:34,708
How can I tell... I'm the victim
of an incapacitating pathology...

190
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,788
We don't care.
I'm here for you...

191
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:40,753
- There are phases. You get it? phases...
- What phases?

192
00:14:41,738 --> 00:14:46,144
When I met you, I was going through
a period of intense exaltation

193
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,237
I was available but today...

194
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:51,042
Today I'm racked by doubt.

195
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,409
Please, listen, Hélène...

196
00:14:57,533 --> 00:15:00,651
I fear we'll get into a situation that is
quite far from your expectations

197
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:04,071
which seem to be very high.

198
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:09,627
My cycles are very conflicting and not
compatible with erotic availibility.

199
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:11,553
With what?

200
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:16,510
- Erotic availibilty.
- Erotic?

201
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:20,732
- What are you talking about?
- It may not be the right word.

202
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:26,888
Without being indiscret
how did you and your friend part?

203
00:15:27,304 --> 00:15:28,650
None of your business.

204
00:15:29,188 --> 00:15:31,623
Hélène... I think
you can still make up with him.

205
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:35,445
He loves you. That's quite sure.
Men know how to forgive.

206
00:15:35,849 --> 00:15:39,056
Get him on the phone.
Tell him you made a mistake.

207
00:15:39,423 --> 00:15:41,199
I'll dial the number.

208
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,894
Which is it?
You must dial zero first.

209
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:50,238
You don't know how much you need him.

210
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:01,811
I know it's not part of the job but

211
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:04,882
you should take care of that woman.
- What do you mean?

212
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:08,016
- She's remarkable, you know.
- What do you want me to do?

213
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:11,005
She is not well. Prevent her
from doing something wrong,

214
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,408
tell her I'm really not a man
for her. Use your insight.

215
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:18,617
- Right. - You look reassuring
to women. I can feel it.

216
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,601
- I'm not sure.
- Yes, believe me. It's a gift.

217
00:16:21,728 --> 00:16:25,139
Can't be explained. Quite unfair
actually. I trust you. Go!

218
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:27,576
Go! I'll wait for you
in your room.

219
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:31,227
I'll see what I can do.

220
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:06,807
Tomorrow morning, a depression coming
from the north will bring rain all day.

221
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:09,880
Heavy clouds will gather
above our principality.

222
00:17:11,816 --> 00:17:15,144
In a few days, I promise,
a softer air will close in on you.

223
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,692
Summer will start showing its nose

224
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,299
and everything will be much better.

225
00:17:34,296 --> 00:17:35,310
Coffee, sir?

226
00:17:36,242 --> 00:17:37,283
Yes.

227
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:48,586
Thank you very much.

228
00:17:49,724 --> 00:17:51,584
- She's still there?
- She's gone.

229
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:54,233
<i>- Where did she go?
- To Paris.</i>

230
00:17:56,056 --> 00:17:57,892
If I may, I'll use my bathroom.

231
00:17:58,149 --> 00:17:59,116
Please do.

232
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,327
It wasn't too difficult?

233
00:18:10,878 --> 00:18:12,883
<i>- No!
- What did you tell her?</i>

234
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:14,950
We didn't speak much.

235
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:18,769
- Can you tell me how...
- Very good.

236
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:21,424
What was very good?

237
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,740
She only needed solace.

238
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:30,163
And how did you do that?

239
00:18:31,338 --> 00:18:32,744
I did what was necessary.

240
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,003
<i>- You went to bed with her?
- A little</i>

241
00:18:38,472 --> 00:18:40,064
That's not what I asked you to do.

242
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:42,672
Sorry if I misunderstood.

243
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:44,569
How did you manage?

244
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:46,623
It happened.

245
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,181
It is that simple for you...

246
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:54,290
- I shouldn't have?
- Yes, yes.

247
00:18:54,939 --> 00:18:57,168
Yes. You were very professional.

248
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:03,566
For you, it's simple, I guess.
You see a girl,

249
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:07,093
you like her, you go to bed
with her. You find it natural.

250
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:09,581
It's the aim, isn't it?

251
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,290
Have you ever wondered
why we go to bed.

252
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:17,194
<i>- No.
Well, you should.</i>

253
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:19,338
We're told lots of stories.

254
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:22,924
That things will be wonderful.
Most of the time it's a disappointment.

255
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:25,911
Yet, it's life.

256
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:29,414
"On the deserted beach... "

257
00:19:31,494 --> 00:19:34,017
"all the shellfish,... "

258
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:38,776
"who would have thought so,
wish summer were still here. "

259
00:19:40,061 --> 00:19:41,529
"But it is over now. "

260
00:19:42,043 --> 00:19:44,444
Thanks for your advice, Audrey.
See you tomorrow.

261
00:19:44,568 --> 00:19:48,752
Defense lawyer Bertrand Beauvois is our
guest. We thank him for being here.

262
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:54,029
Can you tell us why you accepted
to defend Mrs. Lassalle?

263
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,667
I never know why I accept
a case but what I

264
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:03,534
can say is that nothing in Edith Lassalle's
life could let us foresee such tragedy.

265
00:20:06,157 --> 00:20:07,199
<i>Wait!</i>

266
00:20:09,315 --> 00:20:10,685
Hey, what are you doing here?

267
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:13,660
- I'm working.
- You two are together.

268
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:16,304
- Hello!
- Hello!

269
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:18,422
Your hair looks nice that way.

270
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:21,347
It's your first case in Monaco?

271
00:20:22,032 --> 00:20:22,876
Yes!

272
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:24,258
Welcome on the rock!

273
00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:38,914
Shellfish on the beach, not today!

274
00:20:39,378 --> 00:20:42,817
Quiet! I'm not given the right cards.
I must invent. It's not a real science!

275
00:20:43,516 --> 00:20:45,705
I saw you singing "la gadoue".
That was great!

276
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:49,193
Thanks! It's pleasant to hear this.
No one ever says anything.

277
00:20:50,136 --> 00:20:51,531
Right! I'll be on my way!

278
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,381
We'll phone, right?
Goodbye, sir!

279
00:20:56,957 --> 00:20:58,069
Bye!

280
00:20:58,976 --> 00:21:00,016
She's fun!

281
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,992
She's a girl from here!
Typical!

282
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:04,658
Typical? Why?

283
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:06,727
<i>That sort of girl is everywhere!</i>

284
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:09,333
You seem to know each other well!

285
00:21:10,697 --> 00:21:12,827
- You had something with her?
- Can say that!

286
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:25,694
Are you coming, Sir?

287
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:39,528
Thank you.

288
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,902
Do you mind if I stay in the courtroom?

289
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:43,409
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

290
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:45,975
<i>I must remind you that
he was knifed 17 times.</i>

291
00:21:47,494 --> 00:21:50,480
<i>Those photographs say much
more than any preferment.</i>

292
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:53,124
According to the coroner,

293
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:56,153
the victim, though seriously wounded,

294
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,588
tried to escape his murderer.

295
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:05,185
<i>Don't forget, Your Honors, what's
at stake here, in this Court,</i>

296
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:08,202
<i>A man, Dimitri Datchev, knifed to death,</i>

297
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:13,231
<i>a murderer who kept going at her victim
with extraordinary violence</i>

298
00:22:16,449 --> 00:22:18,639
<i>...we detailed the autopsy report...</i>

299
00:22:22,229 --> 00:22:24,652
<i>What we know is that,
after Italy,</i>

300
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:28,936
Dimitri was hired as a waiter
at Hotel Mirabeau.

301
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,791
How long?

302
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,383
<i>It doesn't say.</i>

303
00:22:32,507 --> 00:22:34,022
He didn't stay.

304
00:22:34,464 --> 00:22:36,422
Afterwards he was washing
dishes at the "47".

305
00:22:36,547 --> 00:22:37,793
What's the "47"?

306
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:39,091
A night-club.

307
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,712
<i>You go there?</i>

308
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:43,002
I worked there at security.

309
00:22:46,752 --> 00:22:49,813
You see that space behind the column?
We call it the widows' corner.

310
00:22:50,389 --> 00:22:53,165
It was Dimitri's hunting ground.
He met Edith Lassalle there.

311
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:57,242
It's appalling! Having to bear
that noise at 60!

312
00:23:00,498 --> 00:23:02,064
You've seen that woman?

313
00:23:03,194 --> 00:23:05,471
You noticed how strange
her hairdo is?

314
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,857
The anxiety you feel.

315
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:12,275
You feel how lonely she is.

316
00:23:13,082 --> 00:23:14,845
She's not unhappy.
She's into her thing.

317
00:23:15,488 --> 00:23:17,581
That's right. We always lay
too much about things.

318
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:21,662
- That Peugeot is yours?
- Yeah!

319
00:23:21,995 --> 00:23:22,988
Can you move it?

320
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:25,182
I'm not sure I can leave...

321
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:27,495
- You trust me?
- Yes.

322
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,781
Well... Go!

323
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,664
Guess who!

324
00:23:53,189 --> 00:23:55,454
I'm "la gadoue"
Remember?

325
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:58,880
I recognized your back.

326
00:23:59,236 --> 00:24:01,315
What are you doing here?
Not chasing girls?

327
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,150
Why? I'm too old?

328
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,342
Almost.

329
00:24:05,273 --> 00:24:07,634
- You always say what you think.
- I shouldn't?

330
00:24:08,663 --> 00:24:10,468
Yes, yes. It's risky though.

331
00:24:11,435 --> 00:24:12,855
- You're Aquarius, aren't you?
- Yes.

332
00:24:13,455 --> 00:24:15,107
I must be wary of Aquarius.

333
00:24:15,718 --> 00:24:17,065
Aren't you thirsty? I am...

334
00:24:18,992 --> 00:24:19,984
Yes, I'm thirsty.

335
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,594
I'm with friends over there.
They'd like to meet you.

336
00:24:24,084 --> 00:24:25,993
- Yeah?
- Guess who won the shoes'contest?

337
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,780
- Fabio!
- No, I did!

338
00:24:36,515 --> 00:24:38,964
Let me! I'll take off your shirt.

339
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,180
- Why?
- I'll clean it in the sink.

340
00:24:41,303 --> 00:24:43,883
- I'll give it at the hotel.
- Why? You're embarrassed?

341
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:46,160
You keep your socks on the beach?

342
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:49,874
- I rarely go to the beach.
- Cute! You've got goose pimples.

343
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,605
You've got a baby's skin.
You should share it!

344
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:55,689
What's going on here?

345
00:24:56,515 --> 00:24:59,672
Could you find a shirt, Christophe?

346
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:01,863
A shirt?

347
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:10,469
Imagine what he thought...
seeing us there.

348
00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:12,439
He thought nothing of it.

349
00:25:12,871 --> 00:25:15,110
Why? You don't think it possible,
you and I?

350
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:19,822
No answer? Cat got your tongue?

351
00:25:20,232 --> 00:25:22,032
Audrey? What are you doing?
Hurry!

352
00:25:22,423 --> 00:25:24,294
Can you lend your shirt to my friend?

353
00:25:26,868 --> 00:25:28,263
I shouldn't have left you.

354
00:25:29,218 --> 00:25:31,629
- You see: I survived!
- What did she say to you?

355
00:25:31,926 --> 00:25:35,096
Crazy things!
She's got her own language.

356
00:25:35,415 --> 00:25:38,157
- You can say that indeed.
- You're harsh.

357
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:40,678
- Do you know how she got that job on tv?
- No.

358
00:25:41,355 --> 00:25:44,758
She was in a disgusting reality show,
"The diva of love". Do you know it?

359
00:25:44,884 --> 00:25:46,999
- No.
- You can't imagine what she did to win.

360
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,697
- You got a light?
- I don't smoke.

361
00:25:56,412 --> 00:25:58,187
- I know you, don't I?
- I don't...

362
00:25:58,312 --> 00:26:00,182
Please, Sir!
Sir!

363
00:26:04,102 --> 00:26:05,741
Move on! Move on!

364
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:09,721
Why did you do that?
He is harmless.

365
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,454
- He was drunk!
- He was too close.

366
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,821
- I had to act.
- You're impressive when angry.

367
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,220
- You scared me!
- Not what I meant to do!

368
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:23,863
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I must say that Mrs Lassalle

369
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,646
is not used to
going to that sort of place.

370
00:26:27,257 --> 00:26:29,988
She lived away from the world
and did not see many people.

371
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:34,616
But she was probably not
satisfied by her life.

372
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,925
When she gets into the "47"
that evening,

373
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:41,939
she is vulnerable and very lonely.

374
00:26:43,005 --> 00:26:45,686
Quickly, Mr. Datchev sees her.

375
00:26:46,177 --> 00:26:50,914
He looks at her jewels.
An organized predator, he plans.

376
00:26:51,637 --> 00:26:56,311
The first night, he won't talk about
money. He'll even pay for everything.

377
00:26:56,685 --> 00:26:58,166
<i>- He is a professional.
- Sir!</i>

378
00:27:02,168 --> 00:27:04,848
I forbid you to talk
that way about the events.

379
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,070
- I'll explain.
- There's nothing to explain.

380
00:27:08,343 --> 00:27:11,048
- You'll stop and that'll be it.
- Let me.

381
00:27:21,046 --> 00:27:22,086
Fine?

382
00:27:24,404 --> 00:27:25,847
Started a long time ago?
- Yeah.

383
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:28,259
Counselor... Can you go on?

384
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,545
Yes, Your Honor.

385
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,254
The very reluctance Mrs Lassalle shows...

386
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,658
You read the papers?
Your boss is quite famous!

387
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,747
Ah, there you are!

388
00:27:46,775 --> 00:27:48,085
Can I see him?
- You can't.

389
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:50,129
- Why?
- He mustn't be disturbed.

390
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:53,646
- Seems you like your job.
- It's o. k.

391
00:27:54,355 --> 00:27:56,717
I've still got your blue pull over.

392
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,874
I'll give it back to you.
It's too nice for me anyway.

393
00:28:01,424 --> 00:28:02,527
Good evening.

394
00:28:04,742 --> 00:28:06,615
It was extraordinary.

395
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:10,016
Your presence when you plea
is mind-blowing.

396
00:28:10,446 --> 00:28:11,435
Plead.

397
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:15,022
The way you throw words,
the way you speak...

398
00:28:16,307 --> 00:28:18,841
When you say "alcoholic",

399
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:21,012
we can hear the glasses tinkling.

400
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,954
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

401
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:27,430
You got a minute? I must tell you
of a thing. Very important.

402
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,256
You didn't kill anyone?

403
00:28:33,124 --> 00:28:35,414
- You swear you won't tell?
- Of course.

404
00:28:35,538 --> 00:28:37,121
- I swear, Audrey?
- I swear, Audrey.

405
00:28:37,244 --> 00:28:39,334
- With your hand?
- I swear, Audrey.

406
00:28:40,265 --> 00:28:43,177
There's no risk. I already
submitted my idea, so...

407
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,413
You'll understand...

408
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:48,081
- Come! We're going to the sea...
- Yeah, cool!

409
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,441
Are you coming?
... Come on, do!

410
00:28:50,736 --> 00:28:52,377
I must prepare for tomorrow.

411
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:54,964
I've still got plenty to tell you.

412
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,621
- It's not too far?
- No, it's quite close.

413
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,796
- We can go, can't we?
- You've got at an appointment at 20:00.

414
00:29:03,683 --> 00:29:06,337
Once a week, I must cover an event
that occurred in Monaco.

415
00:29:06,463 --> 00:29:07,525
Anything.

416
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:11,650
Only a 3 minute subject after the weather
but I do what I want.

417
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,844
- Do I "pitch" my idea?
- Pitch!

418
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,355
The celebrities' pets.
What do you think of it?

419
00:29:18,201 --> 00:29:21,027
The celebrities' pets... Indeed.

420
00:29:21,337 --> 00:29:23,455
I sweated blood to say it.
Like it?

421
00:29:23,773 --> 00:29:26,294
- Not bad!
- I was sure of it. We're in sync.

422
00:29:26,906 --> 00:29:30,298
Now... If you say pet, you say
master. Right or wrong?

423
00:29:30,546 --> 00:29:32,491
- Right.
- Now, that's where it gets great...

424
00:29:32,615 --> 00:29:35,465
I ask someone famous to tell
about his cat or dog.

425
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:38,990
I need the celebrities now.
Barthez agrees.

426
00:29:39,483 --> 00:29:45,222
His parrot imitates a brazilian
commentator and shouts: Goooooal!

427
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:51,945
What I'd like to know is if it's lawful
without getting the pet's permission.

428
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:57,098
I'm not a specialist of animals'
copyright but I feel...

429
00:29:57,223 --> 00:29:59,399
Come! Come, it's ready!

430
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:06,232
It's great here, isn't it?
You see those clouds there?

431
00:30:06,696 --> 00:30:09,230
Means the mistral will blow all week.

432
00:30:09,355 --> 00:30:11,115
You can say it on tv.

433
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:14,681
If it was a tsunami... They'd open
the news with my forecast.

434
00:30:15,744 --> 00:30:17,496
Come! I know a nice spot.

435
00:30:20,656 --> 00:30:23,385
- You want sardines?
- No, not when I'm working.

436
00:30:24,977 --> 00:30:26,910
Nothing ever happens here anyway.

437
00:30:27,582 --> 00:30:29,234
Nothing can be great.

438
00:30:29,748 --> 00:30:31,682
And your forecast is important.

439
00:30:32,404 --> 00:30:35,721
Whole destinies can change
because of a light wind,

440
00:30:36,591 --> 00:30:38,549
a light breeze, some rain.

441
00:30:38,831 --> 00:30:41,205
You know of Sartre
and Simone de Beauvoir?

442
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,624
They first met in a café.

443
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:50,373
That day, there was rain,
a fine rain, almost nothing.

444
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,166
He said: let's stop here,
it's raining.

445
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:59,184
And they remained 40 years together.
You realize?

446
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:04,386
One of the most famous couples of the XXth
Century started on what? Nothing.

447
00:31:05,303 --> 00:31:08,681
A few drops of rain.
So nothing can mean everything.

448
00:31:09,486 --> 00:31:11,458
You never let go?

449
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,783
I was trying to widen the scope.

450
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:16,124
Undress and let's go for a swim.

451
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:22,487
You coming?

452
00:31:34,866 --> 00:31:36,273
It's getting late.

453
00:31:37,681 --> 00:31:40,166
- I don't like water at all.
- Don't go!

454
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:42,210
Water's great!

455
00:31:44,585 --> 00:31:46,407
Come on! Undress!

456
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,121
<i>It'll do you good.</i>

457
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,056
<i>It will sting!</i>

458
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,468
That's it. I'll dress it.

459
00:32:02,957 --> 00:32:06,971
Strangely enough, I had a good time.
Those guys are disarming.

460
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,219
Can you try and walk?

461
00:32:13,895 --> 00:32:16,110
I feel all right.
Want a drink?

462
00:32:16,832 --> 00:32:17,970
<i>No thanks. I'm all right.</i>

463
00:32:18,852 --> 00:32:22,658
Audrey... I don't know.
I can't understand what she is.

464
00:32:24,334 --> 00:32:25,790
Do you want a piece?

465
00:32:26,636 --> 00:32:27,687
Thank you.

466
00:32:30,318 --> 00:32:32,143
There may be nothing to understand.

467
00:32:36,703 --> 00:32:38,038
How did you do with her?

468
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:40,020
Simple.

469
00:32:40,422 --> 00:32:42,150
What do you mean, simple?

470
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,307
Straight to the point.

471
00:32:46,993 --> 00:32:50,836
You're not interested in her, are you?
Because, except for...

472
00:32:51,644 --> 00:32:53,406
- You have a problem with it?
- No,

473
00:32:53,981 --> 00:32:55,096
no problem.

474
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,787
You had a long relationship with her?

475
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:01,329
No.

476
00:33:02,888 --> 00:33:05,594
- Six months, a year?
- Much less.

477
00:33:07,355 --> 00:33:10,647
Short but intense...
Sexually, I mean.

478
00:33:11,227 --> 00:33:13,394
No complaint there.
Not bad.

479
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:16,590
Coming from you, that's a compliment.

480
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,258
Yes.

481
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:41,127
- We'd better not stay.
- I told you so.

482
00:33:41,878 --> 00:33:42,870
<i>Bertrand!</i>

483
00:33:46,786 --> 00:33:48,524
You came! It's cool!

484
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,226
Hi!

485
00:33:50,352 --> 00:33:52,404
I'll introduce you to my parents.

486
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:54,143
They will be proud.

487
00:33:55,526 --> 00:33:57,485
They redecorated.
You like?

488
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:01,456
Mum, dad... Bertrand.

489
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:07,591
Very kind of you to come, Sir.

490
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,329
Conselor, Mum... Counselor.

491
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:11,286
Pass the video camera.

492
00:34:11,412 --> 00:34:12,769
Go all around him.

493
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:18,561
Turn towards Bertrand.
Move, Christopher. You're in the picture.

494
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,146
Can you smile, Bertrand?

495
00:34:24,054 --> 00:34:25,400
Great! Fantastic!

496
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,579
We lost him.
He'll be mad.

497
00:34:33,845 --> 00:34:36,122
That's it! My place!

498
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,062
Come in.

499
00:34:45,026 --> 00:34:47,472
What will you have?
Malibu? Sky?

500
00:34:49,651 --> 00:34:51,060
- Sky.
- O. k.

501
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,507
You like her?

502
00:35:00,196 --> 00:35:03,036
A lot.
When she died, I had a revelation.

503
00:35:03,563 --> 00:35:06,474
When she died, she had everything.
I had nothing but I was alive.

504
00:35:06,768 --> 00:35:10,780
I started smiling, laughing, pretending
I was the most beautiful girl in the world.

505
00:35:10,907 --> 00:35:12,214
And they all believed it.

506
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:13,986
Of course.

507
00:35:14,824 --> 00:35:16,230
What does it inspire you?

508
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:20,552
You're not your usual self.
You say yes, you say no.

509
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,146
You talk much more usually.

510
00:35:23,823 --> 00:35:24,985
I'm listening to you.

511
00:35:29,308 --> 00:35:31,854
When I saw you on tv,
it triggered something inside me.

512
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,854
I felt tinglings.

513
00:35:35,404 --> 00:35:36,751
I believe in meetings.

514
00:35:37,658 --> 00:35:38,883
It's in my karma.

515
00:35:39,568 --> 00:35:42,163
- Karma! You mean chance?
- No,

516
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,177
There's no such thing as chance.

517
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:47,318
Since you've been here,
everything is cool.

518
00:35:47,968 --> 00:35:49,290
Is that chance?

519
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:08,456
I can't believe it. A real watch dog!

520
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:09,937
Let's go, counselor!

521
00:36:10,062 --> 00:36:12,556
- What is it, Christophe?
- I can't believe it.

522
00:36:12,825 --> 00:36:14,135
You plan on staying here?

523
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,106
For now, yes.

524
00:36:16,544 --> 00:36:19,249
- Is it a problem to you?
- I must search the place.

525
00:36:21,122 --> 00:36:22,920
<i>This is ridiculous, Christophe.</i>

526
00:36:32,081 --> 00:36:33,488
Right? Are you finished?

527
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:39,008
- Raise your arms.
- You overdo it a little.

528
00:36:40,259 --> 00:36:43,625
Any stranger staying with you
must be security checked.

529
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:48,128
- Avoid the palpations.
- No, no problem.

530
00:36:50,868 --> 00:36:52,985
It's a trick to grope girls.

531
00:36:54,197 --> 00:36:56,047
- Go straight at it.
- I know it all.

532
00:36:56,669 --> 00:36:57,919
You didn't say so once.

533
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:02,243
- It's all right, Sir.
- Now go and have fun!

534
00:37:04,763 --> 00:37:05,815
I'll be downstairs.

535
00:37:41,283 --> 00:37:42,495
Seems a bit fast to me.

536
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,432
I don't know why we're waiting.

537
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:49,338
It's fast. I assure you.
Really fast.

538
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,698
I don't want you to be disappointed.
My sexuality is not exceptional.

539
00:38:10,717 --> 00:38:11,784
Take me in the ass.

540
00:38:16,532 --> 00:38:17,574
Straight out!

541
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:22,668
<i>Christophe.</i>

542
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:29,746
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

543
00:38:30,297 --> 00:38:32,463
- I fell asleep.
- Don't you notice anything?

544
00:38:33,347 --> 00:38:34,644
- No.
- Look at me.

545
00:38:35,551 --> 00:38:37,985
- I can see you.
- What just happened is not human.

546
00:38:38,932 --> 00:38:42,653
If you knew what she did to me,
what she invented all night long.

547
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:46,509
That curved body,
shameless, boundless...

548
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:49,888
It never stopped.

549
00:38:50,737 --> 00:38:53,137
There's pleasure and nothing else.
Incredible!

550
00:38:54,115 --> 00:38:55,412
You fucked, no more.

551
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:58,867
Exactly.

552
00:39:00,727 --> 00:39:04,032
What I try to make the Court
understand, Mrs Lassalle,

553
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:07,214
is that, before meeting Mr Datchev,

554
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,698
the life you led was perfectly
organized.

555
00:39:10,823 --> 00:39:12,963
Everything was controled, planned.

556
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,247
You wanted to be protected from
the slightest unevenness.

557
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:19,161
from the slightest slip.

558
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:22,231
When he came, everything changed.

559
00:39:23,749 --> 00:39:25,550
You lost your head, Mrs. Lassalle.

560
00:39:26,518 --> 00:39:28,257
You were confronted to feelings,

561
00:39:28,623 --> 00:39:32,627
emotions that, for the first time,
you could not control.

562
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:36,165
Something alive was taking you away.

563
00:39:37,795 --> 00:39:41,062
You let everything go.
You didn't control things any more.

564
00:39:44,165 --> 00:39:48,094
What did you do in the hours
that followed Mr. Datchev's death?

565
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:52,266
I wanted to go see my daughter
living in Paris but I couldn't.

566
00:39:54,486 --> 00:39:55,406
Why?

567
00:39:58,052 --> 00:40:00,512
As soon he saw the body,
my son called the police.

568
00:40:02,092 --> 00:40:03,414
I wouldn't have run away.

569
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:07,856
My only regret is not
to have seen my daughter.

570
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:14,070
I think you're quite optimistic.
Her last sentence left a bad impression.

571
00:40:14,427 --> 00:40:17,389
You didn't understand.
Something opened today.

572
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:20,019
She looked fragile and
everybody saw it.

573
00:40:20,607 --> 00:40:23,375
For the first time, I saw
I could break her shell.

574
00:40:23,965 --> 00:40:26,695
Stop being a killjoy.
We're making progress.

575
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,101
See you, Alain.

576
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,365
Do you know
where I could find a sword?

577
00:40:31,981 --> 00:40:34,100
Hello, welcome
to the pirates' night.

578
00:40:37,757 --> 00:40:41,540
It's nice... exotic...
tropical.

579
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,638
We won't stay long, I promise you.

580
00:40:46,805 --> 00:40:48,518
Make an effort, Christophe.

581
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:51,211
Think of Gauguin,
of "Treasure island".

582
00:40:52,488 --> 00:40:54,446
It's a party
to promote industrial punch.

583
00:40:55,523 --> 00:40:58,644
How uptight you are. Enjoy!
The girls are beautiful!

584
00:40:59,702 --> 00:41:01,551
You're fine?
Nice necklace!

585
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:03,425
Where's Audrey?
Is she with you?

586
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:06,054
For Audrey, see Bouli,
he is in charge!

587
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:16,210
Excuse me... Are you Bouli?

588
00:41:16,337 --> 00:41:18,793
- Yes.
- Do you know where Audrey Is?

589
00:41:19,153 --> 00:41:21,247
With the people from tv,
over there.

590
00:41:21,371 --> 00:41:22,458
Thank you very much.

591
00:41:26,673 --> 00:41:28,128
She forgot all about you.

592
00:41:28,899 --> 00:41:30,907
She told me to come.
I'm sure she'll come.

593
00:41:31,421 --> 00:41:32,731
Now, she's working.

594
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:35,401
We're wasting our time here.

595
00:41:35,528 --> 00:41:37,116
Why are you such a naysayer?

596
00:41:42,307 --> 00:41:44,585
- Did she leave you?
- No.

597
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:48,171
Nothing to be ashamed of!
- She's not the kind of girl you leave.

598
00:41:49,223 --> 00:41:50,434
It works or it doesn't.

599
00:41:50,913 --> 00:41:52,135
Was it long ago?

600
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:54,200
- Two years.
- Quite recent then.

601
00:41:54,326 --> 00:41:56,477
Wait, I think she's calling me.

602
00:42:23,478 --> 00:42:24,912
That behavior is normal?

603
00:42:25,608 --> 00:42:26,992
It's normal. She's a whore.

604
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,587
No, it's somewhat extreme, but...

605
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:33,803
I usually have an intuition about women.
Here I don't know.

606
00:42:35,798 --> 00:42:37,633
She exposes herself. It's crazy.

607
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,427
I wonder
if you aren't making her run away.

608
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:49,101
Come on, move away. You said
6 yards. There aren't 6 yards.

609
00:42:55,735 --> 00:42:56,947
I'm joking, right?

610
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:08,383
We've got to go now.

611
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:22,308
I was looking for you everywhere.
I thought you'd left.

612
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:24,616
Come, I'll videotape you.

613
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,526
- Lord Nelson has left?
- Yes.

614
00:43:27,259 --> 00:43:28,164
This is ridiculous.

615
00:43:29,942 --> 00:43:33,247
Come on, jump!
Please, do it for me.

616
00:43:33,762 --> 00:43:34,961
Come on, do it!

617
00:43:36,066 --> 00:43:39,714
Come on, do it.
Please, do it for me.

618
00:43:40,864 --> 00:43:42,087
You're too cute.

619
00:43:56,561 --> 00:43:57,651
Then, to bed.

620
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,290
Sir... Sir...

621
00:44:32,098 --> 00:44:33,176
Can you hear me?

622
00:44:33,915 --> 00:44:35,543
Sir... You'll be all right.

623
00:44:35,825 --> 00:44:38,272
- Bertrand, are you all right?
- Enough bullshit. Get off!

624
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:41,308
I'll put you on your side.
Let me do it.

625
00:44:43,777 --> 00:44:44,829
That's it!

626
00:44:57,377 --> 00:44:58,993
I can't understand a word.

627
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:05,272
Right... Bring a microphone to
the defender so that we can hear.

628
00:45:05,645 --> 00:45:08,068
It's useless, I've lost my voice.

629
00:45:12,645 --> 00:45:13,664
Take this.

630
00:45:17,397 --> 00:45:19,122
Making love is not good for you, Sir.

631
00:45:19,738 --> 00:45:22,198
You're right, she's impossible.

632
00:45:23,459 --> 00:45:25,601
You're strong, you were able to resist.

633
00:45:25,725 --> 00:45:27,448
My health is not good enough. I can't.

634
00:45:29,569 --> 00:45:32,103
<i>See that yellow one?
It's an exoria poseida.</i>

635
00:45:32,627 --> 00:45:34,256
<i>It changes color for the love parade.</i>

636
00:45:36,618 --> 00:45:38,614
After mating, he can sleep a whole year.

637
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:39,974
He's lucky!

638
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,940
- You know a lot about marine life.
- I'm from Monaco.

639
00:45:45,045 --> 00:45:46,110
Thanks!

640
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:47,982
- It's a nice place.
- Yes.

641
00:45:49,355 --> 00:45:51,278
- So you were born here?
- Yes.

642
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:53,223
The whole family. On the Rock.

643
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:57,115
You've always had
so structured a life?

644
00:45:57,386 --> 00:46:00,261
No. I also got into trouble.
Nothing much.

645
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,660
You weren't there to plead.

646
00:46:04,414 --> 00:46:06,629
- What happened?
- Nothing much at first.

647
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:09,237
A fight outside a night club.

648
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:11,794
I hit the roof quickly at the time.

649
00:46:12,946 --> 00:46:14,722
Now you look so quiet.

650
00:46:15,468 --> 00:46:19,202
Thanks to my job.
Anger management, self control.

651
00:46:19,572 --> 00:46:21,236
No alcohol, Krav maga.

652
00:46:21,689 --> 00:46:22,939
- Krav what?
- Maga.

653
00:46:23,684 --> 00:46:25,153
It's hebrew. It means close combat.

654
00:46:26,414 --> 00:46:28,167
What are your usual customers?

655
00:46:29,365 --> 00:46:31,606
VIP's, business men,

656
00:46:32,252 --> 00:46:34,725
show biz, emirates...
It comes and goes.

657
00:46:35,973 --> 00:46:37,931
I rarely have real contacts with someone.

658
00:46:41,101 --> 00:46:44,222
- Thank you for everything.
- I'm only doing my job.

659
00:46:44,899 --> 00:46:46,269
It's much more than that.

660
00:46:47,151 --> 00:46:48,925
I want you to feel fine tomorrow.

661
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,794
- You must win that case.
- It's that important to you?

662
00:46:53,421 --> 00:46:55,526
Yes, you do something useful.

663
00:46:55,989 --> 00:46:57,887
You save people, guilty or not.

664
00:46:59,111 --> 00:47:01,254
It's good.
Tomorrow, hot lemon, right?

665
00:47:02,494 --> 00:47:04,991
Tomorrow, hot lemon,
no croissant.

666
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:09,632
The best lays are always
the guys who look uptight.

667
00:48:10,626 --> 00:48:13,809
I don't believe you.
You just want to be nice.

668
00:48:15,193 --> 00:48:17,161
And your appeal is an atomic bomb.

669
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:22,685
I'm glad you came.
My spirits were not really high.

670
00:48:24,807 --> 00:48:27,537
For the pets, it didn't work.
Barthez left me down.

671
00:48:27,927 --> 00:48:30,533
- He did?
- He didn't want to be filmed.

672
00:48:31,636 --> 00:48:33,667
His parrot bit me.
Bloody rat!

673
00:48:35,195 --> 00:48:36,726
I must find another idea.

674
00:48:38,427 --> 00:48:41,915
Demis Roussos has got a small bulldog.
But they're both in sleep therapy.

675
00:48:43,016 --> 00:48:45,134
I feel bad.
I don't know what to do.

676
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:51,769
<i>Your lover's there waiting.</i>

677
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:53,300
He is downstairs?

678
00:48:54,636 --> 00:48:57,708
Be careful. Soon he will
ask you to have sex.

679
00:48:59,738 --> 00:49:01,623
You know you must tell me
when you go away.

680
00:49:02,334 --> 00:49:04,929
She was not feeling well.
She's in trouble, you know.

681
00:49:05,517 --> 00:49:08,210
With her program: celebrities' pets.

682
00:49:08,909 --> 00:49:09,777
What?

683
00:49:09,902 --> 00:49:11,135
Celebrities' pets.

684
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,785
She was desperate, I feared that
she made some mistake.

685
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,416
Of course.

686
00:49:17,649 --> 00:49:19,939
I could not let her all night
with that sort of ideas.

687
00:49:36,672 --> 00:49:37,637
Hi there!

688
00:49:38,603 --> 00:49:41,334
- I didn't sleep at all.
- I had a great idea.

689
00:49:44,364 --> 00:49:47,411
Counselor Beauvois, can you tell us
who's your favorite criminal?

690
00:49:47,682 --> 00:49:49,161
Come on! It's ridiculous.

691
00:49:49,505 --> 00:49:53,189
Come on, pussy, if you wanted to,
you could save my life.

692
00:49:53,705 --> 00:49:55,175
I've already got the title.

693
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,593
"In Counselor Beauvois's gown. "
What do you think?

694
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:04,259
The idea is to be close to you,

695
00:50:04,492 --> 00:50:06,364
no taboo, no double talk because

696
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:09,350
the people don't know counselor
Beauvois under the gown.

697
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:11,802
Well, I'm the only one who knows.

698
00:50:12,598 --> 00:50:15,842
It would be like "The new star"

699
00:50:16,735 --> 00:50:18,400
but more on the legal side.

700
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:19,990
What do you think of it?

701
00:50:20,236 --> 00:50:22,646
A lawyer was never interesting
to anyone.

702
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:25,854
But Hubert, the announcer, thinks
it's great. Look!

703
00:50:29,811 --> 00:50:32,895
You're cute there, like a little boy.
No one has seen you that way.

704
00:50:33,261 --> 00:50:34,620
<i>I have a funny face, haven't I?</i>

705
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:38,478
<i>It's funny. You don't realize...</i>

706
00:50:38,721 --> 00:50:42,369
<i>We'll be together all the time.
I'll be with you 24/24.</i>

707
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:50,517
Cleaned and ironed.

708
00:50:51,325 --> 00:50:54,508
Christophe, room service
does that, you know?

709
00:50:54,741 --> 00:50:57,004
In the hotel.
- There it's perfect.

710
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,979
- Why are you looking at me?
- I'm not.

711
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,671
Move on... Vai, vai.

712
00:51:05,841 --> 00:51:06,942
I'll get the car.

713
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:24,685
It's nothing. Only a few minutes.

714
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,255
It's funny and it helps her.

715
00:51:30,051 --> 00:51:33,062
Trust me. I know when to stop.

716
00:51:34,017 --> 00:51:35,596
Don't look at the camera.

717
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:39,638
You have a look of concentration.
You're getting to work.

718
00:51:41,952 --> 00:51:43,028
Go to your desk.

719
00:51:44,399 --> 00:51:45,733
Slowly, sit down slowly.

720
00:51:47,475 --> 00:51:49,935
You open your files,
you look at them.

721
00:52:33,471 --> 00:52:35,112
Being here with you is moving.

722
00:52:36,212 --> 00:52:37,460
That's where it happened.

723
00:52:39,594 --> 00:52:40,806
Can you film us, please?

724
00:52:41,895 --> 00:52:44,074
All you have to do is press here.

725
00:52:45,338 --> 00:52:47,712
- You won't?
- It's not part of my job.

726
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:50,722
What's your job?
Why are you here?

727
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:52,525
Where are your mafiosi?

728
00:52:54,985 --> 00:52:56,564
Hell! I am not asking much.

729
00:52:57,164 --> 00:52:58,645
- Audrey!
- What, Audrey?

730
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:00,395
That moment would look great.

731
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,799
Look at the sight. That bastard
won't move his ass.

732
00:53:03,069 --> 00:53:04,464
You've got a real scoop!

733
00:53:04,903 --> 00:53:07,035
You never understood me.
You're an asshole.

734
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:09,273
Only college graduates
can understand you...

735
00:53:10,549 --> 00:53:11,699
It makes you laugh!

736
00:53:12,653 --> 00:53:14,024
I'm fed up! You're pissing me off!

737
00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:17,430
How long will it go on?

738
00:53:17,554 --> 00:53:19,779
- Listen...
- Stop telling yourself stories.

739
00:53:20,085 --> 00:53:23,782
Today, it's Princess Grace, tomorrow,
you'll be in your undies in the aquarium.

740
00:53:24,128 --> 00:53:26,112
You go on like this,
she'll ruin your case.

741
00:53:26,429 --> 00:53:28,694
You calm down,
don't speak to me that way.

742
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:30,689
I know what I must do.

743
00:53:30,814 --> 00:53:33,382
You'll go on like this, saying yes
to everything, like a girl.

744
00:53:33,837 --> 00:53:36,531
Don't you understand
she won't leave you alone?

745
00:53:37,399 --> 00:53:40,005
May I remind you you're paid
to watch my front door?

746
00:53:42,062 --> 00:53:44,891
If I needed a body guard for advice,
I'd know about it.

747
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,195
- You've been warned.
- What do you think?

748
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:49,602
That I can't do without you?

749
00:53:58,628 --> 00:54:02,361
What are you waiting for?
Will you drive me to the hotel?

750
00:54:10,014 --> 00:54:11,948
Well... I should get cross more often.

751
00:54:13,632 --> 00:54:16,117
- They had them in dark red.
- No, I love the color.

752
00:54:19,018 --> 00:54:20,547
Can you find a cigarette?

753
00:54:21,868 --> 00:54:22,885
Of course.

754
00:54:43,828 --> 00:54:45,626
I left the car in the parking.

755
00:54:47,469 --> 00:54:49,783
- I could not find any, darling.
- I took chewing gum.

756
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,466
Do you realize what's happening?

757
00:54:53,993 --> 00:54:55,216
It's not chance.

758
00:54:55,683 --> 00:54:57,934
When I spoke of karma...
That's what it is.

759
00:54:58,202 --> 00:55:00,529
Since I met you,
I've felt orange energy.

760
00:55:01,337 --> 00:55:04,788
It's fluid that goes there
and up to here.

761
00:55:05,462 --> 00:55:08,031
In the book of energies,
orange is the rarest color.

762
00:55:08,365 --> 00:55:11,278
In some lives, it never appears.
It's horrible, isn't it?

763
00:55:12,146 --> 00:55:14,326
- There are books on this?
- Yes.

764
00:55:15,623 --> 00:55:17,520
I like it when you listen to me.

765
00:55:19,077 --> 00:55:20,888
There's something we've not tried yet...

766
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,248
Yeah!

767
00:55:45,324 --> 00:55:46,831
Yeah, it's cool.
I'm asking.

768
00:55:47,394 --> 00:55:48,738
What's the room number?

769
00:56:08,964 --> 00:56:10,679
Come on, there's a surprise.

770
00:56:55,595 --> 00:56:57,283
Wait, you haven't seen the present yet.

771
00:56:57,409 --> 00:56:59,548
Where is it?
What is it?

772
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:10,876
Tell me, excuse me...
Where's Audrey?

773
00:57:11,842 --> 00:57:13,532
- She didn't tell you?
- Tell what?

774
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,696
Forget it! You've got a car?

775
00:57:17,014 --> 00:57:17,821
Yes.

776
00:57:42,937 --> 00:57:46,781
- I hope you didn't make a mess in my place.
- You'll thank us all your life.

777
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,781
Let's leave them. He's wanted
to have her for so long.

778
00:58:09,906 --> 00:58:10,957
To have whom?

779
00:58:11,082 --> 00:58:13,190
Audrey, he's the only one
who didn't have her.

780
00:58:13,735 --> 00:58:16,661
It's revolting.
Everyone can't have her.

781
00:58:16,786 --> 00:58:19,365
You've had her.
And it was not even your birthday.

782
00:58:35,646 --> 00:58:37,298
Where shall we go? To Nice?

783
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:46,971
The pill of love. Swallow it.
You'll feel better.

784
00:58:47,341 --> 00:58:48,406
It's not a good idea.

785
00:58:53,082 --> 00:58:55,701
You know the "Doux Sud" in Juan?
- No.

786
00:58:55,827 --> 00:58:57,578
Come on, start!
I'll tell you the way.

787
00:59:06,606 --> 00:59:08,211
Want me to drive?

788
00:59:57,232 --> 01:00:00,549
Counselor... I didn't know
you came to that sort of place.

789
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:04,614
Shall I buy you a drinlk?

790
01:00:05,656 --> 01:00:06,622
No, thanks.

791
01:00:07,602 --> 01:00:10,564
I wanted to talk to you. You know
I'll testify tomorrow.

792
01:00:11,725 --> 01:00:13,109
You don't look all right...

793
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,361
- Leave me alone.
- What's wrong with you?

794
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,652
You want me to go get your bodyguard?

795
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:20,561
Leave me alone.

796
01:00:21,555 --> 01:00:23,832
I hope that girl
is not too much trouble.

797
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:27,626
She's already left you?

798
01:00:29,869 --> 01:00:31,645
You're crazy! You're sick!

799
01:01:07,486 --> 01:01:09,958
I don't know what they made me
swallow in the tunnel.

800
01:01:11,897 --> 01:01:13,718
It's forbidden to pedestrians, right?

801
01:01:18,357 --> 01:01:20,487
She left me for that fat guy.

802
01:01:21,368 --> 01:01:23,352
You know that fat guy?

803
01:01:42,354 --> 01:01:45,633
I want to thank you.
Thank you very much.

804
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:47,628
Care for a coffee?

805
01:01:47,946 --> 01:01:49,024
Yes please.

806
01:01:52,316 --> 01:01:54,141
It's very tidy here.

807
01:01:56,147 --> 01:01:58,742
- How many square meters?
- 32.

808
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,392
<i>You lead a lonely life.</i>

809
01:02:02,771 --> 01:02:05,441
In my job, you must be
available 24/24

810
01:02:06,028 --> 01:02:07,532
You can't have a family.

811
01:02:10,084 --> 01:02:12,910
- I don't want to go.
- Of course you will.

812
01:02:15,297 --> 01:02:17,329
That woman is like a wall.

813
01:02:18,631 --> 01:02:19,595
She counts on you.

814
01:02:23,187 --> 01:02:27,261
My father had a garage. He was cheated.
His lawyer didn't give a damn.

815
01:02:28,155 --> 01:02:29,477
He lost everything.

816
01:02:30,104 --> 01:02:32,257
I don't know what to do.

817
01:02:32,847 --> 01:02:34,093
I rang your assistant.

818
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:38,256
You have testimonies and
the coroner report.

819
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:39,763
And Lassalle son.

820
01:02:40,192 --> 01:02:42,162
- Ah yes... Shit!
- Why?

821
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:44,146
We had an argument yesterday.

822
01:02:45,873 --> 01:02:47,294
Don't look at the spelling.

823
01:02:47,881 --> 01:02:50,243
Mine can be faulty too sometimes.

824
01:02:51,297 --> 01:02:52,349
Not in the same way.

825
01:02:54,457 --> 01:02:56,377
You were right.
Audrey is terrifying.

826
01:02:56,831 --> 01:02:59,353
She is a witch.
A modern one at that.

827
01:02:59,794 --> 01:03:04,493
Her sexuality is abysmal and
she believes in colored fluids.

828
01:03:06,089 --> 01:03:08,121
Worst part is that I want to see her.

829
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:11,329
Mr. Louis Lassalle?

830
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:15,859
When Dimitri Datchev was not
working for your mother,

831
01:03:17,036 --> 01:03:20,548
did you sometimes ask for his help?

832
01:03:21,024 --> 01:03:22,051
Sometimes.

833
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:26,078
Can you tell us what jobs he did for you?

834
01:03:26,655 --> 01:03:30,953
He would drive me at the doctor's,
at parties, at friends, everywhere.

835
01:03:31,895 --> 01:03:33,939
Did he go with you in bars,

836
01:03:34,502 --> 01:03:36,300
- discos?
- Never.

837
01:03:38,259 --> 01:03:40,768
It's no secret you go out
a lot at night, is it?

838
01:03:41,712 --> 01:03:43,155
I even meet you sometimes.

839
01:03:44,184 --> 01:03:46,974
Tell me, Mr. Lassalle,
you never married?

840
01:03:47,661 --> 01:03:48,553
Never.

841
01:03:49,596 --> 01:03:50,783
Did you think of it?

842
01:03:51,408 --> 01:03:52,693
It didn't happen.

843
01:03:54,885 --> 01:03:57,784
You never met the right woman?

844
01:03:58,595 --> 01:04:02,756
Or would you say your desires
led you onto other paths?

845
01:04:04,702 --> 01:04:06,795
I see no reason to answer.

846
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:13,316
Let go of me!

847
01:04:13,878 --> 01:04:14,894
Quiet, please!

848
01:04:17,136 --> 01:04:18,887
What's with you? I thought you were zen.

849
01:04:19,012 --> 01:04:22,743
You know how how much concentration is
needed in a trial? You don't give a damn.

850
01:04:22,868 --> 01:04:24,578
What right have you to say so?

851
01:04:24,703 --> 01:04:27,548
You come in... out. You cause bloody chaos.
You think his work is easy?

852
01:04:27,914 --> 01:04:29,236
What do you know about law?

853
01:04:30,044 --> 01:04:33,655
I'll say it calmly... don't come close
to him. He won't see you any more.

854
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,115
Who says so? You or he?

855
01:04:36,345 --> 01:04:38,463
- You go to bed with him?
- I know how he feels.

856
01:04:38,976 --> 01:04:40,888
He doesn't give a damn about you.

857
01:04:41,914 --> 01:04:44,887
When he's gone, you won't exist,
you'll go back watching your parkings!

858
01:04:45,013 --> 01:04:46,333
Don't come near him.

859
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:48,932
It can't be true...

860
01:04:49,617 --> 01:04:50,792
You're in love?

861
01:04:52,028 --> 01:04:53,215
Shove off!

862
01:04:54,195 --> 01:04:55,125
I won't.

863
01:04:55,946 --> 01:04:56,984
Shove off!

864
01:05:06,362 --> 01:05:09,299
Dimitri Datchev
was hired by your mother.

865
01:05:12,035 --> 01:05:16,172
In that intimacy,
in that daily threesome,

866
01:05:16,298 --> 01:05:18,524
you started having contradictory

867
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:22,553
feelings towards him.

868
01:05:24,693 --> 01:05:27,828
You are a clever man.
You were aware of that.

869
01:05:28,481 --> 01:05:33,253
As the days went by, slowly, you realized
the situation was getting dangerous.

870
01:05:33,731 --> 01:05:36,682
He was your mother's lover.
You were on forbidden grounds.

871
01:05:37,357 --> 01:05:42,202
That growing desire finally got
the better of you. You could not help it.

872
01:05:44,089 --> 01:05:45,629
You did not resist.

873
01:05:49,021 --> 01:05:50,111
Mr. Lassalle...

874
01:05:55,886 --> 01:05:57,844
Were you Dimitri Datchev's lover?

875
01:06:00,927 --> 01:06:01,968
Yes.

876
01:06:02,604 --> 01:06:03,950
When did your mother know?

877
01:06:05,114 --> 01:06:06,215
The day before.

878
01:06:07,329 --> 01:06:09,078
Under what circumstances?

879
01:06:09,484 --> 01:06:12,446
I told her. I couldn't bear
the idea of his going with her.

880
01:06:13,229 --> 01:06:15,125
I told her I would leave with Dimitri.

881
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,089
How did she react?

882
01:06:19,486 --> 01:06:20,955
She listened, said nothing.

883
01:06:22,192 --> 01:06:23,953
She went up to her room.

884
01:06:26,892 --> 01:06:28,421
I didn't see her again before...

885
01:06:38,167 --> 01:06:42,658
Hello, my love. This is version 1
of my movie. Don't be too harsh.

886
01:06:43,222 --> 01:06:46,209
You're my first spectator.
Your opinion means a lot.

887
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:47,241
Kisses.

888
01:06:47,585 --> 01:06:50,547
"In Bertrand Beauvois's gown"

889
01:06:51,183 --> 01:06:54,451
<i>Bertrand Beauvois is a lawyer,
dreaded in every Court.</i>

890
01:06:55,298 --> 01:06:58,116
<i>Repeat rapers or ruthless thugs,</i>

891
01:06:58,372 --> 01:07:00,695
<i>he defends the worst criminals.</i>

892
01:07:02,988 --> 01:07:06,709
<i>He found a second home in Monaco.
And it has changed him.</i>

893
01:07:06,979 --> 01:07:08,887
<i>He is simple, forthright</i>

894
01:07:09,345 --> 01:07:11,988
<i>available, everyone can speak to him.</i>

895
01:07:12,698 --> 01:07:15,463
<i>The mildness, the fresh air</i>

896
01:07:15,928 --> 01:07:17,986
<i>the easy living in our principality</i>

897
01:07:18,218 --> 01:07:19,735
<i>won his heart.</i>

898
01:07:20,344 --> 01:07:22,229
<i>Counselor Beauvois loves our city,</i>

899
01:07:22,586 --> 01:07:25,816
<i>its history, with its pump
and its tragedies.</i>

900
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:29,622
<i>In spite of the importance
of his work,</i>

901
01:07:29,746 --> 01:07:32,751
<i>Bertrand Beauvois knows how to party.</i>

902
01:07:32,993 --> 01:07:34,389
<i>He has friends of all ages...</i>

903
01:07:36,738 --> 01:07:38,550
When do they show that masterpiece?

904
01:07:39,169 --> 01:07:40,234
It's pathetic.

905
01:07:42,878 --> 01:07:45,937
I'll ring her.
I'll ring her at once.

906
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:50,029
Who else can do it?

907
01:07:52,011 --> 01:07:53,088
No one.

908
01:07:57,913 --> 01:08:00,141
My parents have closed for us.
It's nice, isn't it?

909
01:08:01,047 --> 01:08:03,177
They thought you'd want some quiet.
Tomorrow is D day.

910
01:08:03,837 --> 01:08:06,016
It's nice, but you shouldn't have.

911
01:08:09,715 --> 01:08:11,796
- It's from de 'eart
- Thank you.

912
01:08:12,224 --> 01:08:13,644
Come, let's sit, sweetheart!

913
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,468
We'll leave you.

914
01:08:22,272 --> 01:08:23,923
Audrey... Listen...

915
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:26,285
Listen... I watched the film.

916
01:08:26,628 --> 01:08:28,158
Ah... you found the time?

917
01:08:28,434 --> 01:08:29,743
Cool... You liked it?

918
01:08:30,404 --> 01:08:32,117
Hubert wants to show it on Sunday.

919
01:08:32,351 --> 01:08:33,782
It... No way.

920
01:08:34,946 --> 01:08:36,169
You're handsome tonight.

921
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:39,793
Why do you tell me those things?

922
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:46,461
What's going on?
Your hands are sweaty.

923
01:08:47,452 --> 01:08:49,570
- They're not!
- You're sweating! Loook!

924
01:08:49,695 --> 01:08:50,806
No, I'm fine.

925
01:08:59,866 --> 01:09:01,531
- Audrey...
- Drink your champagne!

926
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:08,396
- What do you think of it?
- Awful!

927
01:09:09,496 --> 01:09:12,386
Last bottle left from our parents'
wedding. We opened it for you.

928
01:09:13,604 --> 01:09:14,912
To us!

929
01:09:21,104 --> 01:09:23,381
- Audrey...
- I've thought things over, Bertrand!

930
01:09:24,729 --> 01:09:26,712
We can't go on like this.
It goes nowhere.

931
01:09:27,655 --> 01:09:29,196
It's true. You're right.

932
01:09:29,453 --> 01:09:31,411
We're going nowhere.
Don't you think?

933
01:09:31,855 --> 01:09:33,213
Yes... yes.

934
01:09:34,058 --> 01:09:35,368
We feel the same. Good!

935
01:09:36,642 --> 01:09:38,135
It's a nice encounter.

936
01:09:38,452 --> 01:09:40,485
In 2 days, you'll go back.
I can't stand it.

937
01:09:40,854 --> 01:09:43,400
Life goes on.
What else can we do?

938
01:09:44,014 --> 01:09:44,942
It's possible.

939
01:09:46,313 --> 01:09:47,379
I can go with you.

940
01:09:48,369 --> 01:09:50,365
I can leave everything here.
No problem!

941
01:09:50,712 --> 01:09:52,965
Family, buddies, weather report.
I don't care!

942
01:09:53,259 --> 01:09:54,753
What I want is to be with you.

943
01:09:57,532 --> 01:10:00,149
Taste this at once.
It mustn't wait.

944
01:10:08,091 --> 01:10:10,013
It's very good.
Oregano, isn't it?

945
01:10:16,284 --> 01:10:18,009
I haven't washed my hands for 8 days.

946
01:10:19,343 --> 01:10:20,348
Want to know why?

947
01:10:20,922 --> 01:10:21,928
To keep your smell.

948
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:26,750
I'd never have thought
I could be with someone like you.

949
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:30,251
Know what Diana said?

950
01:10:31,121 --> 01:10:33,398
That lack of love is
the worst disease in the world.

951
01:10:34,113 --> 01:10:35,900
Even in the end when she left Charles,

952
01:10:36,585 --> 01:10:38,544
all she cared for was
the nobility of the heart.

953
01:10:39,852 --> 01:10:41,187
Though she'd lost everything,

954
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:43,721
her money, her way of life.

955
01:10:44,243 --> 01:10:45,283
Even her dogs.

956
01:10:45,835 --> 01:10:46,765
Please...

957
01:10:48,601 --> 01:10:50,670
You can't imagine being
with a girl like me...

958
01:10:51,759 --> 01:10:52,591
Can you?

959
01:10:54,716 --> 01:10:56,896
I wouldn't blame you.
I know where I come from.

960
01:11:00,828 --> 01:11:02,418
But don't tell me now.

961
01:11:07,818 --> 01:11:08,872
I think I love you.

962
01:11:16,634 --> 01:11:17,785
I won't go.

963
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:22,601
Ring Alain.
He'll replace me.

964
01:11:23,005 --> 01:11:24,009
You can't do that.

965
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:26,249
I can't plead.

966
01:11:26,725 --> 01:11:28,269
But you're going to win.

967
01:11:28,513 --> 01:11:30,276
I'm exhausted. I... I...

968
01:11:30,622 --> 01:11:32,691
I can't fight.
I'm going into pieces.

969
01:11:34,013 --> 01:11:36,924
- I can stop her getting into the Court room.
- That's not the problem.

970
01:11:37,488 --> 01:11:39,508
She wants to come and live
in Paris with me.

971
01:11:40,025 --> 01:11:43,795
She's planning her moving away,
her first baby's birth.

972
01:11:45,484 --> 01:11:46,709
Do you love her?

973
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,386
I don't know. She's there,

974
01:11:51,511 --> 01:11:53,368
she invades me, she is my obsession.

975
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:56,478
Damn, it's hell.
You can't go on like this.

976
01:11:57,084 --> 01:12:00,450
You won't let that girl destroy you.
You need to have balls.

977
01:12:01,124 --> 01:12:03,375
Balls! Always balls!

978
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:05,736
I won't always be there to help.

979
01:12:06,129 --> 01:12:08,418
Without you, I wouldn't be
in such a mess.

980
01:12:08,817 --> 01:12:09,722
Without me?

981
01:12:09,847 --> 01:12:13,029
You told me she was a sexual prodigy,
that she was a bomb.

982
01:12:13,615 --> 01:12:15,841
That I had to be simple.
All the bullshit!

983
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:19,012
You're tired.

984
01:12:21,865 --> 01:12:23,396
You were supposed to protect me.

985
01:12:25,182 --> 01:12:26,370
See how you did it.

986
01:12:27,998 --> 01:12:29,197
Are you proud?

987
01:12:30,864 --> 01:12:32,344
What do you propose?

988
01:12:35,147 --> 01:12:36,188
Find some idea.

989
01:12:45,935 --> 01:12:48,320
Oh, My God!
Do something.

990
01:12:49,202 --> 01:12:51,234
I don't want to see her any more!

991
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,913
Hello, my sweet.

992
01:13:02,107 --> 01:13:03,147
Let's make peace.

993
01:13:09,296 --> 01:13:11,756
You should have worn your blue shirt.
It "flashed" more with your eyes.

994
01:13:13,456 --> 01:13:15,233
A fresh pineaple juice, please!

995
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:18,432
With croissant and toast
with honey and marmalade.

996
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:19,913
Thanks.

997
01:13:21,823 --> 01:13:23,819
Stop drinking coffee!
It will stress you!

998
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:25,337
It's decaff.

999
01:13:26,025 --> 01:13:29,169
Don't worry. It will work.
I'll send you positive waves.

1000
01:13:39,195 --> 01:13:42,611
Shit! My movie camera!
I forgot it in my scooter at Bouli's.

1001
01:13:42,933 --> 01:13:44,681
Hell! I won't have you pleading.

1002
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:46,775
You can't shoot in the Court Room.

1003
01:13:47,705 --> 01:13:49,798
- Go! I'll come later.
- I can take her.

1004
01:13:51,332 --> 01:13:52,139
True?

1005
01:13:53,215 --> 01:13:55,101
Yes, I can go on my own.

1006
01:13:56,129 --> 01:13:57,622
Keep the car. Mine is close.

1007
01:13:58,752 --> 01:13:59,964
We'll see you later.

1008
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:04,126
- Take your time.
- See you, sweetheart.

1009
01:14:16,398 --> 01:14:19,861
It's starting to rain. I had told so
in my bulletin. I was right.

1010
01:14:21,403 --> 01:14:23,509
What's wrong? You quarrelled?

1011
01:14:24,745 --> 01:14:25,774
No.

1012
01:14:27,135 --> 01:14:28,175
Not because of me?

1013
01:14:30,184 --> 01:14:31,345
May I put some music on?

1014
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:38,055
I love that song.
It brings back good memories.

1015
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:40,345
- Not to you?
- No, not to me.

1016
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,138
- You're a sexy driver.
- Stop it!

1017
01:14:49,713 --> 01:14:51,120
Come on! You want it too!

1018
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:55,356
Remember your fit in front of my door?
You woke up the whole building.

1019
01:14:57,445 --> 01:14:58,462
What a laugh!

1020
01:15:01,912 --> 01:15:02,829
So funny!

1021
01:15:28,779 --> 01:15:30,223
Why are we stopping here?

1022
01:15:34,275 --> 01:15:35,315
What's that look?

1023
01:15:38,717 --> 01:15:39,709
What do you want?

1024
01:15:43,723 --> 01:15:45,156
Say it...

1025
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,478
We can talk too.

1026
01:15:50,815 --> 01:15:52,332
That's not what you really want.

1027
01:15:56,774 --> 01:15:57,669
Listen!

1028
01:15:58,247 --> 01:16:01,111
I know it's silly.
We'll be sorry afterwards.

1029
01:16:02,567 --> 01:16:04,574
Say one word and I'll stop.

1030
01:16:13,276 --> 01:16:14,281
Shall I stop?

1031
01:17:11,478 --> 01:17:12,996
My scooter! Shit!

1032
01:17:14,146 --> 01:17:16,399
Damaged!
Are you going to help me?

1033
01:17:20,929 --> 01:17:22,877
What are you waiting for?

1034
01:17:26,622 --> 01:17:27,589
Hurry!

1035
01:17:35,795 --> 01:17:37,104
I'm fine. Don't worry!

1036
01:17:37,448 --> 01:17:39,602
We never did anything, right?
Forget it!

1037
01:17:40,691 --> 01:17:41,806
Let's hurry!

1038
01:17:43,274 --> 01:17:44,706
What about lunch in San Remo?

1039
01:17:45,513 --> 01:17:47,693
Are you crazy?
You want to have lunch!

1040
01:17:48,013 --> 01:17:49,690
- Bertrand must be waiting for me.
- He is not!

1041
01:17:50,731 --> 01:17:52,640
- He never will.
- What are you saying?

1042
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:54,917
It's over.

1043
01:17:56,508 --> 01:17:57,781
You thought it was serious?

1044
01:18:01,522 --> 01:18:03,701
You don't get it, do you?
We'll get married.

1045
01:18:03,934 --> 01:18:06,200
We'll live together in Paris.
I'll meet his friends.

1046
01:18:06,873 --> 01:18:08,415
I won't let that chance pass by.

1047
01:18:08,738 --> 01:18:12,104
You want to spend your life as a guard
at the casino, that's your problem.

1048
01:18:13,901 --> 01:18:15,885
I'm not ashamed. Yes I will succeed.

1049
01:18:16,178 --> 01:18:18,748
I didn't work my ass off for nothing.
I will be a star.

1050
01:18:19,844 --> 01:18:20,896
What sort of star?

1051
01:18:21,436 --> 01:18:24,312
Poor guy!
I really feel sorry for you at times!

1052
01:18:24,544 --> 01:18:27,542
Tomorrow I'll take the plane with him.
For you, it's over!

1053
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:29,538
Contract ended!

1054
01:18:33,577 --> 01:18:34,998
If you could see your face!

1055
01:20:57,951 --> 01:20:59,665
<i>Since that trial started,</i>

1056
01:21:00,497 --> 01:21:03,849
<i>Mrs Lassalle has betrayed no feeling</i>

1057
01:21:04,427 --> 01:21:07,476
<i>she seems very far from here</i>

1058
01:21:09,018 --> 01:21:14,574
It looks like she did everything to
prevent us to understand her secrets.

1059
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:19,652
That mask impressed us all a lot.

1060
01:21:19,957 --> 01:21:22,784
She chose to entrench inside herself.

1061
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:26,938
<i>Yet should we conclude from her attitude
that she feels neither pain</i>

1062
01:21:28,077 --> 01:21:29,007
<i>nor remorse.</i>

1063
01:21:30,186 --> 01:21:32,181
<i>nor hope of forgiveness.</i>

1064
01:21:34,404 --> 01:21:38,368
<i>What does not express itself teaches
us about ourselves and about life...</i>

1065
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:08,006
I assure you it puzzles me...

1066
01:22:08,339 --> 01:22:11,730
I looked at the jury, especially
the women. They were deeply moved.

1067
01:22:13,382 --> 01:22:14,875
Congratulations, Counselor.

1068
01:22:19,715 --> 01:22:21,379
It was great. Congratulations!

1069
01:22:36,599 --> 01:22:38,043
Can I have a cigarette?

1070
01:22:41,474 --> 01:22:43,263
You're the last Gitanes smoker.

1071
01:22:45,086 --> 01:22:46,260
I do as my father did.

1072
01:22:51,783 --> 01:22:53,387
What did you think of my pleading?

1073
01:22:54,794 --> 01:22:55,713
Wonderful!

1074
01:22:57,267 --> 01:22:58,298
Thank you.

1075
01:22:58,959 --> 01:23:02,594
Her not being there helped me a lot.

1076
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:08,201
Would you mind if I didn't wait with you?

1077
01:23:09,868 --> 01:23:12,156
No. Something wrong?

1078
01:23:12,735 --> 01:23:13,665
I'm fine.

1079
01:23:15,009 --> 01:23:16,258
You look tired.

1080
01:23:16,687 --> 01:23:18,045
You should take a holiday.

1081
01:23:21,325 --> 01:23:22,845
But... where is she?

1082
01:23:24,402 --> 01:23:25,943
She won't bother you any more.

1083
01:23:27,767 --> 01:23:28,807
<i>Are you coming, Counselor?</i>

1084
01:23:31,305 --> 01:23:33,019
<i>My daughter says she'll get the minimum.</i>

1085
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:49,099
Here you are, Sir!

1086
01:23:53,774 --> 01:23:56,368
- Was your stay here nice?
- Perfect!

1087
01:23:56,849 --> 01:23:58,917
- Did someone ask for me?
- No, Sir.

1088
01:24:00,191 --> 01:24:02,198
What time shall I ask the taxi to come?

1089
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:03,485
I'll tell you.

1090
01:24:28,315 --> 01:24:30,642
<i>Counselor? Inspector Torrent.</i>

1091
01:24:31,094 --> 01:24:32,905
Can I talk to you?

1092
01:24:37,189 --> 01:24:38,682
How did it happen?

1093
01:24:40,289 --> 01:24:42,993
Well... that's why I asked you
to come with me.

1094
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:46,837
It is not a traffic accident.

1095
01:24:49,936 --> 01:24:51,061
What do you mean?

1096
01:24:53,583 --> 01:24:56,950
Miss Varela's scooter was hit
by another vehicle.

1097
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:01,481
We have every reason to think that
your protection agent, Mr. Abadi

1098
01:25:01,996 --> 01:25:03,391
is responsible for that collision.

1099
01:25:04,283 --> 01:25:05,654
We are questioning him.

1100
01:25:07,995 --> 01:25:10,885
But he refuses to answer.

1101
01:25:40,289 --> 01:25:43,312
There's paint on the victim's scooter.

1102
01:25:45,136 --> 01:25:48,832
It matches with that of the rented Volvo
Mr. Abadi drove every day.

1103
01:25:50,314 --> 01:25:53,915
We are sure there was a collision
involving the two vehicles.

1104
01:26:20,488 --> 01:26:22,448
Excuse me... Can I get a drink of water?

1105
01:26:23,069 --> 01:26:23,962
Of course!

1106
01:26:28,518 --> 01:26:30,293
<i>We've got to determine what happened.</i>

1107
01:26:30,895 --> 01:26:34,606
You understand how important
your testimony is.

1108
01:26:36,185 --> 01:26:40,748
We don't know yet if it was a crime
or a hit and run traffic accident.

1109
01:27:13,326 --> 01:27:14,062
<i>Sir?</i>

1110
01:27:21,514 --> 01:27:24,599
Mr Abadi has nothing to do
with Miss Varela's death.

1111
01:27:26,352 --> 01:27:29,020
I've kept the car the whole morning.

1112
01:27:30,489 --> 01:27:31,773
I was driving.

1113
01:27:34,419 --> 01:27:36,461
No one is responsible but me.

1114
01:27:42,915 --> 01:27:45,057
Mr. Abadi, you can go home.

1115
01:27:47,496 --> 01:27:49,196
Don't worry, Christophe.

1116
01:27:50,482 --> 01:27:52,378
I secured the area.

1117
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:08,909
One year later...

1118
01:28:29,052 --> 01:28:30,608
<i>One,
two</i>

1119
01:28:31,255 --> 01:28:32,100
<i>three,</i>

1120
01:28:32,225 --> 01:28:33,777
<i>four,
five.</i>

1121
01:28:38,691 --> 01:28:39,610
<i>One,</i>

1122
01:28:39,842 --> 01:28:40,736
<i>two,</i>

1123
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:41,714
<i>three,</i>

1124
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,305
<i>four, and five.</i>

1125
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:45,374
<i>and six. Turn round.
One...</i>

1126
01:28:45,795 --> 01:28:46,749
<i>two, faster!</i>

1127
01:28:46,875 --> 01:28:48,279
<i>three and four,</i>

1128
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:49,981
<i>and five, and six.</i>

1129
01:28:50,108 --> 01:28:52,697
<i>And one, and two,
and three,</i>

1130
01:28:53,055 --> 01:28:55,293
<i>and four, and five...
Move your feet... and one...</i>

1131
01:28:55,647 --> 01:28:58,047
<i>and two, and three,
and four,</i>

1132
01:28:58,407 --> 01:28:59,288
<i>and five...</i>

1133
01:29:32,081 --> 01:29:33,170
Thank you.

1134
01:29:55,205 --> 01:29:56,661
Beauvois... mail!

1135
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:02,680
Thank you!

1136
01:30:12,882 --> 01:30:13,875
<i>Dear Sir,</i>

1137
01:30:15,111 --> 01:30:17,192
<i>I'm still here,
I won't be coming back soon.</i>

1138
01:30:18,576 --> 01:30:22,564
<i>I met some guy with whom
I'll work in a scuba diving center.</i>

1139
01:30:24,673 --> 01:30:26,730
<i>At minus 20 meters,
you don't think at all.</i>

1140
01:30:28,651 --> 01:30:30,219
<i>It is difficult to forget.</i>

1141
01:30:32,829 --> 01:30:34,810
<i>If you changed your mind,</i>

1142
01:30:35,056 --> 01:30:37,614
<i>I could come back at once.</i>

1143
01:30:40,206 --> 01:30:42,457
<i>Yours truly,
Abadi Christophe.</i>

1144
01:30:52,216 --> 01:30:54,641
<i>Tomorrow will be a sunny day,</i>

1145
01:30:55,619 --> 01:30:57,712
<i>20 to 22 degrees Celsius
in the afternoon</i>

1146
01:31:00,913 --> 01:31:03,457
<i>A solar wind will blow slowly
over the bay.</i>

1147
01:31:05,698 --> 01:31:06,775
<i>A clousless sky.</i>

1148
01:31:09,051 --> 01:31:10,300
<i>Summer is starting.</i>

1149
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:31,353
<i>On the deserted beach,</i>

1150
01:31:33,414 --> 01:31:35,458
<i>all the shellfish</i>

1151
01:31:37,466 --> 01:31:40,343
<i>who would have thought so,
mourn the loss of summer,</i>

1152
01:31:41,853 --> 01:31:43,665
<i>which now has gone away...</i>

1153
01:31:45,831 --> 01:31:48,757
<i>We've put away the holidays,</i>

1154
01:31:49,515 --> 01:31:52,416
<i>in cardboard suitcases</i>

1155
01:31:54,212 --> 01:31:57,064
<i>and it's sad when you think of the season</i>

1156
01:31:57,896 --> 01:32:00,418
<i>of sun and songs.</i>

1157
01:32:02,123 --> 01:32:05,537
<i>Yet I know, next year,</i>

1158
01:32:06,296 --> 01:32:09,111
<i>All will bloom again,
we'll come back,</i>

1159
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:14,034
<i>but in the meantime I feel sorry</i>

1160
01:32:14,793 --> 01:32:17,816
<i>to leave the sea and my house.</i>

1161
01:32:19,273 --> 01:32:22,088
<i>The north wind will get used</i>

1162
01:32:23,544 --> 01:32:26,372
<i>to run without the sail boats,</i>

1163
01:32:28,245 --> 01:32:31,109
<i>but it is in my uncombed hair</i>

1164
01:32:32,483 --> 01:32:34,906
<i>That I will miss it the most.</i>

1165
01:32:36,314 --> 01:32:39,361
<i>The sun, my good friend,</i>

1166
01:32:40,517 --> 01:32:43,308
<i>will only burn me from afar,</i>

1167
01:32:45,302 --> 01:32:48,450
<i>thinking that we're sore at each other</i>

1168
01:32:49,485 --> 01:32:51,663
<i>to be apart</i>

1169
01:32:53,192 --> 01:32:56,326
<i>The train will take me towards autumn,</i>

1170
01:32:57,513 --> 01:33:00,598
<i>back to the city in the rain</i>

1171
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:05,302
<i>My pain will be for no one.</i>

1172
01:33:06,184 --> 01:33:09,023
<i>I'll keep as a friend.</i>

1173
01:33:10,667 --> 01:33:13,262
<i>But in the first days of summer,</i>

1174
01:33:14,976 --> 01:33:17,730
<i>forgetting all my troubles,</i>

1175
01:33:19,237 --> 01:33:22,604
<i>we'll come back and party with shellfish,</i>

1176
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:26,338
<i>on the sunny beach.</i>
