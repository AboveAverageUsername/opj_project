{2839}{2937}It's great... really quite great.
{2965}{3017}Still... if it goes further|- and I'd really love to-
{3020}{3098}We run the risk of getting into|a strong relationship.
{3112}{3155}Who knows how far it would take us?
{3168}{3227}Are we ready for such a shock?
{3249}{3340}- We don't have to be serious about it.|- But it is. Very serious.
{3362}{3407}The first kiss is something huge.
{3419}{3497}To me, what we've just lived|is already a story
{3519}{3561}Don't pretend you're afraid of me!
{3579}{3649}It has nothing to do with fear.|Quite the contrary.
{3661}{3718}Making that moment last|gives me incredible pleasure.
{3731}{3769}It gives it its chance.
{3792}{3816}Sorry...
{3826}{3872}Why should we get further with it?
{3885}{3915}It's marvellous...
{3923}{3990}We've known each other for 2 hours|and time has already stopped.
{4009}{4083}And what will happen next?
{4128}{4185}Let's say I ask you to my room|for a drink.
{4212}{4237}Let's say so.
{4249}{4308}Our coming together would|look quite ordinary.
{4326}{4375}A good surprise is always possible...
{4384}{4483}but things would probably turn|into something quite conformist.
{4561}{4601}Look! Some guy is following us.
{4642}{4692}He's been standing there|since we left the bar.
{4701}{4764}- He is a tourist!|- Doesn't look like it.
{4793}{4822}What does he want?
{4853}{4902}- Go ask him!|- You think so?
{5029}{5060}- Yes?|- There's something...
{5063}{5111}Chritophe Abadi. I'm your bodyguard.
{5130}{5171}- My bodyguard?|- Yes.
{5199}{5239}- Mr. Lassalle didn't tell you?|- No.
{5259}{5347}- Sorry, I should have told you.|- I didn't ask to be protected.
{5359}{5407}Are you in danger?|What have you done?
{5410}{5470}- No, it's nonsensical.|- Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb.
{5489}{5548}There must be some misunderstanding.|I'll phone Mr Lassalle.
{5559}{5598}Lassalle? The Lassalle case?
{5607}{5705}You're defending her? I heard that|he fired all her lawyers.
{5712}{5776}Give me a few seconds.|I'll take care of this.
{5779}{5803}No, listen...
{5818}{5903}You have interesting theories but|time has not stopped that much.
{5923}{5980}- You won't abandon me here?|- I will.
{5997}{6028}Good luck for the trial.
{6372}{6430}- Excuse me but where are you going?|- To my hotel.
{6433}{6457}That way!
{6474}{6496}I know!
{7333}{7364}- Good evening!|- Good evening!
{7374}{7412}May I?... Excuse me.
{7557}{7602}What are you doing?
{7625}{7653}Securing the area.
{7716}{7759}The usual routine.
{8137}{8215}Excuse me but without interfering|with your professional ethics
{8218}{8290}I'm tired and I'll free you now.
{8293}{8382}I'd like you to let me know of|your agenda for the day every morning,
{8393}{8447}where you go and the names|of the people you are to see.
{8486}{8539}- Christophe... That's your name, right?|- Yes.
{8542}{8653}You can secure all the areas you want|but I have nothing to let you know of.
{8661}{8705}I don't need a body guard.
{8727}{8780}I'll phone Mr. Lassalle tomorrow.
{8789}{8830}In case of trouble, you ring me.
{8842}{8871}I'm in the next room.
{8921}{8948}Now... wait...
{8986}{9017}You're in the next room?
{9033}{9064}That's on my schedule.
{9081}{9106}Want to check?
{9114}{9144}No... no.
{9188}{9238}I'm here to help you, Mrs. Lassalle.
{9246}{9288}I won't win the case without you.
{9323}{9375}I can defend myself on my own.
{9390}{9431}I've told my son so.
{9436}{9545}Right... Can you tell me|how you intend to defend yourself.
{9555}{9576}I don't.
{9649}{9737}mrs Lassalloe...|Let's get acquainted first.
{9746}{9850}We won't go into details. I just need|to know what you feel about the events.
{9905}{9931}Have you got a cigarette?
{9952}{9996}No, but I can go get one.
{10003}{10025}Thank you.
{10039}{10079}Your son doesn't bring you cigarettes?
{10106}{10135}He doesn't come often.
{10533}{10583}- Have you got a cigarette?|- I only have black tobacco.
{10589}{10613}That will do.
{10727}{10749}Thank you very much.
{10793}{10891}The doctor who examined you said|your face was bruised.
{10923}{11000}Dimitri Datchev attacked you|before you knifed him.
{11013}{11035}Didn't he?
{11041}{11113}No, I struck first.
{11460}{11481}So?
{11487}{11529}Look, Mr. Lassalle, I'll tell you the truth,
{11551}{11574}it won't be easy.
{11577}{11645}Yeah... I'd told you.|My mother can be quite difficult.
{11648}{11708}- She told me she didn't see you much.|- She refuses to see me.
{11721}{11767}She must save her. Against herself.
{11778}{11832}The case is complicated.|I can't work miracles.
{11849}{11895}Yet... your... reputation.
{11917}{11965}Let's go in the car.
{12196}{12235}Outside we were at risk.
{12258}{12300}You were not threatened, were you?
{12304}{12334}I was. Anonymous letters.
{12343}{12394}Because of that,|Roberto does not leave me.
{12401}{12429}You have one too?
{12442}{12508}I meant to tell you...|I don't need any one.
{12519}{12565}Listen... you must feel safe.
{12588}{12650}Dimitri Datchev's brothers arrived|in Monaco yesterday.
{12656}{12704}You know as well as I that|Russians are dangerous.
{12903}{12957}You don't have to follow me|in here, do you?
{12971}{13021}I must be no farther than 6 yards.
{13038}{13075}Six yards? Why six?
{13086}{13111}That's the rule.
{13492}{13525}Won't you have dinner?
{13700}{13767}Having someone behind you|all the time is unpleasant.
{13775}{13800}I understand.
{13877}{13951}Please, come and sit here.|It will be better that way.
{14384}{14446}- Won't you order something?|- I've got a sandwich.
{14484}{14534}- And where is your sandwich?|- In my room.
{14561}{14621}- When will you eat it?|- When you're sleeping.
{14645}{14679}Pretend I'm not here.
{14710}{14740}Not easy.
{14751}{14795}The first quality of a S. O.|is to remain unnoticed.
{14813}{14842}S. O.?
{14850}{14883}Security Officer.
{15051}{15112}- What are you looking at?|- I'm working.
{15152}{15188}Slavs sighted?
{15202}{15268}Slavs or not, if you see anything|suspect, tell me about it.
{15355}{15399}I'd like to see the expert's report.
{15410}{15462}{Y:i}It was number 113, right?
{15465}{15487}{Y:i}Yes.
{15496}{15520}Here it is.
{15544}{15570}Wait!
{15579}{15621}I also found this.
{15652}{15724}- What is it?|- An Italian porn magazine.
{15734}{15769}Nice of you. But not for me.
{15784}{15851}Dimitri Datchev...|was elected stud of the month.
{15916}{15949}It's quite impressive.
{15962}{16055}You think those giant balls will help|us build a defense case?
{16128}{16163}May I have a coffee?
{16176}{16215}I'm working for Mr. Beauvois.
{16611}{16640}Bertrand!
{16884}{16958}- What are you doing here?|- In Paris, they told me you were here.
{16964}{17012}I couldn't wait.|I had to see you.
{17032}{17060}I've left that dumb ass.
{17142}{17166}You did?
{17202}{17241}What's your room number?
{17259}{17320}Could you take|my luggage to the room, please?
{17400}{17443}I threw my phone up into his face.
{17482}{17513}Tore up his retina...
{17519}{17549}{Y:i}You didn't!|- I did!
{17574}{17611}How is he feeling now?
{17630}{17657}Reserved prognosis.
{17676}{17707}What are you swallowing?
{17717}{17764}Xanax. But I don't want|to kill myself now.
{17767}{17821}- That's good news.|- I owe it to you.
{17855}{17901}What you told me last|time is wonderful.
{17904}{17981}- What did I tell you?|- About waiting, loveplay...
{17991}{18048}- Few men can say those things.|- Many do, many.
{18051}{18080}- No, no...|- Yes, yes...
{18083}{18157}All with their stupid machismo.|And after, nothing.
{18172}{18223}- Uncompromising, aren't you?|- Is it wrong?
{18226}{18289}No, that's not it...|Only... HÈlËne, be nice...
{18297}{18373}I'd like to talk about your husband.|What's the prognosis?
{18423}{18466}You're plumper than I thought.
{18469}{18507}It deteriorated quite suddenly.
{18510}{18580}- You know what? - Yes...|- I want oysters, champagne...
{18583}{18636}I want plenty of champagne!
{18695}{18764}Mixing xanax and champagne is crazy!
{18866}{18891}You've got a problem?
{18923}{18949}Not at all.
{19203}{19236}What's the score?
{19243}{19264}Zero zero.
{19276}{19313}Is Piccione playing?
{19349}{19371}You pronounce it "Piccione"?
{19419}{19466}- What do you say?|- Piccion'
{19479}{19510}- Is he playing?|- Yes.
{19757}{19825}If that woman stays in my room,|there will be awful problems.
{19835}{19898}- Tell her to leave.|- You don't know her. She won't.
{19920}{19956}{Y:i}Bertrand, come quickly...
{19959}{20005}Can you hear? Can you hear?
{20018}{20043}Frightening!
{20085}{20165}Ten minutes from now, you knock|at my door and say I'm asked for.
{20186}{20212}I count on you.
{20407}{20442}{Y:i}Be nice, HÈlËne,
{20456}{20510}that case I'm working on|is very difficult
{20516}{20563}In Paris,|you came on to me all the same.
{20572}{20622}Yes but here... the stakes are high.
{20640}{20686}You are a clever woman...|You are indeed...
{20689}{20747}If you're clever,|you must understand...
{20750}{20796}Stop blabbering.
{20808}{20862}Listen to me please...|Please, listen!
{20875}{20972}How can I tell... I'm the victim|of an incapacitating pathology...
{20975}{21022}We don't care.|I'm here for you...
{21032}{21117}- There are phases. You get it? phases...|- What phases?
{21141}{21246}When I met you, I was going through|a period of intense exaltation
{21252}{21296}I was available but today...
{21305}{21364}Today I'm racked by doubt.
{21477}{21516}Please, listen, HÈlËne...
{21519}{21594}I fear we'll get into a situation that is|quite far from your expectations
{21603}{21676}which seem to be very high.
{21699}{21809}My cycles are very conflicting and not|compatible with erotic availibility.
{21827}{21855}With what?
{21916}{21974}- Erotic availibilty.|- Erotic?
{21995}{22075}- What are you talking about?|- It may not be the right word.
{22140}{22223}Without being indiscret|how did you and your friend part?
{22233}{22265}None of your business.
{22278}{22337}HÈlËne... I think|you can still make up with him.
{22350}{22428}He loves you. That's quite sure.|Men know how to forgive.
{22438}{22515}Get him on the phone.|Tell him you made a mistake.
{22524}{22566}I'll dial the number.
{22596}{22679}Which is it?|You must dial zero first.
{22731}{22783}You don't know how much you need him.
{23004}{23060}I know it's not part of the job but
{23070}{23134}you should take care of that woman.|- What do you mean?
{23147}{23209}- She's remarkable, you know.|- What do you want me to do?
{23217}{23281}She is not well. Prevent her|from doing something wrong,
{23284}{23362}tell her I'm really not a man|for her. Use your insight.
{23381}{23463}- Right. - You look reassuring|to women. I can feel it.
{23491}{23535}- I'm not sure.|- Yes, believe me. It's a gift.
{23538}{23620}Can't be explained. Quite unfair|actually. I trust you. Go!
{23623}{23678}Go! I'll wait for you|in your room.
{23742}{23766}I'll see what I can do.
{24511}{24619}Tomorrow morning, a depression coming|from the north will bring rain all day.
{24622}{24692}Heavy clouds will gather|above our principality.
{24739}{24819}In a few days, I promise,|a softer air will close in on you.
{24826}{24880}Summer will start showing its nose
{24886}{24942}and everything will be much better.
{25278}{25302}Coffee, sir?
{25324}{25349}Yes.
{25595}{25620}Thank you very much.
{25648}{25692}- She's still there?|- She's gone.
{25712}{25756}{Y:i}- Where did she go?|- To Paris.
{25800}{25844}If I may, I'll use my bathroom.
{25850}{25873}Please do.
{26113}{26142}It wasn't too difficult?
{26155}{26203}{Y:i}- No!|- What did you tell her?
{26221}{26253}We didn't speak much.
{26294}{26344}- Can you tell me how...|- Very good.
{26378}{26408}What was very good?
{26443}{26487}She only needed solace.
{26584}{26617}And how did you do that?
{26645}{26679}I did what was necessary.
{26732}{26781}{Y:i}- You went to bed with her?|- A little
{26816}{26855}That's not what I asked you to do.
{26878}{26917}Sorry if I misunderstood.
{26932}{26963}How did you manage?
{26987}{27012}It happened.
{27082}{27121}It is that simple for you...
{27144}{27196}- I shouldn't have?|- Yes, yes.
{27211}{27265}Yes. You were very professional.
{27355}{27418}For you, it's simple, I guess.|You see a girl,
{27434}{27503}you like her, you go to bed|with her. You find it natural.
{27537}{27562}It's the aim, isn't it?
{27580}{27651}Have you ever wondered|why we go to bed.
{27701}{27745}{Y:i}- No.|Well, you should.
{27756}{27796}We're told lots of stories.
{27809}{27882}That things will be wonderful.|Most of the time it's a disappointment.
{27920}{27954}Yet, it's life.
{27977}{28038}"On the deserted beach... "
{28088}{28148}"all the shellfish,... "
{28193}{28262}"who would have thought so,|wish summer were still here. "
{28293}{28328}"But it is over now. "
{28341}{28398}Thanks for your advice, Audrey.|See you tomorrow.
{28401}{28502}Defense lawyer Bertrand Beauvois is our|guest. We thank him for being here.
{28525}{28628}Can you tell us why you accepted|to defend Mrs. Lassalle?
{28672}{28763}I never know why I accept|a case but what I
{28766}{28856}can say is that nothing in Edith Lassalle's|life could let us foresee such tragedy.
{28919}{28944}{Y:i}Wait!
{28995}{29027}Hey, what are you doing here?
{29054}{29099}- I'm working.|- You two are together.
{29121}{29162}- Hello!|- Hello!
{29174}{29213}Your hair looks nice that way.
{29241}{29283}It's your first case in Monaco?
{29299}{29320}Yes!
{29323}{29353}Welcome on the rock!
{29660}{29704}Shellfish on the beach, not today!
{29715}{29798}Quiet! I'm not given the right cards.|I must invent. It's not a real science!
{29815}{29867}I saw you singing "la gadoue".|That was great!
{29878}{29951}Thanks! It's pleasant to hear this.|No one ever says anything.
{29973}{30007}Right! I'll be on my way!
{30081}{30123}We'll phone, right?|Goodbye, sir!
{30137}{30163}Bye!
{30185}{30210}She's fun!
{30235}{30281}She's a girl from here!|Typical!
{30285}{30321}Typical? Why?
{30340}{30371}{Y:i}That sort of girl is everywhere!
{30390}{30434}You seem to know each other well!
{30466}{30517}- You had something with her?|- Can say that!
{30802}{30826}Are you coming, Sir?
{31130}{31157}Thank you.
{31172}{31214}Do you mind if I stay in the courtroom?
{31217}{31251}- Not at all.|- Thank you.
{31259}{31312}{Y:i}I must remind you that|he was knifed 17 times.
{31348}{31420}{Y:i}Those photographs say much|more than any preferment.
{31439}{31483}According to the coroner,
{31493}{31556}the victim, though seriously wounded,
{31566}{31614}tried to escape his murderer.
{31629}{31773}{Y:i}Don't forget, Your Honors, what's|at stake here, in this Court,
{31782}{31845}{Y:i}A man, Dimitri Datchev, knifed to death,
{31856}{31966}{Y:i}a murderer who kept going at her victim|with extraordinary violence
{32043}{32095}{Y:i}...we detailed the autopsy report...
{32181}{32239}{Y:i}What we know is that,|after Italy,
{32242}{32342}Dimitri was hired as a waiter|at Hotel Mirabeau.
{32360}{32387}How long?
{32394}{32425}{Y:i}It doesn't say.
{32428}{32464}He didn't stay.
{32475}{32522}Afterwards he was washing|dishes at the "47".
{32525}{32554}What's the "47"?
{32560}{32586}A night-club.
{32596}{32624}{Y:i}You go there?
{32645}{32679}I worked there at security.
{32769}{32843}You see that space behind the column?|We call it the widows' corner.
{32856}{32923}It was Dimitri's hunting ground.|He met Edith Lassalle there.
{32934}{33021}It's appalling! Having to bear|that noise at 60!
{33099}{33136}You've seen that woman?
{33163}{33218}You noticed how strange|her hairdo is?
{33234}{33275}The anxiety you feel.
{33313}{33381}You feel how lonely she is.
{33401}{33443}She's not unhappy.|She's into her thing.
{33458}{33508}That's right. We always lay|too much about things.
{33576}{33606}- That Peugeot is yours?|- Yeah!
{33614}{33638}Can you move it?
{33657}{33691}I'm not sure I can leave...
{33694}{33746}- You trust me?|- Yes.
{33749}{33777}Well... Go!
{34325}{34350}Guess who!
{34362}{34416}I'm "la gadoue"|Remember?
{34470}{34499}I recognized your back.
{34507}{34557}What are you doing here?|Not chasing girls?
{34566}{34601}Why? I'm too old?
{34607}{34630}Almost.
{34652}{34708}- You always say what you think.|- I shouldn't?
{34733}{34776}Yes, yes. It's risky though.
{34800}{34834}- You're Aquarius, aren't you?|- Yes.
{34848}{34888}I must be wary of Aquarius.
{34902}{34935}Aren't you thirsty? I am...
{34981}{35005}Yes, I'm thirsty.
{35028}{35091}I'm with friends over there.|They'd like to meet you.
{35103}{35149}- Yeah?|- Guess who won the shoes'contest?
{35152}{35191}- Fabio!|- No, I did!
{35401}{35460}Let me! I'll take off your shirt.
{35467}{35513}- Why?|- I'll clean it in the sink.
{35516}{35578}- I'll give it at the hotel.|- Why? You're embarrassed?
{35581}{35632}You keep your socks on the beach?
{35635}{35721}- I rarely go to the beach.|- Cute! You've got goose pimples.
{35735}{35787}You've got a baby's skin.|You should share it!
{35825}{35861}What's going on here?
{35880}{35956}Could you find a shirt, Christophe?
{35986}{36009}A shirt?
{36139}{36215}Imagine what he thought...|seeing us there.
{36221}{36262}He thought nothing of it.
{36273}{36326}Why? You don't think it possible,|you and I?
{36384}{36439}No answer? Cat got your tongue?
{36449}{36492}Audrey? What are you doing?|Hurry!
{36502}{36546}Can you lend your shirt to my friend?
{36608}{36642}I shouldn't have left you.
{36665}{36722}- You see: I survived!|- What did she say to you?
{36729}{36805}Crazy things!|She's got her own language.
{36813}{36879}- You can say that indeed.|- You're harsh.
{36891}{36939}- Do you know how she got that job on tv?|- No.
{36956}{37037}She was in a disgusting reality show,|"The diva of love". Do you know it?
{37040}{37091}- No.|- You can't imagine what she did to win.
{37258}{37299}- You got a light?|- I don't smoke.
{37317}{37359}- I know you, don't I?|- I don't...
{37362}{37407}Please, Sir!|Sir!
{37501}{37540}Move on! Move on!
{37558}{37636}Why did you do that?|He is harmless.
{37651}{37701}- He was drunk!|- He was too close.
{37704}{37782}- I had to act.|- You're impressive when angry.
{37800}{37839}- You scared me!|- Not what I meant to do!
{37871}{37975}Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,|I must say that Mrs Lassalle
{37978}{38041}is not used to|going to that sort of place.
{38056}{38122}She lived away from the world|and did not see many people.
{38137}{38233}But she was probably not|satisfied by her life.
{38259}{38336}When she gets into the "47"|that evening,
{38345}{38408}she is vulnerable and very lonely.
{38434}{38498}Quickly, Mr. Datchev sees her.
{38510}{38623}He looks at her jewels.|An organized predator, he plans.
{38641}{38753}The first night, he won't talk about|money. He'll even pay for everything.
{38762}{38797}{Y:i}- He is a professional.|- Sir!
{38893}{38957}I forbid you to talk|that way about the events.
{38978}{39035}- I'll explain.|- There's nothing to explain.
{39041}{39106}- You'll stop and that'll be it.|- Let me.
{39346}{39371}Fine?
{39426}{39461}Started a long time ago?|- Yeah.
{39466}{39519}Counselor... Can you go on?
{39546}{39573}Yes, Your Honor.
{39585}{39638}The very reluctance Mrs Lassalle shows...
{39647}{39720}You read the papers?|Your boss is quite famous!
{39910}{39938}Ah, there you are!
{39963}{39994}Can I see him?|- You can't.
{39997}{40043}- Why?|- He mustn't be disturbed.
{40066}{40127}- Seems you like your job.|- It's o. k.
{40144}{40201}I've still got your blue pull over.
{40222}{40277}I'll give it back to you.|It's too nice for me anyway.
{40314}{40340}Good evening.
{40393}{40438}It was extraordinary.
{40455}{40520}Your presence when you plea|is mind-blowing.
{40530}{40554}Plead.
{40566}{40640}The way you throw words,|the way you speak...
{40671}{40731}When you say "alcoholic",
{40740}{40783}we can hear the glasses tinkling.
{40805}{40854}- Thank you very much.|- You're welcome.
{40867}{40937}You got a minute? I must tell you|of a thing. Very important.
{40943}{40981}You didn't kill anyone?
{41074}{41129}- You swear you won't tell?|- Of course.
{41132}{41170}- I swear, Audrey?|- I swear, Audrey.
{41173}{41223}- With your hand?|- I swear, Audrey.
{41245}{41315}There's no risk. I already|submitted my idea, so...
{41332}{41369}You'll understand...
{41371}{41432}- Come! We're going to the sea...|- Yeah, cool!
{41445}{41489}Are you coming?|... Come on, do!
{41496}{41535}I must prepare for tomorrow.
{41546}{41597}I've still got plenty to tell you.
{41617}{41661}- It's not too far?|- No, it's quite close.
{41695}{41761}- We can go, can't we?|- You've got at an appointment at 20:00.
{41807}{41870}Once a week, I must cover an event|that occurred in Monaco.
{41873}{41899}Anything.
{41905}{41998}Only a 3 minute subject after the weather|but I do what I want.
{42005}{42050}- Do I "pitch" my idea?|- Pitch!
{42065}{42134}The celebrities' pets.|What do you think of it?
{42155}{42222}The celebrities' pets... Indeed.
{42230}{42281}I sweated blood to say it.|Like it?
{42288}{42349}- Not bad!|- I was sure of it. We're in sync.
{42363}{42445}Now... If you say pet, you say|master. Right or wrong?
{42451}{42497}- Right.|- Now, that's where it gets great...
{42500}{42569}I ask someone famous to tell|about his cat or dog.
{42576}{42653}I need the celebrities now.|Barthez agrees.
{42665}{42802}His parrot imitates a brazilian|commentator and shouts: Goooooal!
{42836}{42964}What I'd like to know is if it's lawful|without getting the pet's permission.
{42987}{43087}I'm not a specialist of animals'|copyright but I feel...
{43090}{43142}Come! Come, it's ready!
{43223}{43306}It's great here, isn't it?|You see those clouds there?
{43317}{43378}Means the mistral will blow all week.
{43381}{43423}You can say it on tv.
{43429}{43509}If it was a tsunami... They'd open|the news with my forecast.
{43534}{43576}Come! I know a nice spot.
{43652}{43717}- You want sardines?|- No, not when I'm working.
{43756}{43802}Nothing ever happens here anyway.
{43818}{43858}Nothing can be great.
{43870}{43916}And your forecast is important.
{43934}{44013}Whole destinies can change|because of a light wind,
{44034}{44081}a light breeze, some rain.
{44088}{44145}You know of Sartre|and Simone de Beauvoir?
{44199}{44251}They first met in a cafÈ.
{44266}{44365}That day, there was rain,|a fine rain, almost nothing.
{44383}{44479}He said: let's stop here,|it's raining.
{44512}{44576}And they remained 40 years together.|You realize?
{44605}{44701}One of the most famous couples of the XXth|Century started on what? Nothing.
{44723}{44803}A few drops of rain.|So nothing can mean everything.
{44823}{44870}You never let go?
{44876}{44926}I was trying to widen the scope.
{44941}{44982}Undress and let's go for a swim.
{45110}{45135}You coming?
{45431}{45465}It's getting late.
{45499}{45558}- I don't like water at all.|- Don't go!
{45569}{45607}Water's great!
{45664}{45708}Come on! Undress!
{45716}{45749}{Y:i}It'll do you good.
{45909}{45939}{Y:i}It will sting!
{46025}{46069}That's it. I'll dress it.
{46105}{46201}Strangely enough, I had a good time.|Those guys are disarming.
{46269}{46303}Can you try and walk?
{46367}{46420}I feel all right.|Want a drink?
{46437}{46465}{Y:i}No thanks. I'm all right.
{46486}{46577}Audrey... I don't know.|I can't understand what she is.
{46617}{46652}Do you want a piece?
{46673}{46698}Thank you.
{46761}{46805}There may be nothing to understand.
{46914}{46946}How did you do with her?
{46972}{46993}Simple.
{47003}{47045}What do you mean, simple?
{47077}{47120}Straight to the point.
{47161}{47253}You're not interested in her, are you?|Because, except for...
{47272}{47314}- You have a problem with it?|- No,
{47328}{47355}no problem.
{47423}{47467}You had a long relationship with her?
{47480}{47504}No.
{47542}{47607}- Six months, a year?|- Much less.
{47649}{47728}Short but intense...|Sexually, I mean.
{47742}{47794}No complaint there.|Not bad.
{47822}{47870}Coming from you, that's a compliment.
{48053}{48078}Yes.
{48389}{48459}- We'd better not stay.|- I told you so.
{48477}{48500}{Y:i}Bertrand!
{48594}{48636}You came! It's cool!
{48656}{48677}Hi!
{48680}{48729}I'll introduce you to my parents.
{48744}{48771}They will be proud.
{48804}{48851}They redecorated.|You like?
{48910}{48946}Mum, dad... Bertrand.
{49038}{49093}Very kind of you to come, Sir.
{49096}{49135}Conselor, Mum... Counselor.
{49153}{49182}Pass the video camera.
{49185}{49217}Go all around him.
{49277}{49356}Turn towards Bertrand.|Move, Christopher. You're in the picture.
{49407}{49442}Can you smile, Bertrand?
{49488}{49520}Great! Fantastic!
{49538}{49572}We lost him.|He'll be mad.
{49723}{49777}That's it! My place!
{49842}{49872}Come in.
{49991}{50049}What will you have?|Malibu? Sky?
{50101}{50135}- Sky.|- O. k.
{50285}{50314}You like her?
{50354}{50422}A lot.|When she died, I had a revelation.
{50435}{50505}When she died, she had everything.|I had nothing but I was alive.
{50512}{50608}I started smiling, laughing, pretending|I was the most beautiful girl in the world.
{50611}{50642}And they all believed it.
{50662}{50685}Of course.
{50705}{50739}What does it inspire you?
{50765}{50842}You're not your usual self.|You say yes, you say no.
{50855}{50905}You talk much more usually.
{50921}{50949}I'm listening to you.
{51052}{51113}When I saw you on tv,|it triggered something inside me.
{51148}{51185}I felt tinglings.
{51198}{51231}I believe in meetings.
{51252}{51282}It's in my karma.
{51298}{51360}- Karma! You mean chance?|- No,
{51367}{51409}There's no such thing as chance.
{51421}{51484}Since you've been here,|everything is cool.
{51500}{51531}Is that chance?
{51945}{51991}I can't believe it. A real watch dog!
{52005}{52026}Let's go, counselor!
{52029}{52089}- What is it, Christophe?|- I can't believe it.
{52096}{52127}You plan on staying here?
{52146}{52174}For now, yes.
{52185}{52250}- Is it a problem to you?|- I must search the place.
{52295}{52338}{Y:i}This is ridiculous, Christophe.
{52557}{52591}Right? Are you finished?
{52646}{52723}- Raise your arms.|- You overdo it a little.
{52753}{52834}Any stranger staying with you|must be security checked.
{52841}{52942}- Avoid the palpations.|- No, no problem.
{53008}{53059}It's a trick to grope girls.
{53088}{53132}- Go straight at it.|- I know it all.
{53147}{53177}You didn't say so once.
{53220}{53280}- It's all right, Sir.|- Now go and have fun!
{53341}{53366}I'll be downstairs.
{54217}{54246}Seems a bit fast to me.
{54282}{54316}I don't know why we're waiting.
{54344}{54410}It's fast. I assure you.|Really fast.
{54719}{54802}I don't want you to be disappointed.|My sexuality is not exceptional.
{54922}{54948}Take me in the ass.
{55062}{55087}Straight out!
{55182}{55209}{Y:i}Christophe.
{55325}{55378}- What time is it?|- I don't know.
{55392}{55444}- I fell asleep.|- Don't you notice anything?
{55465}{55496}- No.|- Look at me.
{55518}{55576}- I can see you.|- What just happened is not human.
{55599}{55688}If you knew what she did to me,|what she invented all night long.
{55695}{55780}That curved body,|shameless, boundless...
{55828}{55861}It never stopped.
{55882}{55939}There's pleasure and nothing else.|Incredible!
{55963}{55994}You fucked, no more.
{56052}{56077}Exactly.
{56121}{56201}What I try to make the Court|understand, Mrs Lassalle,
{56221}{56277}is that, before meeting Mr Datchev,
{56289}{56360}the life you led was perfectly|organized.
{56363}{56415}Everything was controled, planned.
{56437}{56517}You wanted to be protected from|the slightest unevenness.
{56535}{56563}from the slightest slip.
{56589}{56637}When he came, everything changed.
{56673}{56716}You lost your head, Mrs. Lassalle.
{56740}{56781}You were confronted to feelings,
{56790}{56886}emotions that, for the first time,|you could not control.
{56908}{56971}Something alive was taking you away.
{57010}{57088}You let everything go.|You didn't control things any more.
{57163}{57257}What did you do in the hours|that followed Mr. Datchev's death?
{57290}{57357}I wanted to go see my daughter|living in Paris but I couldn't.
{57410}{57432}Why?
{57496}{57555}As soon he saw the body,|my son called the police.
{57593}{57624}I wouldn't have run away.
{57674}{57731}My only regret is not|to have seen my daughter.
{57785}{57880}I think you're quite optimistic.|Her last sentence left a bad impression.
{57888}{57959}You didn't understand.|Something opened today.
{57967}{58022}She looked fragile and|everybody saw it.
{58036}{58103}For the first time, I saw|I could break her shell.
{58117}{58182}Stop being a killjoy.|We're making progress.
{58193}{58216}See you, Alain.
{58233}{58270}Do you know|where I could find a sword?
{58309}{58360}Hello, welcome|to the pirates' night.
{58448}{58538}It's nice... exotic...|tropical.
{58566}{58613}We won't stay long, I promise you.
{58665}{58706}Make an effort, Christophe.
{58721}{58770}Think of Gauguin,|of "Treasure island".
{58801}{58848}It's a party|to promote industrial punch.
{58874}{58948}How uptight you are. Enjoy!|The girls are beautiful!
{58974}{59018}You're fine?|Nice necklace!
{59026}{59063}Where's Audrey?|Is she with you?
{59066}{59126}For Audrey, see Bouli,|he is in charge!
{59321}{59370}Excuse me... Are you Bouli?
{59373}{59432}- Yes.|- Do you know where Audrey Is?
{59440}{59490}With the people from tv,|over there.
{59493}{59519}Thank you very much.
{59620}{59655}She forgot all about you.
{59674}{59722}She told me to come.|I'm sure she'll come.
{59734}{59766}Now, she's working.
{59800}{59830}We're wasting our time here.
{59833}{59871}Why are you such a naysayer?
{59995}{60050}- Did she leave you?|- No.
{60065}{60136}Nothing to be ashamed of!|- She's not the kind of girl you leave.
{60161}{60190}It works or it doesn't.
{60202}{60231}Was it long ago?
{60234}{60280}- Two years.|- Quite recent then.
{60283}{60335}Wait, I think she's calling me.
{60982}{61017}That behavior is normal?
{61033}{61067}It's normal. She's a whore.
{61077}{61129}No, it's somewhat extreme, but...
{61135}{61230}I usually have an intuition about women.|Here I don't know.
{61278}{61322}She exposes herself. It's crazy.
{61439}{61485}I wonder|if you aren't making her run away.
{61506}{61597}Come on, move away. You said|6 yards. There aren't 6 yards.
{61756}{61785}I'm joking, right?
{62034}{62059}We've got to go now.
{62295}{62393}I was looking for you everywhere.|I thought you'd left.
{62419}{62448}Come, I'll videotape you.
{62451}{62494}- Lord Nelson has left?|- Yes.
{62512}{62533}This is ridiculous.
{62576}{62655}Come on, jump!|Please, do it for me.
{62668}{62696}Come on, do it!
{62723}{62810}Come on, do it.|Please, do it for me.
{62838}{62867}You're too cute.
{63214}{63240}Then, to bed.
{64005}{64047}Sir... Sir...
{64066}{64092}Can you hear me?
{64110}{64149}Sir... You'll be all right.
{64156}{64214}- Bertrand, are you all right?|- Enough bullshit. Get off!
{64236}{64287}I'll put you on your side.|Let me do it.
{64346}{64371}That's it!
{64672}{64711}I can't understand a word.
{64738}{64862}Right... Bring a microphone to|the defender so that we can hear.
{64871}{64929}It's useless, I've lost my voice.
{65038}{65063}Take this.
{65152}{65194}Making love is not good for you, Sir.
{65208}{65267}You're right, she's impossible.
{65298}{65349}You're strong, you were able to resist.
{65352}{65393}My health is not good enough. I can't.
{65444}{65505}{Y:i}See that yellow one?|It's an exoria poseida.
{65517}{65557}{Y:i}It changes color for the love parade.
{65613}{65661}After mating, he can sleep a whole year.
{65668}{65694}He's lucky!
{65726}{65789}- You know a lot about marine life.|- I'm from Monaco.
{65815}{65841}Thanks!
{65853}{65886}- It's a nice place.|- Yes.
{65919}{65965}- So you were born here?|- Yes.
{65972}{66011}The whole family. On the Rock.
{66027}{66105}You've always had|so structured a life?
{66111}{66180}No. I also got into trouble.|Nothing much.
{66203}{66238}You weren't there to plead.
{66280}{66333}- What happened?|- Nothing much at first.
{66357}{66395}A fight outside a night club.
{66407}{66457}I hit the roof quickly at the time.
{66484}{66527}Now you look so quiet.
{66545}{66634}Thanks to my job.|Anger management, self control.
{66643}{66683}No alcohol, Krav maga.
{66694}{66724}- Krav what?|- Maga.
{66742}{66777}It's hebrew. It means close combat.
{66807}{66849}What are your usual customers?
{66878}{66932}VIP's, business men,
{66947}{67006}show biz, emirates...|It comes and goes.
{67036}{67083}I rarely have real contacts with someone.
{67159}{67234}- Thank you for everything.|- I'm only doing my job.
{67250}{67283}It's much more than that.
{67304}{67347}I want you to feel fine tomorrow.
{67372}{67440}- You must win that case.|- It's that important to you?
{67455}{67505}Yes, you do something useful.
{67516}{67562}You save people, guilty or not.
{67591}{67642}It's good.|Tomorrow, hot lemon, right?
{67672}{67732}Tomorrow, hot lemon,|no croissant.
{69212}{69282}The best lays are always|the guys who look uptight.
{69306}{69382}I don't believe you.|You just want to be nice.
{69415}{69462}And your appeal is an atomic bomb.
{69533}{69595}I'm glad you came.|My spirits were not really high.
{69646}{69711}For the pets, it didn't work.|Barthez left me down.
{69720}{69783}- He did?|- He didn't want to be filmed.
{69809}{69858}His parrot bit me.|Bloody rat!
{69895}{69931}I must find another idea.
{69972}{70056}Demis Roussos has got a small bulldog.|But they're both in sleep therapy.
{70082}{70133}I feel bad.|I don't know what to do.
{70254}{70292}{Y:i}Your lover's there waiting.
{70300}{70329}He is downstairs?
{70361}{70434}Be careful. Soon he will|ask you to have sex.
{70483}{70528}You know you must tell me|when you go away.
{70545}{70608}She was not feeling well.|She's in trouble, you know.
{70622}{70686}With her program: celebrities' pets.
{70703}{70724}What?
{70727}{70756}Celebrities' pets.
{70779}{70844}She was desperate, I feared that|she made some mistake.
{70885}{70907}Of course.
{70913}{70967}I could not let her all night|with that sort of ideas.
{71369}{71392}Hi there!
{71415}{71480}- I didn't sleep at all.|- I had a great idea.
{71553}{71626}Counselor Beauvois, can you tell us|who's your favorite criminal?
{71633}{71668}Come on! It's ridiculous.
{71676}{71765}Come on, pussy, if you wanted to,|you could save my life.
{71777}{71812}I've already got the title.
{71852}{71918}"In Counselor Beauvois's gown. "|What do you think?
{71965}{72030}The idea is to be close to you,
{72036}{72081}no taboo, no double talk because
{72084}{72152}the people don't know counselor|Beauvois under the gown.
{72166}{72211}Well, I'm the only one who knows.
{72230}{72308}It would be like "The new star"
{72329}{72369}but more on the legal side.
{72379}{72407}What do you think of it?
{72413}{72471}A lawyer was never interesting|to anyone.
{72474}{72548}But Hubert, the announcer, thinks|it's great. Look!
{72643}{72717}You're cute there, like a little boy.|No one has seen you that way.
{72725}{72758}{Y:i}I have a funny face, haven't I?
{72810}{72851}{Y:i}It's funny. You don't realize...
{72856}{72944}{Y:i}We'll be together all the time.|I'll be with you 24/24.
{73106}{73139}Cleaned and ironed.
{73159}{73235}Christophe, room service|does that, you know?
{73240}{73295}In the hotel.|- There it's perfect.
{73323}{73366}- Why are you looking at me?|- I'm not.
{73384}{73431}Move on... Vai, vai.
{73507}{73533}I'll get the car.
{73917}{73958}It's nothing. Only a few minutes.
{73985}{74020}It's funny and it helps her.
{74087}{74159}Trust me. I know when to stop.
{74182}{74220}Don't look at the camera.
{74252}{74317}You have a look of concentration.|You're getting to work.
{74372}{74398}Go to your desk.
{74431}{74463}Slowly, sit down slowly.
{74505}{74564}You open your files,|you look at them.
{75608}{75647}Being here with you is moving.
{75673}{75703}That's where it happened.
{75754}{75783}Can you film us, please?
{75810}{75862}All you have to do is press here.
{75892}{75949}- You won't?|- It's not part of my job.
{75967}{76021}What's your job?|Why are you here?
{76037}{76064}Where are your mafiosi?
{76123}{76161}Hell! I am not asking much.
{76176}{76211}- Audrey!|- What, Audrey?
{76217}{76253}That moment would look great.
{76256}{76311}Look at the sight. That bastard|won't move his ass.
{76317}{76351}You've got a real scoop!
{76361}{76412}You never understood me.|You're an asshole.
{76419}{76466}Only college graduates|can understand you...
{76497}{76524}It makes you laugh!
{76547}{76580}I'm fed up! You're pissing me off!
{76624}{76662}How long will it go on?
{76665}{76718}- Listen...|- Stop telling yourself stories.
{76725}{76814}Today, it's Princess Grace, tomorrow,|you'll be in your undies in the aquarium.
{76822}{76870}You go on like this,|she'll ruin your case.
{76877}{76932}You calm down,|don't speak to me that way.
{76949}{76979}I know what I must do.
{76982}{77044}You'll go on like this, saying yes|to everything, like a girl.
{77055}{77120}Don't you understand|she won't leave you alone?
{77140}{77203}May I remind you you're paid|to watch my front door?
{77252}{77320}If I needed a body guard for advice,|I'd know about it.
{77346}{77399}- You've been warned.|- What do you think?
{77402}{77433}That I can't do without you?
{77649}{77739}What are you waiting for?|Will you drive me to the hotel?
{77922}{77969}Well... I should get cross more often.
{78009}{78069}- They had them in dark red.|- No, I love the color.
{78138}{78175}Can you find a cigarette?
{78207}{78231}Of course.
{78733}{78776}I left the car in the parking.
{78820}{78876}- I could not find any, darling.|- I took chewing gum.
{78924}{78964}Do you realize what's happening?
{78977}{79006}It's not chance.
{79017}{79071}When I spoke of karma...|That's what it is.
{79078}{79133}Since I met you,|I've felt orange energy.
{79153}{79236}It's fluid that goes there|and up to here.
{79252}{79313}In the book of energies,|orange is the rarest color.
{79321}{79391}In some lives, it never appears.|It's horrible, isn't it?
{79412}{79464}- There are books on this?|- Yes.
{79495}{79541}I like it when you listen to me.
{79578}{79622}There's something we've not tried yet...
{80138}{80158}Yeah!
{80207}{80244}Yeah, it's cool.|I'm asking.
{80257}{80289}What's the room number?
{80774}{80815}Come on, there's a surprise.
{81892}{81933}Wait, you haven't seen the present yet.
{81936}{81987}Where is it?|What is it?
{82211}{82259}Tell me, excuse me...|Where's Audrey?
{82282}{82322}- She didn't tell you?|- Tell what?
{82349}{82398}Forget it! You've got a car?
{82406}{82425}Yes.
{83027}{83120}- I hope you didn't make a mess in my place.|- You'll thank us all your life.
{83620}{83671}Let's leave them. He's wanted|to have her for so long.
{83674}{83699}To have whom?
{83702}{83753}Audrey, he's the only one|who didn't have her.
{83766}{83836}It's revolting.|Everyone can't have her.
{83839}{83901}You've had her.|And it was not even your birthday.
{84291}{84331}Where shall we go? To Nice?
{84498}{84563}The pill of love. Swallow it.|You'll feel better.
{84572}{84597}It's not a good idea.
{84709}{84772}You know the "Doux Sud" in Juan?|- No.
{84775}{84817}Come on, start!|I'll tell you the way.
{85033}{85072}Want me to drive?
{86247}{86327}Counselor... I didn't know|you came to that sort of place.
{86399}{86424}Shall I buy you a drinlk?
{86449}{86472}No, thanks.
{86496}{86567}I wanted to talk to you. You know|I'll testify tomorrow.
{86595}{86628}You don't look all right...
{86637}{86682}- Leave me alone.|- What's wrong with you?
{86717}{86761}You want me to go get your bodyguard?
{86769}{86807}Leave me alone.
{86830}{86885}I hope that girl|is not too much trouble.
{86938}{86976}She's already left you?
{87030}{87072}You're crazy! You're sick!
{87932}{87991}I don't know what they made me|swallow in the tunnel.
{88037}{88081}It's forbidden to pedestrians, right?
{88192}{88243}She left me for that fat guy.
{88264}{88312}You know that fat guy?
{88768}{88846}I want to thank you.|Thank you very much.
{88863}{88894}Care for a coffee?
{88902}{88928}Yes please.
{89006}{89050}It's very tidy here.
{89098}{89161}- How many square meters?|- 32.
{89215}{89248}{Y:i}You lead a lonely life.
{89257}{89321}In my job, you must be|available 24/24
{89335}{89371}You can't have a family.
{89432}{89500}- I don't want to go.|- Of course you will.
{89557}{89606}That woman is like a wall.
{89637}{89661}She counts on you.
{89747}{89844}My father had a garage. He was cheated.|His lawyer didn't give a damn.
{89866}{89897}He lost everything.
{89912}{89964}I don't know what to do.
{89978}{90008}I rang your assistant.
{90046}{90108}You have testimonies and|the coroner report.
{90114}{90144}And Lassalle son.
{90154}{90202}- Ah yes... Shit!|- Why?
{90208}{90249}We had an argument yesterday.
{90291}{90325}Don't look at the spelling.
{90339}{90395}Mine can be faulty too sometimes.
{90421}{90446}Not in the same way.
{90496}{90542}You were right.|Audrey is terrifying.
{90553}{90614}She is a witch.|A modern one at that.
{90624}{90737}Her sexuality is abysmal and|she believes in colored fluids.
{90775}{90824}Worst part is that I want to see her.
{90868}{90901}Mr. Louis Lassalle?
{90936}{91010}When Dimitri Datchev was not|working for your mother,
{91038}{91122}did you sometimes ask for his help?
{91133}{91158}Sometimes.
{91179}{91255}Can you tell us what jobs he did for you?
{91268}{91371}He would drive me at the doctor's,|at parties, at friends, everywhere.
{91394}{91443}Did he go with you in bars,
{91456}{91500}- discos?|- Never.
{91547}{91607}It's no secret you go out|a lot at night, is it?
{91629}{91664}I even meet you sometimes.
{91689}{91756}Tell me, Mr. Lassalle,|you never married?
{91772}{91793}Never.
{91818}{91847}Did you think of it?
{91862}{91893}It didn't happen.
{91945}{92015}You never met the right woman?
{92034}{92134}Or would you say your desires|led you onto other paths?
{92181}{92231}I see no reason to answer.
{92365}{92387}Let go of me!
{92401}{92425}Quiet, please!
{92479}{92521}What's with you? I thought you were zen.
{92524}{92613}You know how how much concentration is|needed in a trial? You don't give a damn.
{92616}{92657}What right have you to say so?
{92660}{92728}You come in... out. You cause bloody chaos.|You think his work is easy?
{92737}{92769}What do you know about law?
{92788}{92875}I'll say it calmly... don't come close|to him. He won't see you any more.
{92886}{92934}Who says so? You or he?
{92939}{92990}- You go to bed with him?|- I know how he feels.
{93002}{93048}He doesn't give a damn about you.
{93073}{93144}When he's gone, you won't exist,|you'll go back watching your parkings!
{93147}{93179}Don't come near him.
{93212}{93241}It can't be true...
{93257}{93286}You're in love?
{93315}{93344}Shove off!
{93367}{93390}I won't.
{93409}{93434}Shove off!
{93659}{93729}Dimitri Datchev|was hired by your mother.
{93795}{93894}In that intimacy,|in that daily threesome,
{93897}{93951}you started having contradictory
{93972}{94047}feelings towards him.
{94098}{94174}You are a clever man.|You were aware of that.
{94189}{94304}As the days went by, slowly, you realized|the situation was getting dangerous.
{94315}{94386}He was your mother's lover.|You were on forbidden grounds.
{94402}{94518}That growing desire finally got|the better of you. You could not help it.
{94563}{94600}You did not resist.
{94682}{94708}Mr. Lassalle...
{94846}{94893}Were you Dimitri Datchev's lover?
{94967}{94992}Yes.
{95007}{95040}When did your mother know?
{95068}{95094}The day before.
{95121}{95163}Under what circumstances?
{95172}{95243}I told her. I couldn't bear|the idea of his going with her.
{95262}{95308}I told her I would leave with Dimitri.
{95345}{95379}How did she react?
{95412}{95447}She listened, said nothing.
{95477}{95519}She went up to her room.
{95590}{95626}I didn't see her again before...
{95860}{95968}Hello, my love. This is version 1|of my movie. Don't be too harsh.
{95981}{96053}You're my first spectator.|Your opinion means a lot.
{96056}{96078}Kisses.
{96086}{96157}"In Bertrand Beauvois's gown"
{96172}{96250}{Y:i}Bertrand Beauvois is a lawyer,|dreaded in every Court.

{96608}{96671}{Y:i}available, everyone can speak to him.
{96688}{96754}{Y:i}The mildness, the fresh air
{96765}{96815}{Y:i}the easy living in our principality
{96820}{96857}{Y:i}won his heart.
{96871}{96916}{Y:i}Counselor Beauvois loves our city,
{96925}{97002}{Y:i}its history, with its pump|and its tragedies.
{97017}{97094}{Y:i}In spite of the importance|of his work,
{97097}{97169}{Y:i}Bertrand Beauvois knows how to party.
{97175}{97208}{Y:i}He has friends of all ages...
{97264}{97308}When do they show that masterpiece?
{97323}{97348}It's pathetic.
{97412}{97485}I'll ring her.|I'll ring her at once.
{97552}{97583}Who else can do it?
{97631}{97656}No one.
{97772}{97825}My parents have closed for us.|It's nice, isn't it?
{97847}{97898}They thought you'd want some quiet.|Tomorrow is D day.
{97914}{97966}It's nice, but you shouldn't have.
{98055}{98105}- It's from de 'eart|- Thank you.
{98115}{98149}Come, let's sit, sweetheart!
{98168}{98193}We'll leave you.
{98356}{98396}Audrey... Listen...
{98404}{98452}Listen... I watched the film.
{98461}{98497}Ah... you found the time?
{98504}{98535}Cool... You liked it?
{98551}{98592}Hubert wants to show it on Sunday.
{98598}{98632}It... No way.
{98660}{98689}You're handsome tonight.
{98737}{98776}Why do you tell me those things?
{98868}{98936}What's going on?|Your hands are sweaty.
{98960}{99011}- They're not!|- You're sweating! Loook!
{99014}{99040}No, I'm fine.
{99257}{99297}- Audrey...|- Drink your champagne!
{99418}{99462}- What do you think of it?|- Awful!
{99488}{99558}Last bottle left from our parents'|wedding. We opened it for you.
{99587}{99618}To us!
{99767}{99821}- Audrey...|- I've thought things over, Bertrand!
{99854}{99901}We can't go on like this.|It goes nowhere.
{99924}{99961}It's true. You're right.
{99967}{100014}We're going nowhere.|Don't you think?
{100024}{100057}Yes... yes.
{100077}{100109}We feel the same. Good!
{100139}{100175}It's a nice encounter.
{100183}{100231}In 2 days, you'll go back.|I can't stand it.
{100240}{100301}Life goes on.|What else can we do?
{100316}{100338}It's possible.
{100371}{100397}I can go with you.
{100420}{100468}I can leave everything here.|No problem!
{100477}{100531}Family, buddies, weather report.|I don't care!
{100538}{100573}What I want is to be with you.
{100640}{100703}Taste this at once.|It mustn't wait.
{100893}{100939}It's very good.|Oregano, isn't it?
{101090}{101131}I haven't washed my hands for 8 days.
{101163}{101187}Want to know why?
{101201}{101225}To keep your smell.
{101282}{101341}I'd never have thought|I could be with someone like you.
{101395}{101424}Know what Diana said?
{101445}{101500}That lack of love is|the worst disease in the world.
{101517}{101560}Even in the end when she left Charles,
{101576}{101623}all she cared for was|the nobility of the heart.
{101655}{101687}Though she'd lost everything,
{101705}{101747}her money, her way of life.
{101760}{101785}Even her dogs.
{101798}{101820}Please...
{101864}{101914}You can't imagine being|with a girl like me...
{101940}{101960}Can you?
{102011}{102063}I wouldn't blame you.|I know where I come from.
{102158}{102196}But don't tell me now.
{102325}{102350}I think I love you.
{102537}{102564}I won't go.
{102631}{102680}Ring Alain.|He'll replace me.
{102689}{102713}You can't do that.
{102736}{102767}I can't plead.
{102779}{102816}But you're going to win.
{102821}{102864}I'm exhausted. I... I...
{102872}{102922}I can't fight.|I'm going into pieces.
{102953}{103023}- I can stop her getting into the Court room.|- That's not the problem.
{103037}{103085}She wants to come and live|in Paris with me.
{103097}{103188}She's planning her moving away,|her first baby's birth.
{103228}{103258}Do you love her?
{103319}{103370}I don't know. She's there,
{103373}{103417}she invades me, she is my obsession.
{103428}{103492}Damn, it's hell.|You can't go on like this.
{103506}{103587}You won't let that girl destroy you.|You need to have balls.
{103603}{103657}Balls! Always balls!
{103677}{103714}I won't always be there to help.
{103723}{103778}Without you, I wouldn't be|in such a mess.
{103788}{103809}Without me?
{103812}{103889}You told me she was a sexual prodigy,|that she was a bomb.
{103903}{103956}That I had to be simple.|All the bullshit!
{104006}{104032}You're tired.
{104101}{104137}You were supposed to protect me.
{104180}{104209}See how you did it.
{104248}{104276}Are you proud?
{104316}{104352}What do you propose?
{104419}{104444}Find some idea.
{104678}{104735}Oh, My God!|Do something.
{104756}{104805}I don't want to see her any more!
{104890}{104917}Hello, my sweet.
{105065}{105090}Let's make peace.
{105238}{105297}You should have worn your blue shirt.|It "flashed" more with your eyes.
{105338}{105380}A fresh pineaple juice, please!
{105383}{105457}With croissant and toast|with honey and marmalade.
{105470}{105492}Thanks.
{105538}{105586}Stop drinking coffee!|It will stress you!
{105597}{105622}It's decaff.
{105639}{105714}Don't worry. It will work.|I'll send you positive waves.
{105955}{106037}Shit! My movie camera!|I forgot it in my scooter at Bouli's.
{106044}{106086}Hell! I won't have you pleading.
{106092}{106136}You can't shoot in the Court Room.
{106159}{106209}- Go! I'll come later.|- I can take her.
{106246}{106265}True?
{106291}{106336}Yes, I can go on my own.
{106361}{106396}Keep the car. Mine is close.
{106424}{106453}We'll see you later.
{106497}{106552}- Take your time.|- See you, sweetheart.
{106847}{106930}It's starting to rain. I had told so|in my bulletin. I was right.
{106967}{107017}What's wrong? You quarrelled?
{107047}{107071}No.
{107104}{107129}Not because of me?
{107177}{107205}May I put some music on?
{107306}{107366}I love that song.|It brings back good memories.
{107379}{107421}- Not to you?|- No, not to me.
{107586}{107632}- You're a sexy driver.|- Stop it!
{107645}{107679}Come on! You want it too!
{107708}{107781}Remember your fit in front of my door?|You woke up the whole building.
{107831}{107855}What a laugh!
{107938}{107960}So funny!
{108582}{108617}Why are we stopping here?
{108714}{108739}What's that look?
{108820}{108844}What do you want?
{108940}{108975}Say it...
{109051}{109078}We can talk too.
{109110}{109147}That's not what you really want.
{109253}{109275}Listen!
{109289}{109357}I know it's silly.|We'll be sorry afterwards.
{109392}{109440}Say one word and I'll stop.
{109649}{109673}Shall I stop?
{111044}{111081}My scooter! Shit!
{111108}{111162}Damaged!|Are you going to help me?
{111271}{111318}What are you waiting for?
{111407}{111431}Hurry!
{111627}{111659}I'm fine. Don't worry!
{111667}{111719}We never did anything, right?|Forget it!
{111745}{111771}Let's hurry!
{111807}{111841}What about lunch in San Remo?
{111860}{111913}Are you crazy?|You want to have lunch!
{111920}{111960}- Bertrand must be waiting for me.|- He is not!
{111985}{112031}- He never will.|- What are you saying?
{112055}{112086}It's over.
{112124}{112154}You thought it was serious?
{112244}{112296}You don't get it, do you?|We'll get married.
{112302}{112356}We'll live together in Paris.|I'll meet his friends.
{112372}{112409}I won't let that chance pass by.
{112417}{112498}You want to spend your life as a guard|at the casino, that's your problem.
{112541}{112589}I'm not ashamed. Yes I will succeed.
{112596}{112657}I didn't work my ass off for nothing.|I will be a star.
{112683}{112709}What sort of star?
{112722}{112791}Poor guy!|I really feel sorry for you at times!
{112796}{112868}Tomorrow I'll take the plane with him.|For you, it's over!
{112889}{112916}Contract ended!
{113013}{113047}If you could see your face!
{116474}{116515}{Y:i}Since that trial started,
{116535}{116616}{Y:i}Mrs Lassalle has betrayed no feeling
{116630}{116703}{Y:i}she seems very far from here
{116740}{116873}It looks like she did everything to|prevent us to understand her secrets.
{116929}{116995}That mask impressed us all a lot.
{117002}{117070}She chose to entrench inside herself.
{117073}{117169}{Y:i}Yet should we conclude from her attitude|that she feels neither pain
{117197}{117219}{Y:i}nor remorse.
{117247}{117295}{Y:i}nor hope of forgiveness.
{117348}{117443}{Y:i}What does not express itself teaches|us about ourselves and about life...
{118089}{118154}I assure you it puzzles me...
{118162}{118243}I looked at the jury, especially|the women. They were deeply moved.
{118283}{118319}Congratulations, Counselor.
{118435}{118475}It was great. Congratulations!
{118839}{118874}Can I have a cigarette?
{118956}{118999}You're the last Gitanes smoker.
{119043}{119071}I do as my father did.
{119203}{119242}What did you think of my pleading?
{119276}{119298}Wonderful!
{119335}{119360}Thank you.
{119376}{119463}Her not being there helped me a lot.
{119550}{119597}Would you mind if I didn't wait with you?
{119637}{119692}No. Something wrong?
{119706}{119728}I'm fine.
{119760}{119790}You look tired.
{119801}{119833}You should take a holiday.
{119912}{119948}But... where is she?
{119986}{120022}She won't bother you any more.
{120066}{120091}{Y:i}Are you coming, Counselor?
{120151}{120192}{Y:i}My daughter says she'll get the minimum.
{120548}{120578}Here you are, Sir!
{120690}{120752}- Was your stay here nice?|- Perfect!
{120763}{120813}- Did someone ask for me?|- No, Sir.
{120844}{120892}What time shall I ask the taxi to come?
{120899}{120923}I'll tell you.
{121518}{121574}{Y:i}Counselor? Inspector Torrent.
{121585}{121628}Can I talk to you?
{121731}{121766}How did it happen?
{121805}{121870}Well... that's why I asked you|to come with me.
{121928}{121962}It is not a traffic accident.
{122036}{122063}What do you mean?
{122124}{122204}Miss Varela's scooter was hit|by another vehicle.
{122228}{122313}We have every reason to think that|your protection agent, Mr. Abadi
{122325}{122359}is responsible for that collision.
{122380}{122413}We are questioning him.
{122469}{122539}But he refuses to answer.
{123244}{123316}There's paint on the victim's scooter.
{123360}{123448}It matches with that of the rented Volvo|Mr. Abadi drove every day.
{123484}{123570}We are sure there was a collision|involving the two vehicles.
{124207}{124254}Excuse me... Can I get a drink of water?
{124269}{124291}Of course!
{124400}{124442}{Y:i}We've got to determine what happened.
{124457}{124546}You understand how important|your testimony is.
{124584}{124693}We don't know yet if it was a crime|or a hit and run traffic accident.
{125474}{125492}{Y:i}Sir?
{125671}{125745}Mr Abadi has nothing to do|with Miss Varela's death.
{125787}{125851}I've kept the car the whole morning.
{125886}{125917}I was driving.
{125980}{126029}No one is responsible but me.
{126184}{126235}Mr. Abadi, you can go home.
{126293}{126334}Don't worry, Christophe.
{126365}{126411}I secured the area.
{126726}{126807}One year later...
{127290}{127327}{Y:i}One,|two
{127343}{127363}{Y:i}three,
{127366}{127403}{Y:i}four,|five.
{127521}{127543}{Y:i}One,
{127549}{127570}{Y:i}two,
{127573}{127593}{Y:i}three,
{127596}{127632}{Y:i}four, and five.
{127635}{127681}{Y:i}and six. Turn round.|One...
{127691}{127714}{Y:i}two, faster!
{127717}{127751}{Y:i}three and four,
{127758}{127792}{Y:i}and five, and six.
{127795}{127857}{Y:i}And one, and two,|and three,
{127865}{127919}{Y:i}and four, and five...|Move your feet... and one...
{127927}{127985}{Y:i}and two, and three,|and four,
{127994}{128015}{Y:i}and five...
{128801}{128827}Thank you.
{129355}{129390}Beauvois... mail!
{129509}{129535}Thank you!
{129779}{129803}{Y:i}Dear Sir,
{129833}{129883}{Y:i}I'm still here,|I won't be coming back soon.
{129916}{130011}{Y:i}I met some guy with whom|I'll work in a scuba diving center.
{130062}{130111}{Y:i}At minus 20 meters,|you don't think at all.
{130157}{130195}{Y:i}It is difficult to forget.
{130258}{130305}{Y:i}If you changed your mind,
{130311}{130372}{Y:i}I could come back at once.
{130434}{130488}{Y:i}Yours truly,|Abadi Christophe.
{130722}{130780}{Y:i}Tomorrow will be a sunny day,
{130804}{130854}{Y:i}20 to 22 degrees Celsius|in the afternoon
{130931}{130992}{Y:i}A solar wind will blow slowly|over the bay.
{131046}{131071}{Y:i}A clousless sky.
{131126}{131156}{Y:i}Summer is starting.
{131625}{131661}{Y:i}On the deserted beach,
{131710}{131759}{Y:i}all the shellfish
{131807}{131876}{Y:i}who would have thought so,|mourn the loss of summer,
{131912}{131956}{Y:i}which now has gone away...
{132008}{132078}{Y:i}We've put away the holidays,
{132096}{132166}{Y:i}in cardboard suitcases
{132209}{132277}{Y:i}and it's sad when you think of the season
{132297}{132358}{Y:i}of sun and songs.
{132398}{132480}{Y:i}Yet I know, next year,
{132498}{132566}{Y:i}All will bloom again,|we'll come back,
{132602}{132684}{Y:i}but in the meantime I feel sorry
{132702}{132775}{Y:i}to leave the sea and my house.
{132810}{132877}{Y:i}The north wind will get used
{132912}{132980}{Y:i}to run without the sail boats,
{133025}{133093}{Y:i}but it is in my uncombed hair
{133126}{133184}{Y:i}That I will miss it the most.
{133218}{133291}{Y:i}The sun, my good friend,
{133319}{133386}{Y:i}will only burn me from afar,
{133434}{133509}{Y:i}thinking that we're sore at each other
{133534}{133586}{Y:i}to be apart
{133623}{133698}{Y:i}The train will take me towards autumn,
{133726}{133800}{Y:i}back to the city in the rain
{133830}{133913}{Y:i}My pain will be for no one.
{133934}{134002}{Y:i}I'll keep as a friend.
{134042}{134104}{Y:i}But in the first days of summer,
{134145}{134211}{Y:i}forgetting all my troubles,
{134247}{134328}{Y:i}we'll come back and party with shellfish,
{134368}{134418}{Y:i}on the sunny beach.
