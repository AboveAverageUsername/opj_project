00:00:32.50,00:00:34.65
Zašto trpimo ovu prokletu klimu?

00:00:34.70,00:00:35.93
Mislim, vidi nas.

00:00:35.98,00:00:37.57
- Džeri ne može da govori.[br]- Uh?

00:00:37.62,00:00:39.42
- Lesli ne èuje.[br]- Šta?

00:00:39.46,00:00:42.21
- Margo ima lice kao crvena kaša.[br]- Uæuti!

00:00:42.26,00:00:45.09
- Majka izgleda kao irska pralja.[br]- Ne izgledam.

00:00:45.14,00:00:47.73
Avgust je! Treba nam sunce.

00:00:47.78,00:00:49.05
Da, dragi.

00:00:49.10,00:00:51.29
Imam prijatelja, živi u Grèkoj, na Krfu.

00:00:51.34,00:00:53.77
Kaže da je predivno.[br]Zašto se ne spakujemo i odemo?

00:00:53.82,00:00:56.73
Ne mogu tek tako da odem. Imamo kuæu ovde.

00:00:56.78,00:00:59.50
- Prodaæemo je.[br]- Ne budi smešan, Lorense.

00:00:59.54,00:01:02.01
- Džeri treba da se obrazuje.[br]- Ne, biæu u redu.

00:01:02.06,00:01:04.33
Ne možemo samo da se pokupimo i odemo.[br]To bi bilo ludilo.

00:01:19.66,00:01:22.65
Ovo je prièa o vremenu koje sam proveo na Krfu.

00:01:22.70,00:01:26.17
U poèetku je to trebalo da bude[br]blago nostalgièan opis

00:01:26.22,00:01:27.94
prirodne istorije ostrva,

00:01:27.98,00:01:32.85
ali sam napravio strašnu grešku[br]ubacivši u prièu svoju porodicu,

00:01:32.90,00:01:34.89
koja je polako preuzela.

00:01:34.94,00:01:39.77
Samo uz velike teškoæe[br]i koristeæi prilièno lukavstvo,

00:01:39.82,00:01:44.21
sam uspeo da saèuvem malo prostora[br]iskljuèivo za životinje.

00:01:53.94,00:01:56.25
- Šta je ovo?[br]- Larve.

00:01:56.30,00:01:58.29
Uskoro æe da postanu bube.

00:01:58.34,00:02:00.90
Vidi se po tome što im[br]koža postaje tamnija.

00:02:03.18,00:02:04.61
- On?[br]- Rodžer.

00:02:04.66,00:02:07.62
- Jako je važno imati psa.[br]

00:02:09.26,00:02:10.85
Ja sam pisac.

00:02:10.90,00:02:14.81
Ta je prilièno dobra.[br]Proziva razna buržoaska sranja.

00:02:27.30,00:02:28.29
Dobro.

00:02:33.98,00:02:35.89
Ovo, ne.

00:02:35.94,00:02:37.29
To je posteljina.

00:02:37.34,00:02:39.01
Roba. Porez.

00:02:40.86,00:02:43.21
To je naša posteljina! Smešni èoveèe.

00:02:43.26,00:02:47.17
Hajde majko. Izbegavajmo[br]iritantne ljude što je duže moguæe.

00:03:04.30,00:03:06.37
Da nije neki praznik?

00:03:22.50,00:03:25.49
Nisam baš ovakav doèek oèekivao.

00:03:27.98,00:03:29.70
Hajde. Joj! Joj!

00:03:29.74,00:03:32.13
Zašto neko nešto ne uradi?

00:03:32.18,00:03:33.41
Upomoæ!

00:03:34.42,00:03:36.17
Odlazi!

00:03:36.22,00:03:38.18
Oèi! Oèi!

00:03:38.22,00:03:40.73
- Sklonite ih![br]- Džeralde, sad.

00:03:59.18,00:04:00.82
Pa, svi deluju vrlo pristojno.

00:04:00.86,00:04:04.25
- Nisu hteli da mi daju toalet-papir.[br]- Pst. Nemoj za stolom.

00:04:04.30,00:04:07.53
Nisi pogledao dobro.[br]Imaš celu kutiju pored lavaboa.

00:04:07.58,00:04:10.09
- Margo, dušo.[br]- Šta?

00:04:10.14,00:04:13.05
Kutija je za papir koji je korišæen.

00:04:13.10,00:04:14.90
Ne može da proðe kroz ovdašnju kanalizaciju.

00:04:16.74,00:04:19.09
Ugh. Ne.

00:04:19.14,00:04:20.81
Koristila sam...

00:04:20.86,00:04:23.01
Da. Malo je nehigijenski.

00:04:23.06,00:04:26.85
Podseti me da potražim tifusnu groznicu[br]u knjizi na recepciji.

00:04:31.50,00:04:33.81
- Vrlo emotivne godine.[br]

00:04:33.86,00:04:37.33
Mogla bih da pošaljem sredstvo za dezinfekciju[br]u njenu sobu.

00:04:38.18,00:04:39.82
Evo ih.

00:04:39.86,00:04:42.01
Sigurna sam da imam tifusnu groznicu.

00:04:42.06,00:04:43.86
Oseæam se tako...

00:04:43.90,00:04:45.30
- tifusno.[br]- Žao mi je,

00:04:45.34,00:04:48.81
ali pokazali ste nam 10 kuæa[br]i nijedna nema kupatilo.

00:04:48.86,00:04:52.93
- Oh, ne opet.[br]- Kupatilo? Šta æe vam kupatilo?

00:04:52.98,00:04:54.94
Imate more.

00:04:56.98,00:05:00.69
Ali ovo je kolevka civilizacije.[br]Moraju imati kupatila.

00:05:01.94,00:05:04.53
Sami æemo naæi mesto.

00:05:04.58,00:05:05.85
Er...

00:05:05.90,00:05:07.46
Oh. Erm, er...

00:05:07.50,00:05:08.53
Taxi.

00:05:11.74,00:05:14.13
Mi ne govorimo grèki.

00:05:14.18,00:05:16.37
Planiramo da nauèimo.

00:05:19.14,00:05:21.13
Ooh. Ow.

00:05:21.82,00:05:23.62
Zašto ne uèiniš nešto, Leri?

00:05:23.66,00:05:25.85
Šta? Oni se samo ponašaju kao Grci.

00:05:31.58,00:05:33.54
Oi!

00:05:36.18,00:05:38.85
Treba vam neko ko govori vaš jezik?

00:05:41.18,00:05:43.17
Ovi vam dosaðuju?

00:05:43.22,00:05:44.73
- Ne, ne.[br]- Hej!

00:05:59.78,00:06:01.74
Dakle, taxi?

00:06:01.78,00:06:03.18
Gde hoces idete?

00:06:03.98,00:06:05.38
A?

00:06:09.06,00:06:11.73
Znas sta? Englezi uvek hoce kupatila.

00:06:11.78,00:06:14.13
Imam kupatilo u moja kuca.

00:06:14.18,00:06:16.17
Osam godina sam bio u Èikago.

00:06:16.22,00:06:19.58
Onda kazem, ''Spiro, zaradio si[br]dovoljno novac.'' I onda se vratim, a?

00:06:19.62,00:06:21.13
Donesem ovaj auto sa sobom.

00:06:21.18,00:06:22.98
Najbolje auto na ostrvu.

00:06:23.70,00:06:26.17
Ne lazem ni rec.

00:06:26.22,00:06:27.94
Gledajte gde vozite.

00:06:28.82,00:06:31.65
Svi engleski turista traze mene[br]kad doðu na ostrvo.

00:06:31.70,00:06:33.69
Da. Znas, erm...

00:06:33.74,00:06:35.49
da nisam Grcki...

00:06:35.54,00:06:37.77
da, voleo bih da sam Engleski.

00:06:44.98,00:06:47.62
Evo. Vila sa kupatila.

00:06:57.90,00:07:01.97
Izgledalo je kao da je vila stajala tamo[br]i èekala da stignemo.

00:07:02.02,00:07:03.98
Oseæali smo se kao da smo došli kuæi.

00:07:04.02,00:07:05.53
Uzeæemo je.

00:07:09.82,00:07:11.46
Džeri, da li bi mogao...

00:07:13.94,00:07:15.82
Jednom kad je Spiro preuzeo brigu,

00:07:15.86,00:07:19.53
zakaèio se za nas kao pijavica[br]i postao deo porodice.

00:07:19.58,00:07:21.93
Kao veliki, smeði, ružni anðeo,

00:07:21.98,00:07:24.45
nežno je brinuo o nama.

00:07:24.50,00:07:27.01
Ah, Lesli, æao. Veliki momak.

00:07:28.54,00:07:31.05
Gospo]o Darels. Imate sve?

00:07:44.54,00:07:47.37
- Gde su stvari od ovih ljudi?[br]- One su roba.

00:07:47.42,00:07:49.41
Dosli smo da ih uzmemo.[br]Hajde, donesi ih.

00:07:49.46,00:07:53.50
Carinski prokletnici, a? Sve ih znam.[br]Hej! Zasto ih otvorio, kuckin sine?

00:07:53.54,00:07:55.53
- To mi je posao.[br]- Posao, a?

00:07:55.58,00:07:57.81
Tretiras postene strance kao krijumcare, a?

00:07:57.86,00:07:59.85
To ti posao?

00:07:59.90,00:08:01.70
Prokletnici misle da poseduju ovo mesto.

00:08:02.86,00:08:04.26
Hajde!

00:08:10.58,00:08:14.02
- Ali, izgledas kao on. Izgledas kao on.

00:08:15.86,00:08:19.41
Džeri, ne èaèkaj koleno.[br]Hajde, Jedi svoj kounoupidi.

00:08:19.46,00:08:21.85
Hoæeš li da trkneš do moje sobe[br]i doneseš mi cigarete?

00:08:21.90,00:08:24.73
- Donesi ih sam.[br]- To je problem sa ovom porodicom.

00:08:24.78,00:08:28.82
- Nema solidarnosti, nema obzira prema drugima.[br]- Ti nemaš mnogo obzira prema drugima.

00:08:28.86,00:08:31.82
Majko, nije trebalo da nas vaspitaš[br]da budemo tako sebièni.

00:08:31.86,00:08:33.42
Nikad nisam tako nešto uradila.

00:08:33.46,00:08:35.61
Nismo postali sebièni bez ikakvih uputstava.

00:08:35.66,00:08:38.62
Hej. Trebalo bi da pazis sta pricas.

00:08:38.66,00:08:42.65
- Ne zelis da povredis majku.[br]- Zašto? Ona nikad ništa nije uradila za nas.

00:08:42.70,00:08:46.21
- Nemoj da se salis... Nemoj cak ni da se salis na taj nacin.[br]- Sasvim je u pravu.

00:08:46.26,00:08:50.62
- Ona uopšte nije naroèito dobra kao majka.[br]- Ne govori to. Ne govori to!

00:08:50.66,00:08:53.17
Boga mi, da ja imam ovakvu majku,

00:08:53.22,00:08:57.13
ljubio bih joj stope svako jutro do smrti.

00:09:16.94,00:09:18.66
Dakle, nastanili smo se u vili,

00:09:18.70,00:09:21.98
i svako od nas se smestio[br]i prilagodio okruženju,

00:09:22.98,00:09:24.89
na svoj naèin.

00:09:30.34,00:09:32.53
Da bih objasnio neka od naših èudnih ponašanja,

00:09:32.58,00:09:35.46
oseæam da bi trebalo da naglasim[br]da smo u vreme boravka na Krfu,

00:09:35.50,00:09:37.49
svi u porodici bili prilièno mladi.

00:09:37.54,00:09:39.93
Osim majke, èije godine nikad nismo znali,

00:09:39.98,00:09:44.05
iz prostog razloga[br]jer nije mogla da se seti kad je roðena.

00:10:01.90,00:10:03.41
- Oh.

00:10:22.26,00:10:24.85
Ko je parkirao ovog magarca ovde?

00:10:24.90,00:10:26.94
Zašto ga ne pomeriš ako ti smeta, dušo?

00:10:26.98,00:10:29.62
Buduæe generacije[br]ne bi trebalo da budu lišene mog rada

00:10:29.66,00:10:32.65
- zato što sam bio napolju rasterujuæi magarce.[br]- Probaj ovo.

00:10:32.70,00:10:34.34
Prokletstvo. Šta je to?

00:10:34.38,00:10:37.77
- Melitzana horiatiki.[br]- Zar cornflakes nije stigao?

00:10:37.82,00:10:41.21
Leri, dušo,[br]došli smo da probamo nove stvari.

00:10:41.26,00:10:43.22
Našao sam pauka krabu.

00:10:43.26,00:10:45.22
Ako ga staviš na list druge boje,

00:10:45.26,00:10:47.73
promeni boju ako saèekaš dovoljno dugo.

00:10:51.18,00:10:53.61
Zašto nosi te èizme[br]po ovoj vruæini?

00:10:53.66,00:10:55.65
- Zmije.[br]

00:10:55.70,00:10:57.93
- A džemper?[br]- Da ga ne izgubimo.

00:10:57.98,00:10:59.57
Vidi, ovo je velika porodica,

00:10:59.62,00:11:01.66
- ne bi joj škodilo malo proreðivanja.[br]

00:11:01.70,00:11:03.69
Za ime Boga!

00:11:07.26,00:11:08.82
- Mm.[br]- Mm.

00:11:08.86,00:11:12.69
- Hoæe li Lesli to raditi ceo dan?

00:11:12.74,00:11:16.37
To mu je hobi, svima nam treba neki hobi.[br]Nije mnogo dobar u drugim stvarima.

00:11:16.42,00:11:18.41
O, da, da, svima nam treba hobi.

00:11:18.46,00:11:20.45
- Uæuti!

00:11:22.54,00:11:25.13
Nisam sigurna da je sunèanje u tome[br]pametno.

00:11:25.18,00:11:28.30
Taj...kostim ne pokriva mnogo.

00:11:28.34,00:11:30.33
Ne budi tako staromodna.

00:11:30.38,00:11:32.37
Samo se jednom umire.

00:11:33.98,00:11:36.94
Znaš one crne gusenice[br]što sam mislio da su gusenice?

00:11:36.98,00:11:40.10
Nisu. To su bubamare koje su se tek izlegle.

00:11:40.14,00:11:42.37
- Ali izgledaju isto kao gusenice.[br]- Hm?

00:11:42.42,00:11:44.38
Da!

00:11:44.42,00:11:47.62
I one muve o kojima sam ti prièao...

00:11:47.66,00:11:50.41
- Da?[br]- One legu jaja u cveæu,

00:11:50.46,00:11:52.50
da bi... Isprièaæu ti kasnije.

00:11:56.70,00:11:59.01
- Gde ideš?[br]- Da istražujem.

00:11:59.06,00:12:00.57
Lepo se provedi.

00:12:00.62,00:12:02.42
Zna li mama?

00:12:02.46,00:12:05.18
Idem da istražujem!

00:12:08.14,00:12:12.77
U tim ranim danima istraživanja,[br]Rodžer je bio savršen saputnik za avanturu,

00:12:12.82,00:12:16.89
Privržen bez preterivanja,[br]hrabar ali ne i ratoboran,

00:12:16.94,00:12:21.17
inteligentan i pun razumevanja[br]za moje nastranosti.

00:12:39.46,00:12:41.05
Izvinite.

00:12:41.10,00:12:42.98
Znate li kako se piše ''Oprez''?

00:12:43.02,00:12:44.98
I ''Tišina''?

00:12:48.22,00:12:49.62
Nagaðaæu.

00:13:04.78,00:13:06.50
Oh, um...

00:13:29.90,00:13:31.62
Ah.

00:14:07.74,00:14:09.73
- Hvala.[br]

00:14:37.14,00:14:39.13
Još se nisu izlegli, Rodžere.

00:16:09.06,00:16:11.49
U redu, ali to je to.

00:16:11.54,00:16:13.02
Nema više kuænih ljubimaca.

00:16:14.98,00:16:18.45
- Kakve su mi pege, majko?[br]- Fine, dušo, jako si lepa.

00:16:18.50,00:16:21.06
Mm, jako tašta.[br]- Mamin sin.

00:16:21.10,00:16:22.98
Nisam! Zar ne, mama?

00:16:23.02,00:16:24.82
To je Ahilova omiljena hrana.

00:16:30.86,00:16:31.85
Džeri.

00:16:32.74,00:16:35.09
Možeš da skineš džemper.

00:16:38.58,00:16:40.54
Izgleda kao loše skuvano pile.

00:16:40.58,00:16:43.54
Oh, a jedan od Marginih...

00:16:43.58,00:16:46.78
obožavaoca je doneo ovo.

00:16:48.90,00:16:50.49
To je stajalo tamo sa razlogom.

00:16:50.54,00:16:53.82
Svejedno, pisanje ti je užasno.[br]Treba ti neka vrsta obrazovanja.

00:16:53.86,00:16:56.17
- Ne! Ne, ne treba.[br]- Da, mora da nauèi da pleše.

00:16:56.22,00:16:58.78
Ili æe postati jedan od[br]onih odvratnih smetenjaka.

00:16:58.82,00:17:00.78
Treba mu dobra osnova u književnosti.

00:17:00.82,00:17:03.17
- Predlažem Rabelea.[br]- Prestar je za Džerija, mislim.

00:17:03.22,00:17:05.78
Važno je da shvati seks[br]na pravi naèin.

00:17:05.82,00:17:08.33
Ti si opsednut seksom,[br]u sve ga uvlaèiš.

00:17:08.38,00:17:11.89
Zdrav život u prirodi je sve što mu treba.[br]Pusanje i plovidba.

00:17:11.94,00:17:13.45
Prièaš kao prokleti biskup.

00:17:13.50,00:17:16.01
- Tako si tvrdoglav![br]- Uæuti.

00:17:16.06,00:17:18.94
Deco, prestanite.[br]Vidite, treba nam neko ko æe da poduèava Džerija,

00:17:18.98,00:17:22.42
ali i podržavati njegovo interesovanje za divljinu.[br]- Zašto? To je samo faza kroz koju prolazi.

00:17:22.46,00:17:25.58
- Faza koja traje od njegove druge godine.[br]- Zašto uvek prièate o meni

00:17:25.62,00:17:28.42
kao da nisam tu?[br]- Moj prijatelj Džordž je još uvek ovde.

00:17:28.46,00:17:30.89
- On bi mogao da proba da ga poduèava.[br]- To je dobra ideja.

00:17:30.94,00:17:31.74
Mm-hm.

00:17:38.06,00:17:39.49
Um...

00:17:45.82,00:17:48.01
Možete li da ponovite pitanje? Još jednom.

00:17:52.54,00:17:56.77
Koliko dugo bi šestorica ljudi pravila zid

00:17:56.82,00:17:59.73
ako ga njih trojica prave nedelju dana?

00:18:01.78,00:18:02.97
Er...

00:18:07.98,00:18:09.62
Erm...

00:18:18.94,00:18:20.58
U redu. Um...

00:18:20.62,00:18:22.74
Ako dva crva

00:18:22.78,00:18:25.09
za nedelju dana pojedu osam listova,

00:18:25.14,00:18:29.21
koliko dugo bi èetiri crva[br]jela isti broj listova?

00:18:29.26,00:18:30.90
Kojih crva?

00:18:31.62,00:18:33.02
Bilo kojih!

00:18:34.50,00:18:37.01
On jednostavno ne želi da uèi.

00:18:37.06,00:18:39.89
Pa, naravno da ne želi, Džordže. Ima 12 godina.

00:18:39.94,00:18:43.93
I živi u onome što je za njega[br]ogromna prodavnica slatkiša.

00:18:43.98,00:18:46.49
Majko, ima li negde èistog veša?

00:18:47.22,00:18:48.21
Er...

00:18:48.26,00:18:51.77
Malo glasnije, Margo, dušo,[br]mislim da te nisu èuli u Makedoniji.

00:18:53.62,00:18:56.66
Možda bi trebalo da zatvoriš usta[br]pre nego što neki insekt uleti unutra.

00:18:58.78,00:19:02.01
Bože, baš si se zacrveneo.[br]Mogli bismo da ispeèemo pogaèu na tebi.

00:19:02.06,00:19:05.05
Ah, a-ali... Ona je, um... jako upeèatljiva.

00:19:05.10,00:19:09.81
Da. Verovatno je trebalo njoj da[br]navuèem onaj džemper, a ne Džeraldu.

00:19:09.86,00:19:14.85
A kad ga veæ pominjem, mislim da je rešenje[br]iskoristiti njegove prednosti, zar ne?

00:19:14.90,00:19:16.70
Pa, probao sam.

00:19:16.74,00:19:20.81
Znate, koliko je šest kakadua[br]puta sedam kakadua i te stvari.

00:19:21.90,00:19:23.25
42 kakadua.

00:19:24.46,00:19:26.21
Erm...da.

00:19:28.06,00:19:29.70
Oh.

00:19:29.74,00:19:34.42
Pa, u svakom sluèaju, erm...hajde da, erm,[br]popustimo još malo, hoæemo li?

00:19:34.46,00:19:37.93
I izvedite ganapolje.[br]Nije prirodno da bude unutra.

00:19:37.98,00:19:39.65
Kopile!

00:19:46.26,00:19:48.01
Kao što vidiš.

00:19:52.94,00:19:54.53
Dobro je.

00:19:54.58,00:19:56.89
I er, da ne zaboravimo istoriju.

00:19:56.94,00:19:59.61
Er, navedi imena Hanibalovih slonova[br]kojima je prešao Alpe.

00:20:00.66,00:20:02.41
- Bardi.[br]- Dobro.

00:20:02.46,00:20:04.02
Jespa.

00:20:04.06,00:20:05.21
Amito.

00:20:06.58,00:20:08.33
Surus.

00:20:09.06,00:20:10.81
Domito...

00:20:10.86,00:20:12.50
Sextus.

00:20:13.14,00:20:14.65
Titus.

00:20:14.70,00:20:16.74
Rašljar.

00:20:21.06,00:20:23.62
I, današnje lekcije su gotove.

00:20:23.66,00:20:25.09
Oèigledno.

00:20:26.50,00:20:29.06
Rašljar se pojavljivao relativno èesto

00:20:29.10,00:20:31.29
sa novim dodacima mojoj menažeriji.

00:20:31.34,00:20:35.05
Žabom, na primer,[br]ili belim golubom sa slomljenom nogom.

00:20:43.10,00:20:44.37
Èajni kolutiæ?

00:21:01.90,00:21:03.09
Ah.

00:21:46.54,00:21:48.53
Mmm.

00:21:52.10,00:21:53.58
Ovo je uzbudljiv deo.

00:21:53.62,00:21:55.77
Ometen nevoljnim uèenikom,

00:21:55.82,00:21:59.57
Džordž se trudio da uèini moje lekcije[br]što je moguæe zanimljivijim.

00:21:59.62,00:22:04.09
Dakle, Francuska i Britanska flota[br]su se polako približavale jedna drugoj,

00:22:04.14,00:22:06.65
i spremale se za odluèujuæu pomorsku bitku u ratu.

00:22:06.70,00:22:08.77
Morski puževi!

00:22:09.94,00:22:11.93
Video sam ih u knjizi.

00:22:12.94,00:22:15.50
Dobro. Kad je spazio neprijatelja, Nelson je...

00:22:15.54,00:22:16.94
- Ah![br]

00:22:20.14,00:22:23.42
Dobro. Nelson je bio na mostu...

00:22:24.02,00:22:27.53
posmatrajuæi ptice svojim teleskopom...

00:22:31.82,00:22:35.33
..i pošto ga je o primicanju neprijatelja obavestio[br]prijateljski nastrojeni galebl.

00:22:35.38,00:22:38.45
Ne. Nemoj da me pitaš koja vrsta galeba.

00:22:40.34,00:22:42.25
Teo.

00:22:42.30,00:22:45.81
Hajde.[br]On je uvrnuti ljubitelj prirode kao i ti.

00:22:45.86,00:22:48.74
I ekspert za praktièno sve.

00:22:48.78,00:22:51.53
Džerald Darel. Dr Teodor Stefanides.

00:22:51.58,00:22:53.62
- Oh, jako mi je drago da te upoznam.[br]- Oh, i Vas.

00:22:53.66,00:22:54.98
Ooh! Izvinite.

00:22:55.02,00:22:57.25
Zanimljivo.

00:22:57.30,00:22:59.34
Morski puž.

00:23:00.34,00:23:04.41
# Greensleeves was all my joy

00:23:04.46,00:23:06.45
# Greensleeves...

00:23:06.50,00:23:09.70
To je stvarno poslednji ljubimac kojeg dobija.

00:23:09.74,00:23:14.69
# Greensleeves was my heart of gold

00:23:14.74,00:23:20.69
# And who but my lady Greensleeves #

00:23:26.70,00:23:29.29
- To je bilo za pamæenje.[br]- Hvala.

00:23:29.34,00:23:31.69
Sviða mi se ovde.

00:23:32.42,00:23:34.46
Hoæu da budem sahranjena na Krfu.

00:23:34.50,00:23:37.30
Možemo li to sutra?[br]Malo je prohladno napolju.

00:23:37.34,00:23:39.85
Pod najveæim èempresom u dvorištu.

00:23:39.90,00:23:42.41
Rekla si iza Jani, èobaninove kuæe.

00:23:42.46,00:23:45.18
Da. Ali mislim da je to malo[br]nepristupaèno.

00:23:45.22,00:23:48.42
Ne želim da ožalošæeni padaju kao muve[br]na pola puta uz brdo.

00:23:50.06,00:23:52.18
Zdravo, Spiro. Spiro.

00:23:52.22,00:23:54.02
Jesi dobro?

00:23:54.06,00:23:55.70
Ne.

00:23:55.74,00:23:57.62
Gospoðica Margo je u pitanju.

00:23:59.18,00:24:00.58
Šta s njom?

00:24:00.62,00:24:02.13
Ona...

00:24:05.58,00:24:08.46
Ona ima deèka Turcina.

00:24:09.42,00:24:12.62
Šta fali tome? Osim što je Džordž[br]hteo da krene u akciju.

00:24:12.66,00:24:14.46
- Šteta, Džordži.[br]- Šta nije u redu?

00:24:14.50,00:24:17.49
Gospoðica Margo sa kopiletom,[br]kuèkinim sinom Turèinom.

00:24:17.54,00:24:19.50
Plivaju zajedno.

00:24:19.54,00:24:22.26
- Je l trudna?[br]

00:24:23.26,00:24:25.57
- Izvinite.[br]- Sigurno æe biti u redu.

00:24:25.62,00:24:27.42
Pozvaæemo ga na èaj.

00:24:28.30,00:24:29.78
Èaj?

00:24:29.82,00:24:33.21
Džeralde, imam poklon za tebe od Dr Tea.

00:24:34.22,00:24:37.26
- Ko je on, dušo?[br]- On je Džordžov prijatelj.

00:24:37.30,00:24:39.37
On sve zna.

00:25:04.62,00:25:06.89
Jedina osoba koju sam do sad sreo

00:25:06.94,00:25:10.45
koja je izgledala da deli moj entuzijazam[br]za zoologiju bio je Teo.

00:25:11.62,00:25:15.45
Bio sam jako polaskan[br]što je nauènik priliènog ugleda -

00:25:15.50,00:25:17.77
a ovo sam znao po njegovoj bradi -

00:25:17.82,00:25:21.21
razgovarao sa mnom kao[br]da znam isto koliko i on.

00:25:22.30,00:25:25.37
Ovo je pauk kiklop viridis,

00:25:25.42,00:25:28.78
kojeg, erm...[br]kojeg sam uhvatio blizu Govina pre neki dan.

00:25:35.10,00:25:36.82
Jedno oko na sred njegove glave!

00:25:36.86,00:25:39.74
Neverovatno, zar ne? Zato kiklop.

00:25:39.78,00:25:41.10
Kiklop.

00:25:41.14,00:25:45.93
Èekaj. Imam predivnu knjigu[br]o Grèkoj mitologiji ovde negde.

00:25:47.14,00:25:48.65
Um...

00:25:49.70,00:25:51.42
Kupio sam neke insekte.

00:25:53.46,00:25:55.81
Pitam se znate li šta su.

00:25:59.22,00:26:01.37
Džeri, mislim da æemo se jako lepo slagati.

00:26:05.62,00:26:07.58
Oh. Sad, ovo je... Huu.

00:26:08.82,00:26:11.65
Ove je jako teško uhvatiti.

00:26:17.54,00:26:19.53
Dakle, sad...

00:26:21.22,00:26:22.97
Trudnoæa.

00:26:23.02,00:26:26.01
Razmišljala sam da prièamo o ovome[br]jer je to...

00:26:26.06,00:26:28.05
važna tema i veoma...

00:26:29.46,00:26:31.02
divna.

00:26:31.06,00:26:32.54
I...

00:26:32.58,00:26:34.38
prilièno...

00:26:34.42,00:26:36.06
zbunjujuæa.

00:26:36.10,00:26:38.09
I èak...

00:26:39.30,00:26:40.65
šokantna.

00:26:40.70,00:26:42.13
Šta?

00:26:42.18,00:26:46.01
Znam sve o tome. Stalno gledam životinje[br]kako se pare i poraðaju se.

00:26:46.06,00:26:47.57
Pa, izgledalo mi je malo èudno.

00:26:47.62,00:26:50.93
Ovde je kao na porodiljskom odeljenju,[br]mislila sam da moraš znati šta se dešava.

00:26:50.98,00:26:52.25
- Da, znam.[br]- Odlièno.

00:26:52.30,00:26:54.29
- Mogu li sad da idem?[br]- Ne, jer...

00:26:54.34,00:26:57.17
mi ljudi smo drugaèiji od životinja.

00:26:58.02,00:26:59.42
Mi...

00:27:02.26,00:27:05.17
Er, pa, možda...mi previše razmišljamo.

00:27:05.22,00:27:06.94
I, erm...

00:27:06.98,00:27:09.97
I otkriæeš da je ponekad život,

00:27:10.02,00:27:11.93
tvoj život takoðe,

00:27:11.98,00:27:14.25
bolan.

00:27:14.30,00:27:15.94
Naroèito kad je reè...

00:27:19.22,00:27:20.37
o ljubavi.

00:27:21.82,00:27:26.05
Pa, pogledaj Džordža. Toliko je razoèaran[br]zbog Margo da je otišao nazad u Englesku.

00:27:26.10,00:27:28.37
Zašto nije potražio nekog drugog ovde?

00:27:30.18,00:27:32.33
Pa, zato što se oseæa...

00:27:32.38,00:27:34.21
beznadežno i...

00:27:34.26,00:27:37.17
usamljeno i...treba mu njegova porodica...

00:27:37.22,00:27:40.53
Neki jako doteran èovek[br]dolazi stazom.

00:27:41.86,00:27:43.13
Bože.

00:27:43.90,00:27:45.70
zar veæ?

00:27:45.74,00:27:47.70
Stigao je.

00:27:50.18,00:27:52.85
Margo nam je prièala toliko o Vama.

00:28:18.62,00:28:20.77
Volimo Margo.

00:28:20.82,00:28:22.65
Uzmite kolaè.

00:28:34.46,00:28:37.37
- Vi pišete, zar ne.[br]- Da, ja, er...

00:28:37.42,00:28:39.54
Uvek oseæam da bih mogao fantastièno da pišem kad bih probao.

00:28:39.58,00:28:43.89
Stvarno? Pa, to je dar, zar ne?

00:28:43.94,00:28:47.38
On odlièno pliva. Ide jako daleko od obale.

00:28:47.42,00:28:49.61
Možda bi voleo da nam pokaže.

00:28:52.06,00:28:53.70
Ja sam odlièan plivaè.

00:28:53.74,00:28:55.14
Ne znam za strah.

00:28:56.14,00:29:00.26
Kada jašem konja,[br]ne oseæam strah jer jašem savršeno.

00:29:01.26,00:29:03.30
Mogu da plovim brodom kroz oluju.

00:29:03.34,00:29:04.90
Bez straha.

00:29:06.66,00:29:07.77
Vidite,

00:29:07.82,00:29:10.29
ja nisam plašljiv èovek.

00:29:10.34,00:29:12.49
Volela bih kad ne bi stavljao toliko parfema.

00:29:18.18,00:29:19.82
Ahil...

00:29:19.86,00:29:21.58
Upao je u bunar.

00:29:22.38,00:29:25.50
Mislim da je mrtav.[br]- Oh.

00:29:32.74,00:29:34.70
On je kornjaèa.

00:29:36.54,00:29:37.69
Ah.

00:30:31.62,00:30:33.21
Šta su one?

00:30:33.26,00:30:34.58
Rakljaèe.

00:30:34.62,00:30:35.73
Predivno.

00:30:35.78,00:30:39.33
Ponekad znam zašto[br]više voliš životinje nego ljude.

00:30:41.34,00:30:43.41
Zašto te toliko zanimaju?

00:30:43.46,00:30:45.45
One su kao mi, zar ne?

00:30:45.50,00:30:46.57
Porodice.

00:30:46.62,00:30:48.50
Hoæu da znam kako funkcionišu.

00:30:49.50,00:30:51.30
Zamisli da nisu tamo.

00:30:51.34,00:30:54.65
- Mora li da ih drži na konèiæima?[br]- Bolje nego u kutiji.

00:30:55.94,00:30:58.45
Hajde da ih kupimo sve.

00:31:01.98,00:31:04.57
Danima, vila je bila puna rakljaèa,

00:31:04.62,00:31:07.53
koje su nam, kao smaragdi, padale u krila.

00:31:15.46,00:31:17.73
Pozvao sam par ljudi[br]na nedelju dana.

00:31:17.78,00:31:19.42
- Oh, that will be nice.[br]- Yeah.

00:31:19.46,00:31:22.69
It will be good to have[br]some intelligent and stimulating company.

00:31:22.74,00:31:27.34
- Oh, I hope they're not too highbrow.[br]- Of course they're not. They are charming.

00:31:27.38,00:31:28.78
Like me.

00:31:45.38,00:31:47.26
Little English lord.

00:31:48.10,00:31:51.69
- Why do they think we are lords and ladies?[br]- Because we act like it.

00:31:51.74,00:31:53.97
Tell the Pension Suisse your friends are coming.

00:31:54.02,00:31:56.09
No, no. I invited them to stay with us.

00:31:56.14,00:31:58.94
- How can they possibly stay with us?[br]- There's plenty of room.

00:31:58.98,00:32:01.17
- If Margo and Les sleep on the balcony.[br]- What?

00:32:01.22,00:32:04.42
- That gives you two rooms.[br]- You have to write and put them off.

00:32:04.46,00:32:05.89
I can't. They're on their way.

00:32:05.94,00:32:10.69
Oh, really, you are so thoughtless.[br]Where are they going to sleep?

00:32:11.70,00:32:13.89
We'll move into a bigger villa.

00:32:13.94,00:32:15.93
We can't afford it. Are you simple?

00:32:15.98,00:32:19.18
It's important to live beyond your means,[br]or banks don't respect you.

00:32:19.22,00:32:22.61
- How many people have you really invited?[br]- Eight.

00:32:24.26,00:32:25.77
To...twelve.

00:32:27.26,00:32:29.69
Well, we are not moving to another villa.

00:32:43.14,00:32:46.13
Mother went about settling us in again.

00:32:47.46,00:32:51.37
Our neat little house in Bournemouth[br]seemed several lifetimes away.

00:33:07.02,00:33:08.74
Inside of...

00:33:08.78,00:33:11.13
Ah, Mrs Durrells. This is Lugaretzia.

00:33:11.18,00:33:13.17
She, er, she comes with the house.

00:33:48.42,00:33:50.41
She has a bad stomach.

00:34:02.34,00:34:04.61
- Very odd.[br]- Well, I'll just...

00:34:15.06,00:34:16.73
Oh.

00:34:19.50,00:34:21.22
I'm going to kill her.

00:34:21.26,00:34:22.93
Put her out of her misery.

00:34:22.98,00:34:26.49
Poor woman. She's obviously suffering. What's the matter?

00:34:26.54,00:34:29.93
- Digestion. She gets these nasty...[br]- Don't tell us.

00:34:29.98,00:34:34.58
It's her feet now, apparently. Don't say anything,[br]there's no one else available.

00:34:35.70,00:34:37.69
Yummy, yummy.

00:34:38.58,00:34:40.73
I told you it was a good idea to move.

00:34:43.98,00:34:46.81
The furniture could be[br]a little more sturdy, perhaps.

00:35:11.66,00:35:15.25
Did I ever tell you about the last opera[br]we had in Corfu?

00:35:15.30,00:35:17.02
Er, no.

00:35:17.66,00:35:19.70
Oh.

00:35:20.26,00:35:25.13
Yes, it was one of those[br]travelling opera companies performing Tosca

00:35:25.18,00:35:27.82
with a leading lady who was very, er...

00:35:27.86,00:35:29.26
well developed.

00:35:29.30,00:35:33.42
Now, in the final act, as you probably know,[br]she throws herself to her death

00:35:33.46,00:35:35.45
from the battlements of a castle.

00:35:35.50,00:35:37.06
Well, on the first night,

00:35:37.10,00:35:40.93
it seems the stagehands had forgotten[br]to put anything for her to land on,

00:35:40.98,00:35:43.54
so she fell with a huge crash,

00:35:43.58,00:35:46.57
and then proceeded groaning quite loudly,

00:35:46.62,00:35:51.49
while her lover was singing about[br]how sad he was that she was dead.

00:35:53.22,00:35:55.69
- Oh.[br]- Shall we help him back on?

00:35:55.74,00:35:58.33
- No, I think that might put him off.[br]

00:35:58.38,00:36:01.85
The lady was, er, very, very upset,[br]understandably,

00:36:01.90,00:36:04.78
so the next night, the stagehands made sure

00:36:04.82,00:36:08.78
that they put a huge pile of mattresses[br]for her to land on.

00:36:08.82,00:36:12.86
But her landing was now so soft and springy,

00:36:12.90,00:36:17.18
that when the whole cast was singing away[br]about her tragic death,

00:36:17.22,00:36:20.21
she, the lady in question, reappeared,

00:36:20.26,00:36:22.49
two or three times above the battlements.

00:36:22.54,00:36:24.85
- Do you make these up?[br]- No.

00:36:24.90,00:36:28.10
- Nothing ever goes according to plan in Corfu.[br]

00:36:30.62,00:36:32.21
Larry's friends.

00:36:32.26,00:36:34.82
- I think Mother's a bit worried about them.[br]- Why?

00:36:34.86,00:36:37.98
Not bad, eh? Bleeding enormous.

00:36:52.46,00:36:54.45
A little bit quicker with that.

00:36:59.46,00:37:01.10
When is lunch?

00:37:03.86,00:37:05.85
Yes, it won't be long.

00:37:07.90,00:37:09.30
Oh!

00:37:12.38,00:37:14.50
Look. A tortoise.

00:37:14.54,00:37:17.29
- I watched it hatching.[br]- Oh, another tortoise. Splendid.

00:37:17.34,00:37:20.54
Please go and find Larry.[br]His friends are driving me mad.

00:37:24.54,00:37:25.94
Larry!

00:37:31.86,00:37:36.17
After weeks of searching,[br]I - I found the perfect trees covered...

00:37:37.18,00:37:39.25
in exquisite blossom.

00:37:39.30,00:37:41.29
I started to paint...

00:37:42.90,00:37:44.54
a masterpiece.

00:37:44.58,00:37:46.93
When I returned the next day...

00:37:48.14,00:37:51.81
I found all the blossom had fallen to the ground.

00:37:51.86,00:37:55.49
- That's the wind for you.[br]- I swore I'd never paint again.

00:37:55.54,00:37:57.21
But slowly...

00:37:57.26,00:37:59.73
I am recovering my nerves.

00:37:59.78,00:38:00.97
And...

00:38:01.02,00:38:03.37
And sometime...

00:38:03.42,00:38:05.81
I will start to paint again.

00:38:10.94,00:38:12.01
Larry!

00:38:14.38,00:38:16.42
Out you go, kid. I'm working.

00:38:22.66,00:38:24.65
Hommm.

00:38:25.62,00:38:26.65
Hommm.

00:38:26.70,00:38:30.74
Far from being the ordinary, charming people[br]that Larry had promised,

00:38:30.78,00:38:34.37
his friends turned out to be[br]the most extraordinary eccentrics.

00:38:34.42,00:38:37.73
It was like observing a whole new species.

00:38:40.86,00:38:42.26
Ha, ha.

00:39:10.34,00:39:13.57
Larry's too busy mating with Nancy.

00:39:16.94,00:39:18.82
Of course there's going to be a war.

00:39:18.86,00:39:22.49
That's what dictators do when they're bored[br]with oppressing their own people.

00:39:22.54,00:39:25.66
Is Hitler a dictator? I thought he was a painter.

00:39:25.70,00:39:27.61
So he can't be all bad.

00:39:27.66,00:39:29.85
- Painter and decorator.[br]- Oh.

00:39:29.90,00:39:31.89
Europe is a like a big, fat marrow,

00:39:31.94,00:39:34.29
lying in the sun, panting to explode.

00:39:34.34,00:39:37.81
Do you bloody poets not make sense[br]on purpose? I mean, what was that?

00:39:37.86,00:39:41.17
At least the Italian fascists[br]are spending their money on nice uniforms.

00:39:41.22,00:39:43.34
Germany's become a bomb-making factory.

00:39:43.38,00:39:47.17
No, that's just to give everybody[br]something to do. It's all about business.

00:39:47.22,00:39:49.13
You know nothing. You're Humpty Dumpty.

00:39:49.18,00:39:51.17
Ah. Humpty Dumpty. Now thank you.

00:39:51.22,00:39:56.50
At last, real poetry. Simple, free of clichés,[br]you could learn from it.

00:39:56.54,00:39:59.05
Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall

00:39:59.10,00:40:01.61
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall

00:40:01.66,00:40:03.93
Now, I mean, that could clearly be about Hitler.

00:40:03.98,00:40:06.49
Humpty as Hitler? I don't think that's right.

00:40:06.54,00:40:11.29
I think the more accurate analogy[br]there might be some... Hickory Dickory Dock.

00:40:11.34,00:40:14.65
- Well, if you're going to do mice...[br]- Come on, Larry.

00:40:14.70,00:40:17.09
It's not like you not to have an opinion.

00:40:17.14,00:40:19.05
No, it's not.

00:40:19.10,00:40:21.29
We're cut off from the world here.

00:40:21.34,00:40:25.57
I suppose we've grown rather fond of[br]our glorious isolation.

00:40:25.62,00:40:28.69
Actually, Larry thinks[br]the world's cut off from him,

00:40:28.74,00:40:32.02
- rather than the other way round.[br]- I do now you mention it. Yes, I do.

00:40:32.06,00:40:36.10
Fine. But you may wake up and find[br]there's no England to go back to.

00:40:36.14,00:40:38.73
Oh, I'm... I'm sure common sense will prevail.

00:40:38.78,00:40:42.17
Why? It never does in this family.

00:40:42.22,00:40:45.21
You'll find that Hickory Dickory Dock

00:40:45.26,00:40:48.46
is the mouse is going up the clock,[br]that's us being...

00:40:48.94,00:40:53.17
- The mouse being England, used to be...[br]- Could you just spit it out?

00:40:53.22,00:40:55.49
..now reduced to little mouse.

00:40:56.26,00:40:59.89
Tricking its way up the top[br]and that's us being chased.

00:41:02.02,00:41:03.85
Oh, God! It's her asthma.

00:41:04.86,00:41:07.90
- She's allergic to cats.[br]- That's the only animal we haven't got.

00:41:09.18,00:41:11.53
I'll open the windows.

00:41:11.58,00:41:15.02
Please, don't - don't open the window.[br]I'm allergic to fresh air.

00:41:17.62,00:41:20.18
Could it be bats?[br]I think we've got some of those.

00:41:20.22,00:41:22.05
- How could it be bats?[br]- I don't know.

00:41:22.10,00:41:24.33
Just breathe. God.

00:41:24.38,00:41:26.57
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

00:41:26.62,00:41:28.45
Just breathe.

00:41:36.34,00:41:38.85
Gerry, you're starting to look like a wild animal.

00:41:38.90,00:41:40.54
Thanks.

00:41:40.58,00:41:42.54
Have you ever stuffed a bat?

00:41:42.58,00:41:44.06
No.

00:41:44.10,00:41:46.09
It's harder than it looks.

00:41:46.90,00:41:48.89
If this works, I'm going to do Larry.

00:41:50.18,00:41:52.49
Isn't it enough just to look at them in the wild?

00:41:52.54,00:41:54.85
I like having them around me,

00:41:54.90,00:41:56.70
making noises,

00:41:56.74,00:41:57.97
smelling.

00:41:58.02,00:42:00.14
You're right. It's just like a family.

00:42:02.50,00:42:06.09
Did you hear the others talking about[br]what's happening in Germany?

00:42:07.82,00:42:09.22
Yes.

00:42:13.50,00:42:15.49
It seems so safe here.

00:42:47.38,00:42:50.66
No, barn owl! Barn owl, no!

00:42:50.70,00:42:52.42
No!

00:42:55.90,00:42:58.33
- Morning.[br]- Morning.

00:43:08.66,00:43:11.62
- What's he doing?[br]- The usual.

00:43:11.66,00:43:14.49
He was doing it at 2am[br]this morning with a torch.

00:43:14.54,00:43:17.58
He says the day shift[br]is totally unlike the night shift.

00:43:17.62,00:43:21.41
Just to warn you, the wild and the woolly[br]are stirring indoors,

00:43:21.46,00:43:23.85
and I don't mean Gerry's animals.

00:43:23.90,00:43:28.02
Larry, you might encourage your friend Mr Miller[br]to experiment with pyjamas.

00:43:28.06,00:43:31.81
Henry sees clothes[br]as the last refuge of the bourgeoisie.

00:43:35.98,00:43:38.86
Watch this. Three, two...

00:43:44.10,00:43:45.53
- Good.

00:43:45.58,00:43:49.25
Perhaps it's just as well your father didn't live[br]to see how you all turned out.

00:43:50.26,00:43:54.09
How extraordinarily insensitive of you.[br]I think you nagged him to death.

00:43:54.14,00:43:56.18
We're actually rather well adjusted.

00:43:57.58,00:43:58.98
Well, I am.

00:43:59.02,00:44:00.66
Oh.

00:44:00.70,00:44:04.58
I think I may have over-celebrated[br]the god of wine last night.

00:44:04.62,00:44:05.94
Erm...

00:44:06.66,00:44:07.73
Larry.

00:44:09.62,00:44:10.89
Don't move.

00:44:14.62,00:44:17.34
- Bloody hell![br]

00:44:19.82,00:44:22.01
What are you doing?

00:44:22.06,00:44:24.81
It's that boy.[br]Every matchbox in this house is a deathtrap.

00:44:24.86,00:44:27.01
Mother, they're coming. Quick, do something!

00:44:27.06,00:44:30.65
- How did those scorpions get on the table?[br]- No, no!

00:44:30.70,00:44:32.82
- Margo, where are they?

00:44:32.86,00:44:35.25
- Put the chair down, Leslie.[br]- Hit them with a book.

00:44:35.30,00:44:37.05
No! No!

00:44:39.34,00:44:41.33
No!

00:44:43.46,00:44:44.94
Hit them with a book!

00:44:44.98,00:44:47.70
Scorpions won't hurt you[br]unless you're clumsy with them.

00:44:47.74,00:44:52.21
They kill people, you idiot. They sting you,[br]it's excruciating, and then you die.

00:44:52.26,00:44:54.09
What on earth is going on?

00:44:54.14,00:44:55.97
Oh, my God, it's scorpions.

00:44:57.42,00:44:59.25
Oh, God.

00:44:59.30,00:45:01.61
- Breathe slowly.[br]- Don't have an attack.

00:45:01.66,00:45:04.38
I got a nosebleed.[br]It feels like I've got a nosebleed.

00:45:04.42,00:45:07.57
- Gerry. - Look, it's fine.

00:45:07.62,00:45:11.61
No! No, he's out of control.[br]He's driven my friends away.

00:45:11.66,00:45:13.93
I know. That's such a shame.

00:45:15.50,00:45:17.09
Well, what should I do?

00:45:17.14,00:45:20.29
Post him back to England in a big package[br]with his head sticking out?

00:45:20.34,00:45:23.14
- Don't be ridiculous.[br]- Don't tell me what to be.

00:45:23.18,00:45:24.82
You're my child, not my husband.

00:45:24.86,00:45:28.82
You are not driving this...[br]slightly ramshackle vehicle.

00:45:28.86,00:45:30.77
You're in the back, being driven.

00:45:31.62,00:45:33.77
Eating chocolates.

00:45:33.82,00:45:35.78
Well, I think it's about to crash.

00:45:35.82,00:45:37.54
Well, we'll see, shall we?

00:45:51.82,00:45:53.54
Gerald.

00:45:53.58,00:45:55.01
This is Peter.

00:45:55.82,00:45:58.38
- Hello, Gerald.[br]- Hello.

00:46:00.26,00:46:04.38
All right, thank you, Mrs Durrell.[br]I'm sure Gerald and I will be just fine.

00:46:20.58,00:46:22.57
Right.

00:46:24.14,00:46:25.94
Good.

00:46:26.98,00:46:28.81
Let me tell you something about me.

00:46:28.86,00:46:31.17
I believe in the building blocks of education.

00:46:31.22,00:46:35.66
There are no short cuts, there is only repetition,[br]rule learning and hard work.

00:46:37.10,00:46:39.98
Let's start with some basic...

00:46:40.02,00:46:41.61
mathematics.

00:46:48.30,00:46:50.69
Page one, number one.

00:47:08.06,00:47:11.34
When you've done that, move on to page 83,[br]work through those.

00:47:19.34,00:47:21.33
Hello, I'm Margo.

00:47:24.62,00:47:27.53
What a pleasant surprise.

00:47:31.06,00:47:35.02
I'd offer to teach you too, only you look like[br]you know everything already.

00:47:37.94,00:47:39.93
- Can I have a biscuit?[br]- No.

00:47:39.98,00:47:43.73
- Do call out if you need anything.[br]- I might just do that.

00:48:02.02,00:48:03.69
I say.

00:48:08.06,00:48:10.45
She loves being in the garden.

00:48:10.50,00:48:13.09
- Does she?[br]- Mm.

00:48:13.14,00:48:14.25
Chatting.

00:48:16.66,00:48:18.65
Shall I write a story?

00:48:20.10,00:48:21.53
A long story?

00:48:27.70,00:48:29.42
Good idea.

00:48:31.18,00:48:33.49
''Larry wrestled with the jaguar,

00:48:33.54,00:48:35.45
''the animal's incisors...

00:48:36.50,00:48:41.73
''inches from the tall, fleshy man's[br]soft, girlish skin.

00:48:42.70,00:48:44.89
''Larry glanced over to desperately see

00:48:44.94,00:48:50.81
''his brother Gerald having rather more success[br]tackling the massive boa constrictor

00:48:50.86,00:48:54.33
''wrapped round his mother's waist[br]like a rope of iron.

00:48:55.10,00:48:58.73
''He tore at the creature with a knife,[br]careful not to hurt it.

00:48:58.78,00:49:02.98
''Gerald finally sent the constrictor packing,[br]then turned to his older brother,

00:49:03.02,00:49:06.22
''who was whimpering with fear,[br]cornered by the jaguar.''

00:49:06.26,00:49:10.97
Gerry, your stuffed bat smells even worse[br]than everything else, if that were possible.

00:49:11.02,00:49:13.01
Please get rid of it.

00:49:13.06,00:49:15.78
- Where's Peter?[br]- He set me some work.

00:49:15.82,00:49:17.46
I'm working very hard.

00:49:18.46,00:49:20.73
I think he might be somewhere with Margo.

00:49:30.94,00:49:33.98
You can see that this essentially loamy soil

00:49:34.02,00:49:35.58
gives way...

00:49:36.78,00:49:40.37
..gives way further up the scarp,[br]to a more clay strata

00:49:40.42,00:49:44.46
- with the characteristic alluvium.[br]- Mm-hm.

00:49:49.86,00:49:52.66
There are publications on the subject[br]if you're interested.

00:49:52.70,00:49:56.82
Baldwin's Dictionary Of Soil[br]gives all types from A to Z,

00:49:56.86,00:49:59.77
and all letters in between.

00:50:01.62,00:50:03.53
Oh, Larry.

00:50:03.58,00:50:05.46
Oh!

00:50:05.50,00:50:07.49
I've grabbed it. I've got it.

00:50:12.34,00:50:15.06
They never let me win.

00:50:15.10,00:50:17.17
Forward. Forward with the Light Brigade.

00:50:17.22,00:50:18.33
Hey!

00:50:19.62,00:50:20.94
Oh!

00:50:20.98,00:50:24.37
- Does this remind you of Bournemouth?[br]- Not really, Les, no.

00:50:25.38,00:50:26.86
Was that a porpoise?

00:50:26.90,00:50:29.57
You should buy a costume and come in, Mum.

00:50:29.62,00:50:31.81
Ooh, no. Not at my age.

00:50:31.86,00:50:35.74
We get all the fun we need from sitting down[br]with a ball of knobbly wool.

00:50:35.78,00:50:37.58
Oh, don't be a wimp.

00:50:38.70,00:50:40.69
Whoa. Whoa.

00:50:53.06,00:50:55.21
When's Margo coming back?

00:50:55.26,00:50:57.45
Dunno. Mother took her shopping.

00:50:58.90,00:51:00.89
How do you spell scimitar?

00:51:04.46,00:51:08.05
You don't expect me to read that drivel[br]when you've finished it.

00:51:18.18,00:51:22.49
All right. Stop scribbling. By tomorrow[br]I want you to have written out all your tables.

00:51:22.54,00:51:23.61
Eight times.

00:51:25.70,00:51:28.61
I'll tell Mummy and big bro you won't work.

00:51:28.66,00:51:33.53
They'll have you off to that boarding school in[br]Surrey they've no doubt got lined up for you.

00:51:37.66,00:51:39.93
- Where's your annoying friend?[br]- Gone.

00:51:40.74,00:51:43.54
- You're not still writing that novel?[br]- No.

00:51:43.58,00:51:45.65
- Birthday list.[br]- Thank God.

00:51:45.70,00:51:48.90
Two obsessive writers in the family,[br]that's all we need.

00:51:49.78,00:51:52.34
What do you want, then?

00:51:53.58,00:51:55.62
I've done a list for each person.

00:51:56.94,00:51:58.93
And here's yours.

00:52:01.10,00:52:04.01
- A boat.[br]- I'm not allowed to use the Sea Cow.

00:52:04.06,00:52:07.05
- You could make me one.[br]- Do you know how much time that would take?

00:52:07.10,00:52:09.09
You know so much about boats.

00:52:09.14,00:52:10.54
Oh.

00:52:10.58,00:52:11.98
All right.

00:52:12.02,00:52:14.06
You should have a birthday party, Gerry.

00:52:14.10,00:52:17.69
Small but distinguished gathering,[br]ten people you like best.

00:52:17.74,00:52:21.29
- Thank you, Larry.[br]- Pleasure. I'll get Mother to arrange it.

00:52:33.06,00:52:37.45
Not only I, but each family member[br]invited ten people to the party.

00:52:38.22,00:52:41.13
Unfortunately, we didn't all invite the same ten.

00:52:41.18,00:52:44.49
The result was that Mother,[br]on the eve of the party,

00:52:44.54,00:52:48.25
suddenly discovered[br]we were going to have not ten guests, but 50.

00:52:51.46,00:52:55.98
Larry suggested the puppies be called[br]Widdle and Puke, and the names stuck.

00:53:09.38,00:53:11.61
Hello.

00:53:18.86,00:53:21.45
When we gots married, I asked my wife,

00:53:21.50,00:53:23.97
''How many childrens you want?''[br]She says two.

00:53:24.02,00:53:26.01
I gives her two, vadoom, vadoom.

00:53:26.06,00:53:28.33
Then I gets her sewed up.

00:53:28.38,00:53:30.18
Uh?

00:53:31.66,00:53:33.65
13 years old, uh?

00:53:33.70,00:53:35.69
Who would believe it?

00:53:42.62,00:53:43.73
Right!

00:55:36.14,00:55:37.70
Can we get this over with?

00:55:46.82,00:55:49.49
- He doesn't like it.[br]- I do, I love it.

00:55:50.58,00:55:53.25
Get it into the water, so we can go back to bed.

00:55:53.30,00:55:57.13
- She needs a name before we can launch her.[br]- Jolly Roger. Can I go now?

00:55:57.18,00:55:59.17
No. Something more interesting.

00:55:59.22,00:56:01.02
Arbuckle?

00:56:02.66,00:56:03.81
Bootle.

00:56:04.78,00:56:07.37
- The Bumtrinket.[br]- Don't be rude, Larry.

00:56:14.54,00:56:17.90
I name this boat the Bootle Bumtrinket.

00:56:31.02,00:56:33.01
Told you the mast was too big.

00:56:35.54,00:56:37.53
He'll have to go, of course.

00:56:37.58,00:56:38.93
Yeah.

00:56:39.98,00:56:41.57
Who? Where?

00:56:41.62,00:56:42.77
Peter.

00:56:42.82,00:56:45.13
He and Margo are obviously...

00:56:45.18,00:56:47.37
becoming too fond of each other.

00:56:48.38,00:56:50.29
Look, I hardly want him as a relative,

00:56:50.34,00:56:52.69
- but you can't blame them for wanting to...[br]- Yes.

00:56:52.74,00:56:55.81
I don't want to hear your current word for it,[br]thank you.

00:56:59.22,00:57:01.21
I think it's too short now.

00:57:28.62,00:57:30.93
- This is so unfair.[br]- It's so unfair.

00:57:30.98,00:57:32.65
I love him.

00:57:32.70,00:57:34.53
You love him. I know.

00:57:34.58,00:57:36.73
Love is lovely.

00:57:36.78,00:57:38.50
But terrible.

00:57:38.54,00:57:41.90
There's no other work[br]for Peter here on the island.

00:57:41.94,00:57:44.37
He'll have to go back to Athens.

00:57:44.42,00:57:46.33
I'll shoot him if he tries to come back.

00:57:46.38,00:57:48.37
A little bit reactionary, perhaps.

00:57:48.42,00:57:50.81
You've got to be firm[br]under these circumstances.

00:57:50.86,00:57:53.21
Family honour is at stake.

00:57:57.06,00:58:01.10
I put the word out. They'll stop him[br]at the docks if he try to get back in.

00:58:01.14,00:58:04.73
I have nothing more to say to you,[br]so if I can show you out...

00:58:09.06,00:58:10.70
I hate you!

00:58:10.74,00:58:12.33
You've destroyed my life.

00:58:12.38,00:58:15.18
Margo, darling.[br]I would love you to find someone,

00:58:15.22,00:58:17.05
but I fear Peter was not the one.

00:58:17.10,00:58:19.98
- What do you know?[br]- I know how to protect my family.

00:58:20.02,00:58:22.53
- You do not![br]- Yes, I do!

00:58:23.30,00:58:26.97
I'm staying in my bedroom.[br]I don't want to see anyone.

00:58:33.98,00:58:36.62
Somebody's been pinching things[br]from the Sea Cow.

00:58:36.66,00:58:39.62
- Not on Corfu. Who?[br]- Fishermen, presumably.

00:58:41.54,00:58:43.81
- I'm worried about Margo.[br]- Mmm.

00:58:43.86,00:58:46.05
She's been in her room for nearly a week.

00:58:46.10,00:58:49.69
- She's never refused food before.[br]- I saw Gerry with a tray.

00:58:49.74,00:58:52.62
Well, yes, she takes it from him.

00:58:54.54,00:58:56.45
Perhaps Peter wouldn't have been so bad.

00:58:56.50,00:58:58.89
- He was appalling.[br]- Yes, he was, wasn't he?

00:58:58.94,00:59:01.77
He's threatened to come back[br]and snatch Margo away.

00:59:01.82,00:59:02.81
Apparently.

00:59:06.82,00:59:07.81
Aw.

00:59:09.66,00:59:11.85
How romantic.

00:59:26.34,00:59:27.82
What's happening?

00:59:27.86,00:59:30.82
Margo's done something silly. Where is she?

00:59:30.86,00:59:32.66
Margo!

00:59:34.06,00:59:37.10
Thank God. I thought[br]you'd done something terrible to yourself.

00:59:37.14,00:59:39.70
- Someone's shot Peter![br]- What's wrong?

00:59:39.74,00:59:41.81
Shut up till we know what's happening.

00:59:41.86,00:59:43.61
I need to check he's all right.

00:59:43.66,00:59:46.94
- Come on. Back in.[br]- Leave him alone, you cowards!

00:59:46.98,00:59:48.54
Burglars.

00:59:48.58,00:59:50.38
Where? Get the bloody dogs in.

00:59:50.42,00:59:53.09
- Everyone, shut up!

00:59:53.14,00:59:56.53
- I need to check if Peter's all right.[br]- What? I wasn't shooting at him!

00:59:57.38,00:59:59.37
It was my burglar warning device.

01:00:20.42,01:00:23.25
Did you expect nobody would hear?

01:00:23.30,01:00:26.45
I'm protecting the family's assets[br]from those fishermen.

01:00:26.50,01:00:28.85
In case they were out there.

01:00:29.66,01:00:32.17
I - I don't even have to get out of bed,[br]you see.

01:00:34.06,01:00:36.25
- Look. Shall I demonstrate?[br]- No!

01:00:36.74,01:00:38.54
No, you madman!

01:00:39.58,01:00:41.73
They're too far away to get badly hurt.

01:00:41.78,01:00:46.09
Animals and explosions all day, bloody great[br]12-gun salutes in the middle of the night.

01:00:46.14,01:00:49.81
There's eccentricity. And then there's stupidity!

01:01:14.50,01:01:16.89
Do you have to kill quite so many?

01:01:16.94,01:01:19.25
You said I was allowed to hunt.

01:01:19.30,01:01:22.53
- Poor innocent creatures.[br]- It's the hunting season.

01:01:22.58,01:01:24.49
They expect to be shot.

01:01:26.14,01:01:27.49
How is she?

01:01:27.54,01:01:29.93
Still sad. Reading poetry.

01:01:29.98,01:01:30.97
Who?

01:01:31.02,01:01:32.85
- Um... Tennyson.[br]- Ugh.

01:01:32.90,01:01:35.49
- How can we jolt her out of this?[br]- Don't expect me to help,

01:01:35.54,01:01:38.13
- I believe in free love.[br]- No, you don't, you silly boy.

01:01:38.18,01:01:42.57
Why doesn't she stop moping around, disguise[br]herself as a peasant and fly into Peter's arms?

01:01:45.98,01:01:49.37
Lugaretzia, that's horrible.[br]I'm so sorry that Roger bit you.

01:01:49.42,01:01:52.30
I'd no idea wild boar was so big.

01:01:52.34,01:01:55.17
- Do be careful.[br]- It's perfectly safe.

01:01:55.22,01:01:58.42
- Unless they charge. - You can always vault over it.

01:01:59.38,01:02:02.93
- Vault over a charging boar?[br]- Why not?

01:02:02.98,01:02:05.94
Well, do come with me today[br]to the marshes and demonstrate.

01:02:05.98,01:02:07.94
I don't profess to be a man of action, Les,

01:02:07.98,01:02:10.17
I supply the ideas,[br]it's your job to carry them out.

01:02:10.22,01:02:11.78
You always think the things

01:02:11.82,01:02:14.29
- other people do are simple.[br]- They are.

01:02:14.34,01:02:17.17
He's right. You never put your suggestions[br]into practice.

01:02:17.22,01:02:19.73
Yes. Are you ever going to actually do anything?

01:02:19.78,01:02:21.58
Fine.

01:02:22.98,01:02:25.41
My honour's at stake.

01:02:25.46,01:02:27.10
Prepare me a gun.

01:02:28.14,01:02:31.02
I'm going down to the beach. Don't follow me.

01:02:44.34,01:02:46.98
I didn't think it was going to be this...dank.

01:02:47.02,01:02:49.90
So, trickiest of all is[br]what's called the right and left,

01:02:49.94,01:02:54.93
where you make two kills in quick succession[br]first with the right, then the left barrel.

01:02:54.98,01:02:57.25
Sounds easy enough.

01:03:00.98,01:03:03.25
You might want to load it.

01:03:03.30,01:03:05.29
I know.

01:03:21.06,01:03:22.29
Agh!

01:03:26.02,01:03:28.61
Hold the gun above your head[br]and don't stand up,

01:03:28.66,01:03:30.65
or you'll sink. Stay how you are.

01:03:32.22,01:03:34.94
No. Now you've choked the bloody barrels!

01:03:34.98,01:03:37.25
- Would you rather I was sucked under?[br]- Yes!

01:03:37.30,01:03:39.49
Ooh. Ah.

01:03:40.86,01:03:42.85
- Get me out of here.[br]- Hold the gun out to me.

01:03:42.90,01:03:44.81
Forget the gun, save me!

01:03:44.86,01:03:47.33
I can't reach you unless you give me[br]the end of the gun.

01:03:52.06,01:03:54.62
Working, working, working, working.

01:03:58.62,01:04:00.53
- Oh.[br]- Oh!

01:04:00.58,01:04:02.22
I'm going down. I'm going under.

01:04:02.26,01:04:05.97
I'm going under.[br]It's Shelley, it's Shelley all over again.

01:04:06.02,01:04:07.82
Ooh. Ooh.

01:04:07.86,01:04:09.53
Take it.

01:04:09.58,01:04:10.90
Oh, God!

01:04:12.50,01:04:14.46
Come on.

01:04:20.10,01:04:22.17
- Ow![br]- Oh.

01:04:27.58,01:04:28.81
All right?

01:04:28.86,01:04:30.61
Oh, yes.

01:04:30.66,01:04:32.93
- Having a wonderful time.[br]- Good.

01:04:32.98,01:04:34.81
And on with the hunting.

01:05:04.22,01:05:07.21
I don't know what I'll do, Lugaretzia,[br]if Germany...

01:05:13.58,01:05:15.65
You want to gather all your children.

01:05:18.78,01:05:21.85
Gather them up and shout at everyone else[br]to keep away.

01:05:25.94,01:05:27.93
Makes you very selfish.

01:05:39.78,01:05:41.18
How did that go?

01:05:41.22,01:05:42.37
Oh.

01:05:42.42,01:05:44.41
I should ask Larry.

01:05:53.86,01:05:55.85
Don't say a word.

01:06:00.34,01:06:02.33
Was that fun?

01:06:02.38,01:06:04.42
You seem to be missing a shoe.

01:06:04.46,01:06:06.77
Did you fall in a bog?

01:06:12.26,01:06:14.73
It's rather windy out there.

01:06:31.22,01:06:34.66
Margo, dear, I sometimes wonder[br]if you're quite right.

01:06:34.70,01:06:36.69
Oh, leave me alone.

01:06:38.74,01:06:40.73
Are you back with us now?

01:06:44.50,01:06:45.93
Do I look...

01:06:45.98,01:06:47.89
windswept and interesting at all?

01:06:47.94,01:06:49.93
No, dear.

01:06:54.34,01:06:56.33
Larry's really hitting the brandy.

01:06:56.38,01:06:59.45
- Well, he's in shock, the poor boy.[br]- Mm.

01:06:59.50,01:07:03.49
# Greensleeves was all my joy... #

01:07:05.18,01:07:08.69
- No, not the singing.[br]- # ..my delight #

01:07:16.50,01:07:18.49
Larry.

01:07:21.78,01:07:25.57
Now, come on. Stop being a fool[br]and drink this down at once.

01:07:25.62,01:07:27.74
You're a horrible old woman.

01:07:27.78,01:07:30.50
I'm sure I've seen you somewhere before.

01:07:30.54,01:07:32.29
- Yes, well.[br]

01:07:32.34,01:07:34.33
I'll put that down to the drink.

01:07:40.10,01:07:43.30
Not that you're so different when you're sober.

01:07:50.74,01:07:52.73
- Morning.[br]- Mm.

01:08:05.22,01:08:06.78
Fire.

01:08:06.82,01:08:08.94
- Fire![br]- Fire!

01:08:08.98,01:08:12.94
- Fire! Fire![br]- Wake up. The house is on fire!

01:08:17.86,01:08:19.85
What's going on?

01:08:19.90,01:08:22.49
- It's not me this time.[br]- Larry's on fire!

01:08:26.50,01:08:27.49
Larry.

01:08:28.42,01:08:30.93
Larry! For heaven's sake, wake up!

01:08:31.70,01:08:33.58
Wake up!

01:08:33.62,01:08:35.21
The room's on fire!

01:08:35.26,01:08:37.69
You all put it out. I've got a bit of a headache.

01:08:38.90,01:08:40.49
Pour something on it.

01:08:41.74,01:08:43.78
- No, no, no! Not brandy, you...[br]

01:08:44.86,01:08:46.85
Please use it. I've had enough.

01:08:47.74,01:08:50.65
Why did he do that? Are you trying[br]to freeze me to death?

01:08:50.70,01:08:51.42
Oh, shut up!

01:08:56.10,01:08:59.54
Oh, this is nice. Look.[br]Organdie with puffed sleeves.

01:09:01.98,01:09:03.97
Henry's written a filthy book!

01:09:04.02,01:09:05.17
Excellent.

01:09:05.22,01:09:07.53
Oh, now that is...

01:09:07.58,01:09:10.38
Look at that. Telescopic sight.

01:09:10.42,01:09:14.21
- Bolt-action.[br]- Great Aunt Hermione wonders how you are.

01:09:14.94,01:09:17.25
Mother, I'm buying a chimpanzee.

01:09:17.30,01:09:19.02
- No, you're not.[br]

01:09:19.06,01:09:21.62
She claims doctors don't hold out[br]much hope for her.

01:09:21.66,01:09:24.46
- Have they ever?[br]- She was doubtful about us rushing to Corfu,

01:09:24.50,01:09:26.89
but after their winter,[br]she thinks it wasn't stupid.

01:09:26.94,01:09:28.93
- A chipmunk, then?[br]-No.

01:09:30.10,01:09:32.01
- Oh, Lord.[br]- What?

01:09:32.06,01:09:33.17
Oh, no.

01:09:34.54,01:09:37.45
The doctors have advised a warm climate.

01:09:37.50,01:09:39.65
- She's coming to stay.[br]- No!

01:09:39.70,01:09:42.90
It's grim enough being shown[br]Lugaretzia's latest suppurating wound,

01:09:42.94,01:09:45.45
without having a great aunt[br]dying all over the place.

01:09:45.50,01:09:47.97
- Write and tell her there's no room.[br]- I can't.

01:09:48.02,01:09:50.74
- I told her what a big villa we have.[br]- I've got it.

01:09:50.78,01:09:53.74
I've got it. I'll write to her[br]and tell her that you've died.

01:09:53.78,01:09:55.77
- Larry![br]- Larry!

01:09:56.66,01:09:58.97
Fine. We'll move to a smaller villa,

01:09:59.02,01:10:02.41
which will also force jungle boy[br]to get rid of some of his bloody animals.

01:10:02.46,01:10:05.53
- They're less trouble than your silly friends.[br]- Oh, yes?

01:10:05.58,01:10:08.14
You're an animal too. Let's get rid of you first.

01:10:08.18,01:10:10.77
It is too big, this house.

01:10:10.82,01:10:12.57
The stairs are really tiring.

01:10:12.62,01:10:15.58
Children. We are not moving again.

01:10:40.74,01:10:43.94
We moved in and the bats[br]that were living there moved out.

01:10:43.98,01:10:46.29
As Margot said, typically,

01:10:46.34,01:10:49.06
''A change is as good as a feast. ''

01:11:50.94,01:11:54.49
I'm sorry we didn't believe you[br]when you said you got seasick, Spiro, dear.

01:11:54.54,01:11:56.53
Will you survive?

01:11:59.70,01:12:02.01
- Excuse me.

01:12:02.62,01:12:04.34
Hello. Stop.

01:12:04.38,01:12:05.37
I - I think...

01:12:14.66,01:12:16.85
How you doing, Spiro?

01:12:16.90,01:12:18.54
Feeling better?

01:12:19.82,01:12:20.93
Yeah.

01:12:25.42,01:12:27.41
Perhaps we should have come by car.

01:12:44.30,01:12:46.53
I adore this place.

01:12:47.54,01:12:48.97
Look away, Margo, dear.

01:12:50.10,01:12:51.09
- Theo.[br]- Hm?

01:12:51.78,01:12:53.97
- Are you all right?[br]- No, I'm fine.

01:12:54.02,01:12:56.01
Yes. No, I'm very good.

01:12:56.06,01:12:58.25
Look at those gulls flying over.

01:12:58.30,01:12:59.94
Yes. Yes.

01:12:59.98,01:13:02.25
All the nice gulls love a sailor.

01:13:04.02,01:13:06.82
Do you know, I should like to be buried here.

01:13:07.94,01:13:09.93
Oh, make up your mind.

01:13:13.38,01:13:17.45
I'm afraid I heard on the wireless yesterday[br]that Germany...

01:13:17.50,01:13:19.49
Shhh. Stop.

01:13:20.54,01:13:22.29
Let's not spoil it.

01:13:23.50,01:13:24.69
Oi!

01:13:24.74,01:13:26.73
Son of a bitch fish.

01:13:38.18,01:13:42.86
The magic of the island had settled over us[br]as gently and clingingly as pollen.

01:13:44.02,01:13:47.57
Each day had a tranquillity[br]and timelessness about it.

01:13:47.62,01:13:50.09
We wished that it would never end.

01:14:55.34,01:14:57.93
- Where have you been?[br]- How do you mean?

01:14:57.98,01:15:00.17
You've been gone for two days.

01:15:00.22,01:15:02.69
- You knew where I was.[br]- No. Where?

01:15:02.74,01:15:04.01
Out and about.

01:15:04.06,01:15:05.86
Please.

01:15:06.78,01:15:08.58
No more long trips.

01:15:10.18,01:15:12.77
How will you ever put on shoes again?

01:15:12.82,01:15:14.41
And be normal?

01:15:15.42,01:15:19.89
- Oh, do talk to me. You are not a wild animal.[br]- I've given up shoes.

01:15:19.94,01:15:22.98
Oh, you're back. What have you brought[br]this time, a woolly mammoth?

01:15:23.02,01:15:24.58
- Did you feed everyone?[br]- Yes.

01:15:24.62,01:15:26.45
More or less.

01:15:27.18,01:15:29.93
Oh, aren't they sweet?

01:15:29.98,01:15:32.41
Gerry, why do you bring all these animals back?

01:15:32.46,01:15:34.37
How revolting.

01:15:34.42,01:15:36.85
- Golly. What's them?[br]- Magpies.

01:15:36.90,01:15:41.26
Oh, maggenpies, huh?[br]What's you going to do with them bastards?

01:15:41.30,01:15:43.69
Magpies, Spiro, magpies.

01:15:43.74,01:15:45.22
Maggenpies.

01:15:45.26,01:15:47.65
These are maggenpies.

01:15:47.70,01:15:49.02
No.

01:15:49.06,01:15:50.70
Mag-pies.

01:15:50.74,01:15:52.49
Yeah. Maggenpies.

01:15:52.54,01:15:54.61
Maaag...

01:15:54.66,01:15:56.65
pies.

01:15:56.70,01:15:59.29
Maaaggenpies.

01:16:01.70,01:16:03.82
- What's he brought now?[br]- Maggenpies.

01:16:03.86,01:16:06.61
Awful thieves, maggenpies,[br]put them back where you found them.

01:16:06.66,01:16:10.33
I can't. Their mother won't take them.[br]I'll train them.

01:16:10.38,01:16:13.93
- It will be all right.[br]- I could easily shoot them if you'd like.

01:16:13.98,01:16:16.29
- No.[br]- No, thank you.

01:16:27.94,01:16:30.41
Come on, Mum. You know you want to.

01:16:30.46,01:16:32.69
No. I've changed my mind.

01:16:32.74,01:16:34.25
Too old.

01:16:34.30,01:16:37.53
- Haven't got a figure for swimming.[br]- Don't be ridiculous, woman.

01:16:38.82,01:16:41.70
Oh, come on. If not now, when?

01:16:42.82,01:16:44.81
I won't be here forever.

01:16:54.94,01:16:57.50
- Whoa. I'm gonna drown, I'm gonna drown.[br]

01:16:57.54,01:16:59.26
- All right?[br]- You can't wear that.

01:16:59.30,01:17:03.09
- It looks like it was made in 1920.[br]- It was all they had. Sorry.

01:17:03.14,01:17:04.97
I should have popped over to Paris.

01:17:05.02,01:17:07.61
- Mrs Durrell, you look splendid.[br]- Thank you.

01:17:07.66,01:17:10.81
Don't forget to shake the fish out[br]when you come out of the water.

01:17:10.86,01:17:13.77
Shut up! This is my moment[br]and I don't want you spoiling it.

01:17:13.82,01:17:16.81
- Going in, the creature is going in.[br]

01:17:16.86,01:17:17.93
All right.

01:17:18.82,01:17:20.81
- Ooh.

01:17:23.10,01:17:25.90
Ow! Look, get the dog off.

01:17:25.94,01:17:27.05
Oh!

01:17:27.10,01:17:29.49
Eat up, Roger.

01:17:29.54,01:17:31.77
Here. Mrs Durrell, give me your hand.

01:17:31.82,01:17:34.86
You're all right. You're all right.

01:17:34.90,01:17:36.97
Oh. Ooh. The bum monster.

01:17:37.02,01:17:38.77
That hasn't seen the sun for a long time.

01:17:38.82,01:17:40.81
Oh, my God.

01:17:41.54,01:17:44.05
Don't be embarrassed, I am a doctor.

01:17:44.10,01:17:46.69
Although I am off duty at the moment.

01:17:53.18,01:17:54.41
Gerry.

01:17:57.38,01:18:00.13
Stay back. Stay back.

01:18:00.18,01:18:02.22
OK. I...

01:18:03.50,01:18:08.02
- I'm the king of the ship.[br]- You should be proud of yourself.

01:18:08.06,01:18:09.73
Not so sure.

01:18:12.18,01:18:17.30
Who was it who said, ''If you can control your[br]family, you've gone terribly wrong somewhere''?

01:18:19.02,01:18:20.37
Aristotle?

01:18:20.42,01:18:22.01
No.

01:18:23.90,01:18:25.70
Was it me?

01:18:25.74,01:18:26.85
Yes.

01:18:32.74,01:18:36.10
My mother steered her vessel[br]full of strange progeny

01:18:36.14,01:18:39.50
through the stormy seas of life with great skill.

01:18:39.54,01:18:44.25
As Larry rightly pointed out, ''We can be[br]proud of the way we brought her up. ''

01:19:17.54,01:19:19.53
Oh, that sodding boy!

01:19:21.70,01:19:23.69
And that was that.

01:19:26.22,01:19:27.65
No.

01:19:27.70,01:19:30.34
I think you're old enough to sort yourselves out.

01:19:30.38,01:19:33.21
They've made an awful mess of your papers.

01:19:36.94,01:19:39.37
Those bloody birds!

01:19:40.78,01:19:43.82
No more wildlife!

01:19:43.86,01:19:44.89
Gerald!

01:19:44.94,01:19:46.34
Gerald!

01:20:04.30,01:20:05.37
Ah.

01:20:05.42,01:20:07.22
Here.

01:20:08.50,01:20:10.77
- Oh.

01:20:10.82,01:20:13.65
- Theo. What a pleasure.[br]- Theo.

01:20:17.38,01:20:19.85
I'm afraid I have some bad news, Mrs Durrell.

01:20:21.58,01:20:23.06
What's Gerry done?

01:20:23.10,01:20:25.09
No, nothing.

01:20:25.14,01:20:27.97
I think you should return to England[br]with your family.

01:20:28.02,01:20:30.01
Has Larry been annoying people again?

01:20:30.06,01:20:33.69
Britain and Greece[br]will shortly be engulfed by war.

01:20:33.74,01:20:38.42
If you leave it too late,[br]you'll have grave difficulties getting back.

01:20:40.38,01:20:42.34
Can't bear to tell Gerry.

01:20:57.98,01:21:00.02
Has Leslie finally shot someone?

01:21:00.06,01:21:02.05
We have to leave the island.

01:21:08.98,01:21:10.05
Right.

01:21:11.10,01:21:13.41
Bad luck, Theo.

01:21:13.46,01:21:15.85
You get Gerry's animals to look after.

01:21:15.90,01:21:17.38
Yes.

01:21:17.42,01:21:18.85
No, I will do it.

01:21:19.82,01:21:20.89
Theo.

01:21:25.54,01:21:27.53
So sorry, Gerry.

01:21:30.02,01:21:31.82
We have to go home.

01:22:05.14,01:22:07.13
- Agh!

01:22:08.82,01:22:10.01
Oh.

01:22:10.06,01:22:12.89
Oh, it feels like I say goodbye[br]to my own peoples.

01:22:14.18,01:22:15.98
I feels you belong to me.

01:22:16.02,01:22:18.01
I'm coming back, Spiro.

01:22:18.06,01:22:19.70
Honestly.

01:22:19.74,01:22:21.86
You come back, honest?

01:22:21.90,01:22:23.73
Goodbye.

01:22:23.78,01:22:25.05
Bye.

01:22:25.10,01:22:26.69
- Bye.[br]- Bye-bye, Margo.

01:22:26.74,01:22:28.49
I'll miss you.

01:22:30.66,01:22:32.14
Hey, hey, hey.

01:22:33.18,01:22:36.30
No more shootings for you now, huh?[br]There's a war on.

01:22:38.70,01:22:39.77
Oh.

01:22:49.90,01:22:52.62
I'm, er...actually staying, Spiro.

01:22:53.62,01:22:54.73
Sorry.

01:22:59.98,01:23:01.01
Boys.

01:23:02.22,01:23:04.29
- Goodbye, Lugaretzia.

01:23:05.06,01:23:07.37
And, er, good luck with all...

01:23:07.42,01:23:09.73
your illnesses.

01:23:28.38,01:23:31.85
Right. I've, er...scribbled down[br]some essential reading.

01:23:31.90,01:23:34.29
Nothing, you know, too arduous.

01:23:36.58,01:23:38.93
But I think...

01:23:40.78,01:23:43.93
the most important thing is, um...

01:23:46.54,01:23:47.53
Well...

01:24:10.86,01:24:12.93
I'm sorry. I don't mean to cry.

01:24:32.98,01:24:34.01
Theo!

01:24:34.06,01:24:37.18
Don't forget to feed Quasimodo.

01:24:37.22,01:24:41.01
And Spiro, you know Aleka likes fresh sardines.

01:24:41.06,01:24:44.05
- Don't worry.[br]- Everything's under control.

01:24:44.10,01:24:47.41
- What is Aleka?[br]- The huge, angry seagull.

01:24:47.46,01:24:49.77
You'll need some thick gloves. Good luck.

01:25:06.46,01:25:08.45
So when are we coming back?

01:25:10.26,01:25:12.25
Soon, Gerry, soon.

01:25:12.30,01:25:14.42
After you've had a bit of an education.

01:25:14.46,01:25:16.53
So what have I just had?

01:25:17.54,01:25:18.73
Erm...

01:25:18.78,01:25:20.58
Not sure.

01:25:26.38,01:25:28.37
So is it downhill from now on?

01:25:30.26,01:25:33.62
- Yes, I rather think it is.[br]- Shall I fire off a ceremonial ten-gun salute?

01:25:33.66,01:25:36.09
- No.[br]- Absolutely not.

01:25:37.50,01:25:40.78
You know what, Gerry?[br]They're all right, your stories.

01:25:40.82,01:25:42.81
Not terribly flattering...

01:25:43.86,01:25:45.90
but pretty good.

01:25:49.78,01:25:52.09
It was nice to be all together.

01:25:52.14,01:25:53.89
Yes, it was.

01:25:56.50,01:25:57.90
What a rude man.

01:25:57.94,01:25:59.90
What?

01:26:02.42,01:26:06.49
''Description of passengers:[br]one travelling circus and staff.''

01:26:07.82,01:26:09.81
An odd thing to write.

01:26:11.86,01:26:14.13
Some people really are peculiar.

01:26:42.34,01:26:45.49
Back in England,[br]Mother insisted I went to school,

01:26:45.54,01:26:49.09
despite my protestation[br]that I liked being half-educated.

01:26:50.46,01:26:54.34
You were so much more surprised at everything[br]when you were ignorant.
