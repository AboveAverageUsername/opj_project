00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:34,221
Mrs. Margaret.

3
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:38,650
- Oh, look at that pretty broach.
- Aren't you so kind?

4
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:41,534
You have yourself a lovely day,
Mr. Georgie Wits.

5
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:07,871
Remember when we promised we'd wait
till you graduated to get out of here?

6
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:09,384
Yeah.

7
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:11,408
You been out...

8
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:13,528
three years now.

9
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:17,414
But the situation changed.

10
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:19,449
Got your daddy to take care of.

11
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,216
Well...

12
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:23,920
I wish I could put him
in one of them homes.

13
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,159
That ain't true.

14
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:27,956
I wish I could put him into one of them homes
and just make my peace with him.

15
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,861
There's what... 3,000 people live here?

16
00:02:33,963 --> 00:02:38,067
I know 'em all. By face, at least.

17
00:02:38,668 --> 00:02:42,137
They smile at me, caring for my dad.

18
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:45,343
They'll turn on me in a heartbeat,
they find out I wanna bail.

19
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:48,346
Everybody's in everybody's business.

20
00:02:48,445 --> 00:02:51,449
Hey. Come on.

21
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:56,219
- You can be sad, Dwayne.
- I ain't sad.

22
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,387
I'm bothered.

23
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:14,472
Hey! Shit-heads.

24
00:03:14,572 --> 00:03:18,009
Can't you see there's a whole big field
there to throw your ball around on?

25
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:20,944
Yeah, but ain't you pervin' right now?

26
00:03:21,045 --> 00:03:23,512
Piss off, both of ya!

27
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,288
For me?

28
00:03:33,418 --> 00:03:34,490
Thank you, ma'am.

29
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:47,437
- Come on. Give it another go. Video's on.
- I'm not ready, Dwayne. I need a rehearsal.

30
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:49,528
There's no time for a rehearsal.
Sun's fallin'.

31
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,009
I feel stupid, Dwayne.

32
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:55,811
Well, you look like a starlet.

33
00:03:57,014 --> 00:04:01,009
- Really?
- Yeah. Just like Natalie Wood.

34
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,788
Think on it like it's just me and you
practicing in your room, okay?

35
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:05,990
I'll video the rehearsal.

36
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,455
Okay.

37
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:15,733
Hi! Welcome to Cut Bank, Montana,
where the Rockies meet the Plains.

38
00:04:15,832 --> 00:04:17,401
My name's Cassandra Steeley,

39
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:21,505
and I'd like to show you my town
full of cheer and wonted kindness.

40
00:04:21,605 --> 00:04:26,677
Here we're surrounded by miles
and miles of wheat and canola fields

41
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:28,879
and soaring mountains.

42
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,490
There's a Blackfoot Indian reservation
close by that gives us

43
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:33,817
rich cultural diversity.

44
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,252
- Cut Bank's a treasure from a bygone ti...
- Get down!

45
00:04:41,057 --> 00:04:42,994
Dwayne!

46
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:44,759
Stay down.

47
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,066
Oh, shit.

48
00:04:58,574 --> 00:05:00,310
<i>...soaring mountains.</i>

49
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:02,827
<i>There's a Blackfoot Indian reservation
close by that gives us</i>

50
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,848
<i>rich cultural diversity.</i>

51
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:07,084
<i>Cut Bank's a treasure
from a bygone ti...</i>

52
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:08,574
That ain't it. He shoots him again.

53
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:12,314
Imaginin' suits me.
Already more disappointin'

54
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:14,158
- than I'd like to think on.
- Dinner's ready!

55
00:05:14,257 --> 00:05:16,461
- We should call Sheriff Vogel.
- Like this instant.

56
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,696
- We can drive down to see him.
- Dinner's ready.

57
00:05:18,795 --> 00:05:21,819
All right. We're comin'.

58
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,268
Daddy, we just seen a manslaughter.

59
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:27,302
Go sit yourselves down to eat,
and I'll phone the sheriff.

60
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:31,108
- Thanks, Big Stan.
- Call me "sir."

61
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:34,345
And no mention of this
over the table, okay?

62
00:05:34,444 --> 00:05:37,112
You and me and the sheriff
will talk it over when he comes.

63
00:05:44,254 --> 00:05:46,442
- Big Stan.
- Roland.

64
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:51,528
Ought I insist once and again you call me
Sheriff Vogel? Or you old of the ear?

65
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:54,632
I see you're still fingerin'
that fairy furry thing.

66
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:57,367
'Bout time to let childhood
romances go, don't you think?

67
00:05:57,468 --> 00:06:01,939
It's just my key chain, Stan. You sure
you still ain't hangin' on to somethin'?

68
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:04,641
- Hiya, Sheriff Vogel.
- Evenin', Barb.

69
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:08,596
- Can I get you men some pie?
- Won't be necessary.

70
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:10,132
I'd appreciate some.

71
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:13,100
- Dwayne?
- Thank you, ma'am.

72
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:15,802
Mr. Dwayne McClaren. How are you, son?

73
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:18,839
- Okay, sir.
- How's your daddy?

74
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:21,553
Same pretty much, but he's okay.

75
00:06:22,908 --> 00:06:25,245
Ever tell you 'bout the time
that he saved me

76
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:29,783
from gettin' whooped by Fred
and George Little back in school?

77
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:33,718
Made me look like a champ
in front of Celine Towers.

78
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:39,625
Celine was very pretty.

79
00:06:43,896 --> 00:06:47,134
Gave me the grit
to ask her out after that.

80
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:49,687
He's a good man.
Pass along my best to him, will you?

81
00:06:50,187 --> 00:06:51,622
Yes, sir.

82
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:56,557
So, we got ourselves
a video of a murder?

83
00:06:56,877 --> 00:06:58,728
Yes, sir.

84
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:01,206
All right then.

85
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:11,259
<i>Hi! Welcome to Cut Bank, Montana,

86
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:14,504

93
00:07:36,843 --> 00:07:38,848
<i>Dwayne!</i>

94
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,709
That, indeed, is the taking
of a human life.

95
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:51,730
First murder this town has ever seen.

96
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:59,120
Excuse me just one second.

97
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:20,393
- You all right, Sheriff Vogel?
- Dinner ain't sittin' well is all.

98
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:24,014
That was Georgie Wits.

99
00:08:24,115 --> 00:08:26,800
Mailman and beloved town acquaintance.

100
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:30,435
Hell, I never knew him.
Seemed awfully friendly though.

101
00:08:31,687 --> 00:08:37,359
I'll have Mimi dub a copy
for Mrs. Margaret tomorrow first thing.

102
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:06,423
- Sorry.
- My shift ends at 9:00.

103
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:10,076
- Put us in for overtime.
- Any more of this, and I quit.

104
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:15,197
You're almost out.

105
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:31,133
Damn thing suits you better
than it does me.

106
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:37,472
Match, look at your face!

107
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:40,842
You're afraid.

108
00:11:42,946 --> 00:11:47,481
Match, give it up!
It was a joke, okay? I'm sorry!

109
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:53,191
I didn't mean to burn you.
Does that hurt?

110
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,326
Jesus, practice a little self-control.
Get a grip.

111
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:04,099
We're 15 miles from town.
Nobody gonna see us.

112
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:12,476
Oh, nice. Well, let's just
read each other's minds.

113
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:14,710
Be pretty short for me to read yours.

114
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:16,942
Money?

115
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:22,649
Lookit. You want it now, you got it.
Five grand. It's all right here.

116
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,557
Truck make it back to the garage okay?

117
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:30,057
Very good. Anybody see you?

118
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,928
You cut up the truck pretty good.
Anything left?

119
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:43,048
Mail? No, no. You were supposed
to torch the mail. You know that.

120
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:46,576
That was part of the original deal.
I'm sorry, pal. You're not gettin' this.

121
00:12:47,302 --> 00:12:49,479
Jesus.

122
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:53,417
It's yours, it's yours. I'm not one
to go back on a deal. You know that.

123
00:12:53,716 --> 00:12:56,754
I like you. It's a joke.

124
00:12:56,854 --> 00:12:59,222
God. Give me a hug.

125
00:12:59,322 --> 00:13:00,721
Jesus!

126
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,063
Fuckin' Native.

127
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:55,446
Wait!

128
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:57,354
Wait, Dwayne! Wait!

129
00:13:58,114 --> 00:13:59,115
Wait up!

130
00:13:59,415 --> 00:14:01,985
It true about your murder video?

131
00:14:02,085 --> 00:14:04,152
Let me see that thing.

132
00:14:05,922 --> 00:14:09,659
You ought to stop snacking on them Ho Hos,
you got a chance of makin' Pop Warner ball.

133
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,629
- Well, I'm faster than him.
- No, you aren't.

134
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,796
Well, let's see then.

135
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:19,368
Set. Hut!

136
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:31,916
I just received the video, and I alerted
Postal Inspection Services immediately.

137
00:14:32,716 --> 00:14:36,352
While it don't feel fittin',
I was just about to watch this.

138
00:14:36,452 --> 00:14:39,053
So if you'll excuse me just a second...

139
00:15:03,346 --> 00:15:06,649
Now, why would someone
do something like that?

140
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,153
Georgie Wits was a nice man. Harmless.

141
00:15:10,254 --> 00:15:12,456
Canadian, even.

142
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:14,792
What do I need to do?

143
00:15:14,892 --> 00:15:17,258
Oh, I took care of it.

144
00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:21,830
They told me that Postal Inspection Services
should be here before week's end.

145
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:26,803
This troubles my heart so deeply.
A woman my age ain't meant to carry that.

146
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:31,036
Okay. Thanks.

147
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:50,412
Derby Milton.

148
00:15:51,494 --> 00:15:54,597
Your granddaughter ought to take that
insurance confirmation to the post office.

149
00:15:54,898 --> 00:15:58,434
She can get reimbursed for it and make you
a new album at no extra cost.

150
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:03,240
- A sad condition here that we're wearin'.
- Yeah.

151
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,908
How now!

152
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:07,642
Derby Milton? That you?

153
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:11,315
I thought you was dead, son.

154
00:16:11,414 --> 00:16:14,017
You oughta wash
that cabin boy costume more.

155
00:16:14,616 --> 00:16:18,719
Smells like medicines and insects.

156
00:16:21,756 --> 00:16:24,977
Well, Derby.
Ain't you become ever so handsome.

157
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:26,731
What can I do you for?

158
00:16:27,764 --> 00:16:29,577
I'm...

159
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:33,036
waiting on a parcel.

160
00:16:33,135 --> 00:16:38,038
You ain't heard? They murdered the mailman.
Out there on Highway 358.

161
00:16:39,942 --> 00:16:41,298
Where's the mail?

162
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:45,780
They kidnapped it. No sign of Georgie.
No mail. No truck.

163
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:56,158
It might come tomorrow. I'm sorry.

164
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:18,448
I promise he'll return
your call, Mrs. Margaret.

165
00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:19,980
No need to keep callin'.

166
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:25,689
- Mornin', Mimi.
- Sheriff.

167
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:31,858
Killer is drivin' a dually, so let's run
a search through the D.M.V of the F-350s

168
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:37,471
and the Chevy and Dodge 3500s in Glacier
and the neighboring counties. What's this?

169
00:17:37,572 --> 00:17:42,038
Department statement. News stations been
callin' all mornin'. Need you to sign it.

170
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:47,510
What on earth would possess a person
to put six tires on a truck that size?

171
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:52,180
I can't imagine.
Testosterone, I speculate.

172
00:17:53,848 --> 00:17:55,618
I seen Derby Milton.

173
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:59,556
Derby Milton?
I didn't know he was still here.

174
00:17:59,655 --> 00:18:01,791
Outside of the post office.

175
00:18:01,892 --> 00:18:06,128
Stopping the mail chases
even the recluses out of the woodwork.

176
00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:09,566
And let's rustle up a list
of the biggest men in the county.

177
00:18:10,016 --> 00:18:12,251
Get a chance and call Mrs. Margaret.

178
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:16,088
She's been askin' on the progress
of the case all day.

179
00:18:16,189 --> 00:18:19,523
Yeah. And call Mrs. Margaret.

180
00:18:52,857 --> 00:18:55,093
Can't believe it happened on our spot.

181
00:18:56,711 --> 00:19:01,048
Well, not much of a spot.

182
00:19:06,422 --> 00:19:08,592
So you're really getting all that money?

183
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,760
Postal inspector's coming
from the nation's capital to give it to me.

184
00:19:14,096 --> 00:19:17,198
Wow. How much?

185
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:19,701
A lifetime sum.

186
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,436
Shit.

187
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:54,035
I signed up for the Miss Cut
Bank pageant.

188
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,840
- Right.
- Hey! I'm gonna win it.

189
00:19:57,941 --> 00:20:01,077
And we're gonna need those $5,000
to make our new life in Butte.

190
00:20:01,178 --> 00:20:03,211
- Butte?
- Yeah!

191
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:06,048
Don't sell yourself short, hummingbird.

192
00:20:06,148 --> 00:20:08,451
The money I'm getting,
we're moving to California.

193
00:20:08,852 --> 00:20:12,388
- California?
- Yeah. I'll start my own body shop.

194
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:14,857
Ain't like startin' a business
is easy, dummy.

195
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,861
Hey, I'm good for it. May not know
how they do in the city yet,

196
00:20:17,961 --> 00:20:20,563
but I sure as hell know how to fix cars.

197
00:20:20,663 --> 00:20:22,398
You want me workin' for your daddy
the rest of our lives?

198
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:24,500
No way.

199
00:20:41,717 --> 00:20:44,320
You know I'll take care of you.

200
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:47,523
And do whatever it takes.

201
00:20:47,874 --> 00:20:49,723
Yeah.

202
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:53,730
- I'm proud of you.
- I know.

203
00:20:53,829 --> 00:20:57,396
Me and Miss Cut Bank, chasin' it.

204
00:21:09,827 --> 00:21:14,451
You know my lot out there by the fill bins?
The old junk heap I keep for spare parts?

205
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:18,885
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sellin' it off to Marty Corcoran.

206
00:21:19,755 --> 00:21:21,958
If I may, sir,
that place is a gold mine.

207
00:21:22,057 --> 00:21:25,061
Neither me or you or Match or none
of us has been out there in years

208
00:21:25,162 --> 00:21:27,931
for it to be worth the taxes I cough up.

209
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,301
Marty's priced it at a mean dollar.
Way more than it oughta get.

210
00:21:31,402 --> 00:21:34,904
So I'm promoting you out there to forage
for the parts that we can clean up

211
00:21:35,005 --> 00:21:38,069
and use it to shop till the deal's done.

212
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,143
So where the hell was Match today?

213
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:45,848
You know how unreliable Match is.

214
00:21:45,949 --> 00:21:48,984
Well, you gotta learn to take responsibility
for your colleagues.

215
00:21:49,384 --> 00:21:51,251
It's the first lesson of leadership.

216
00:23:46,568 --> 00:23:49,138
What in fuckin' hell are you up to here?

217
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:51,857
Dwayne! I just had a heart attack.

218
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:55,609
- I thought you were the God-forbid.
- I am the God-forbid.

219
00:23:57,546 --> 00:23:59,816
Big Stan's turning his head
to make a dollar off the lot.

220
00:23:59,915 --> 00:24:02,285
He's gonna be passin' by
with Marty Corcoran.

221
00:24:02,384 --> 00:24:04,988
And here you are off in the land of nod

222
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:08,124
with the jazzy playin'
and beer cans all about.

223
00:24:08,223 --> 00:24:10,227
You gotta be the most fat-headed ass.

224
00:24:10,527 --> 00:24:13,963
Whitefish Marty Corcoran? Huge prick.

225
00:24:14,263 --> 00:24:16,566
What the fuck you doin'
loading live rounds?

226
00:24:17,066 --> 00:24:19,201
Protection.

227
00:24:19,301 --> 00:24:23,640
Could you please not point
my own goddamn hand cannon at me?

228
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,473
I have heart problems, Dwayne.

229
00:24:29,444 --> 00:24:31,945
Big Stan's got me foragin'
for parts in the mean.

230
00:24:33,382 --> 00:24:37,420
Well, that's consolation.
We can play us off okay.

231
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:40,155
That ain't any consolation, Georgie.

232
00:24:40,256 --> 00:24:43,226
That's a fuckin' monkey wrench
grabbin' ahold of my innards.

233
00:24:43,326 --> 00:24:47,330
You gotta be on point.
Lock the damn gate. Stick to the plan.

234
00:24:47,431 --> 00:24:51,365
Can we take a breath here? Just relax.

235
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:54,634
My plan, my rules.

236
00:24:55,003 --> 00:24:56,972
You're not gonna fuck this up, Georgie.

237
00:24:57,373 --> 00:24:59,330
Fair enough.

238
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,108
Did you see Mrs. Margaret?

239
00:25:02,478 --> 00:25:04,681
- Yeah.
- And?

240
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:08,548
- Postal inspector should be here any day.
- That's good.

241
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:13,954
That gives us a week, tops.
I need you to relax.

242
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,862
Match did not torch the mail.

243
00:25:18,961 --> 00:25:22,063
It's... I know.
It's still in the garage.

244
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:28,104
I can't do it. I need to be seen workin'.
That's on you, mailman. You're dead.

245
00:25:28,203 --> 00:25:29,472
But you're alive,

246
00:25:29,873 --> 00:25:35,009
and I can't afford to be seen
not dead. So you do it.

247
00:25:36,677 --> 00:25:39,180
God to honest, Georgie.
You keep this place tidy.

248
00:25:40,182 --> 00:25:42,817
No beer cans. No lights.

249
00:25:44,452 --> 00:25:47,355
Am I still the only one
with the number to your prepaid?

250
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,795
Great.

251
00:25:55,497 --> 00:25:57,990
I'll call you if whatever.

252
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,259
Hello. They got me in from Shelby
runnin' the routes.

253
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:02,566
Sure you ain't got a parcel for me?

254
00:27:02,665 --> 00:27:05,231
Yep. Nothin'.

255
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:26,923
Good mornin', Mimi.

256
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:31,027
Give me five bills on Tom's Creek
within the spread.

257
00:27:31,126 --> 00:27:33,529
And tell me how Lester's kid's
been pitching.

258
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,965
There's a postal inspector
from the capital here to visit with you.

259
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:39,802
Nation's capital? What's that?

260
00:27:39,903 --> 00:27:41,738
A list of the county's largest men.

261
00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:45,924
- Jesus Christ! Thirty-five already?
- Did he just take the Lord's name?

262
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:48,542
Depends on how fat he is.
I mean, really fat?

263
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,980
Really?

264
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,916
Really?

265
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:57,420
It's like baby Babe Ruth
kind of a thing?

266
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,421
Well, then I want a grand
on Lester's team.

267
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,159
What do you think this is,
arts and crafts?

268
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:06,794
It's Little League baseball, Oly.
Tell him to sack up!

269
00:28:08,163 --> 00:28:11,101
So, I was told that this is
the coldest town in the nation,

270
00:28:11,201 --> 00:28:15,436
and yet I'm sweating
like a whore in church.

271
00:28:15,537 --> 00:28:17,406
Temperature moderates in summer.

272
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:20,442
- Have you had lunch yet?
- Forgot it again at home.

273
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:23,813
What is the best steakhouse you got?
I need a beer.

274
00:28:24,313 --> 00:28:26,932
- There you go, fellas.
- Thank you, darlin'.

275
00:28:27,182 --> 00:28:29,553
For you, and for you.

276
00:28:29,653 --> 00:28:31,587
Yes. Thank you, darling.

277
00:28:31,688 --> 00:28:34,590
United States Postal Inspector
Joe Barret. It's a pleasure.

278
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:37,160
Oh. It's a pleasure to meet ya.

279
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:41,127
Okay. Enjoy, Sheriff Vogel,
Inspector Joe.

280
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,070
Appreciate understated establishments.

281
00:28:51,173 --> 00:28:55,375
Best meals always found
in the unlikeliest of places, right?

282
00:28:59,013 --> 00:29:02,117
Best fuckin' steak I ever had?

283
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:03,385
This one.

284
00:29:03,786 --> 00:29:06,053
Harvey's known to be a grill master.

285
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:13,329
I hear right, you're competin'
in this year's Miss Cut Bank pageant?

286
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,534
Bet you didn't know I was Miss Cut Bank.

287
00:29:17,634 --> 00:29:19,501
Yep.

288
00:29:20,602 --> 00:29:22,271
1987.

289
00:29:22,672 --> 00:29:24,508
What?

290
00:29:25,107 --> 00:29:27,694
And I'm telling you this 'cause...

291
00:29:27,795 --> 00:29:31,548
well, between you and me,
you got real good chances of winnin'.

292
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:33,115
Yeah?

293
00:29:33,215 --> 00:29:35,758
Be one of the most important days
you'll ever live.

294
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:37,921
Speaking of which,
I got this thing back home.

295
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,888
In our nation's capital?

296
00:29:39,989 --> 00:29:42,224
Bethesda. It's the neighbor town.

297
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:44,626
Anyway, this thing...

298
00:29:44,727 --> 00:29:47,596
- Do you have kids, Sheriff Vogel?
- No, sir.

299
00:29:47,697 --> 00:29:49,265
Well...

300
00:29:49,365 --> 00:29:53,103
Please. You're the sheriff,
I'm the inspector. We're two of the same.

301
00:29:53,202 --> 00:29:55,237
You call me Joe, I call you...

302
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:57,707
Sheriff Vogel.

303
00:29:57,807 --> 00:30:01,678
- That a first and last name?
- Just my name.

304
00:30:02,178 --> 00:30:06,582
- Have I offended you somehow, Sheriff?
- No, sir... Joe.

305
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:09,817
If I seem wooden, it's only because
I'm havin' a little trouble

306
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:11,988
understanding what your purpose
is here, Joe.

307
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:14,891
I got a town full of concerned citizens

308
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:19,028
and a puzzle of a case that needs fittin'
the pieces together.

309
00:30:19,128 --> 00:30:22,965
So, you know, I got big-time duties
I got to get back to.

310
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:25,300
I'll be brief.

311
00:30:25,401 --> 00:30:29,375
I got this engagement back home top
of the week. Once-in-a-year kind of a thing.

312
00:30:29,474 --> 00:30:31,328
- Sounds pressing.
- Indeed.

313
00:30:31,778 --> 00:30:34,877
Service heard there's a videotape of one
of their employees getting murdered,

314
00:30:34,978 --> 00:30:39,315
sent me out here to pass along
a large reward to the creator of said video.

315
00:30:39,414 --> 00:30:42,039
My hope is that you and I
work together expeditiously,

316
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:47,232
get this deal done, so we can all get back
to our pressing matters. What sayest?

317
00:30:48,156 --> 00:30:50,993
Reasonable man. I do like you,
Sheriff Vogel. Really, I do.

318
00:30:51,094 --> 00:30:54,130
- Have you seen the video?
- Yes, sir... Joe.

319
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,096
Does your mailman get murdered in it?

320
00:30:58,266 --> 00:30:59,902
Evidence for a court.

321
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:05,508
All I need is to see the mailman's
dead body, and we are set.

322
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:10,845
I'm at the Glacier Gateway Inn,
and this has been a pleasure.

323
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:51,820
Excuse me, Mr. Match.

324
00:31:51,921 --> 00:31:54,055
We were wonderin' if you can be "it."

325
00:32:03,699 --> 00:32:05,031
He's counting!

326
00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:28,422
Say. Ain't you Derby Milton?

327
00:32:31,358 --> 00:32:34,094
Ain't this somethin'?
I... I thought you was dead.

328
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,099
I can help you with that.

329
00:32:41,403 --> 00:32:45,221
I remember. You was always quiet.

330
00:32:46,608 --> 00:32:48,861
Really smart too.

331
00:32:49,978 --> 00:32:51,847
Derby Milton.

332
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,083
Come to think,

333
00:32:54,383 --> 00:32:57,451
I ain't seen you since you was workin'
at the national park.

334
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:06,128
You have these in a bigger size?

335
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:10,698
What do you need a bigger size for?
Say you're a... nine?

336
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:15,505
Besides, we don't carry
anything above a 14.

337
00:33:15,605 --> 00:33:18,441
Anybody buy a bigger size of these?

338
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,611
That's an odd thing to ask.
Why are you askin'?

339
00:33:27,147 --> 00:33:31,788
We'd have to special order a shoe
of that size in from the manufacturer.

340
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:35,522
Well... we haven't.

341
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,528
Well, let me check
with our sister store in Browning.

342
00:34:07,556 --> 00:34:11,425
Native on the reservation ordered
a size 16 'bout seven months ago.

343
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:15,097
Thank you.

344
00:34:15,498 --> 00:34:19,233
So... taking you don't
need the nines, or...

345
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,101
Perhaps you can show me the mail truck.

346
00:35:17,893 --> 00:35:20,762
Parcel in there belongs to me.

347
00:35:20,862 --> 00:35:23,396
Perhaps you saw it.

348
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:36,610
Perhaps your... accomplices may know
where I can find my parcel.

349
00:36:01,474 --> 00:36:04,840
I would appreciate if you told me...

350
00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:08,976
where I can find my parcel.

351
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:13,376
Hi. My name is Cassandra Steely,

352
00:37:13,476 --> 00:37:18,202
and I think I'd make a great
Miss Cut Bank because...

353
00:37:19,342 --> 00:37:22,983
<i>Ain't no mountain high,
ain't no valley low</i>

354
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:26,987
<i>Ain't no river wide enough, baby</i>

355
00:37:27,088 --> 00:37:30,784
<i>If you need me call me
no matter where you are</i>

356
00:37:30,885 --> 00:37:34,326
<i>No matter how far, don't worry baby</i>

357
00:37:34,425 --> 00:37:37,012
<i>Just call my name...</i>

358
00:37:37,112 --> 00:37:38,882
Hey!

359
00:37:40,827 --> 00:37:45,240
- I keep running into you, Sheriff Vogel.
- Don't it seem? Pretty good.

360
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,610
Oh, thanks. Only space
that's wide enough like a stage,

361
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,478
so I've been practicing my dance.

362
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:54,307
Well, the bit I saw looked
blue ribbon to me. Your daddy in?

363
00:37:54,407 --> 00:37:57,119
- No, he's not. You try his cell?
- Ain't pickin' up.

364
00:37:57,518 --> 00:38:00,289
Oh. Must be with a client.
He never picks up when he's with clients.

365
00:38:00,389 --> 00:38:04,425
Yeah. Just wanted to inquire about a truck.
I'll see him when I do.

366
00:38:05,626 --> 00:38:09,454
You know, Dwayne's out back.
Maybe he can help ya.

367
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:13,266
Okay. Well... keep doin'
what you're doin'.

368
00:38:16,269 --> 00:38:19,974
- How's the investigation?
- Oh, comin' along.

369
00:38:20,074 --> 00:38:22,277
I sure feel okay with you on it.

370
00:38:22,378 --> 00:38:25,547
And Dwayne...
he thinks of you like a daddy, so...

371
00:38:25,648 --> 00:38:29,226
Just thanks for what you're doin'.

372
00:38:29,717 --> 00:38:32,472
Good luck with your dancin'.

373
00:38:34,422 --> 00:38:35,789
Hiya, Dwayne.

374
00:38:37,057 --> 00:38:39,295
Sheriff Vogel.

375
00:38:39,394 --> 00:38:41,664
Pretty slow business today.

376
00:38:41,764 --> 00:38:46,434
We're closed. Steeley's got me
at the junk lot foragin' for usable parts.

377
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:51,039
- Fixin' to sell the lot to Marty Corcoran.
- Whitefish Marty Corcoran. Good fella.

378
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:54,043
Had a question for your boss.
Maybe you can help me with it.

379
00:38:54,445 --> 00:38:55,684
Sure.

380
00:38:55,784 --> 00:38:59,880
Do you remember seein' around here
a dually 'bout the size of an F-350?

381
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:05,945
Used to have a truck like that back
when we towed, but that was...

382
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:07,387
five, six years ago.

383
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:12,826
- Steeley gave it away.
- You know who he gave it to?

384
00:39:14,195 --> 00:39:15,561
No. Sorry.

385
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:21,737
- You work here alone?
- Me and the Native.

386
00:39:21,836 --> 00:39:24,940
The Native... What's his name?

387
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,177
- Match.
- Match. Match what?

388
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,041
Tasunke.

389
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:34,483
Match Tasunke.

390
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:36,385
Where is he today?

391
00:39:36,485 --> 00:39:38,820
Ain't seen him since a few days back.

392
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,458
By the way, I had lunch today
with that postal inspector from D.C.,

393
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:46,612
and he wants to meet you,
but I gotta find the body first.

394
00:39:46,711 --> 00:39:48,864
Then you'll be set.

395
00:39:48,963 --> 00:39:51,331
The body?

396
00:39:58,005 --> 00:39:59,932
Match Tasunke?

397
00:41:03,304 --> 00:41:06,224
Mr. Tasunke? Police.

398
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:09,311
<i>Hello. No one is available
to take your call.</i>

399
00:41:09,411 --> 00:41:12,871
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

400
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,389
It's a swell property.

401
00:42:04,766 --> 00:42:06,932
Let's deal inside.

402
00:42:09,704 --> 00:42:11,405
Step right in, Marty.

403
00:42:12,507 --> 00:42:14,976
Jesus H.

404
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:18,586
Oh, come on. Kid doesn't appreciate
vintage when he sees it.

405
00:42:18,686 --> 00:42:20,882
Certainly appreciates that funny nectar.

406
00:42:21,483 --> 00:42:24,184
I'm sorry about the state
around here, Marty.

407
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:43,204
It's all about the structure, you know?
The property.

408
00:42:43,304 --> 00:42:45,472
- That's the important thing.
- Jesus.

409
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,594
Jesus.

410
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:57,918
- Get back to ya.
- Right.

411
00:42:58,686 --> 00:42:59,913
It's good seein' you.

412
00:43:00,755 --> 00:43:02,523
- Dwayne.
- Mr. Corcoran.

413
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:06,192
- Well, give my best to Sherry, will you?
- Bet ya.

414
00:43:11,498 --> 00:43:13,068
What the hell's going on here?

415
00:43:13,168 --> 00:43:16,704
I come with my prospective buyer,
and you make me out to be an imbecile.

416
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:20,742
All the blinds are shut, there's enough
beer cans over there for a three-day binge,

417
00:43:20,842 --> 00:43:23,548
phonograph turnin'.
Looks like a hobo camp in here.

418
00:43:23,648 --> 00:43:25,652
- Won't happen again, sir.
- You're damn right!

419
00:43:26,202 --> 00:43:29,318
Give thanks I don't
turn you to unemployment, kid.

420
00:43:29,418 --> 00:43:32,288
- Is your brow sweatin'?
- No, sir.

421
00:43:32,387 --> 00:43:34,889
Look me in the eye
when I'm talkin' to you.

422
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:37,960
I've been cleaning them parts
like you said.

423
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:41,134
I'm sorry about the beer.

424
00:43:41,233 --> 00:43:42,596
I'm on to you.

425
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:49,070
What are you talking about?

426
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,925
Of all the places
you can point a camera,

427
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:56,625
you point it at a money-makin' crime.
Now, that's downright lucky,

428
00:43:56,724 --> 00:43:59,581
and lucky don't run in your blood.
You and me both know that.

429
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,951
It'd take perfect execution to pull off
that kinda ploy, and I ain't smart for that.

430
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:06,159
Your squirrelly ass don't wanna know
what'll happen if you stick around.

431
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:12,125
You abused my trust.
I thought better of you.

432
00:44:13,262 --> 00:44:14,565
Now get outta here.

433
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:16,630
- Big Stan...
- Get!

434
00:44:17,766 --> 00:44:19,994
I'm pretty goddamned
disappointed in you!

435
00:44:20,193 --> 00:44:22,969
You stay out of my face!
Don't make me tell you again.

436
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:37,784
Now who do we have here?

437
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,226
What, are you tweeked
on some drugs or something?

438
00:44:45,327 --> 00:44:47,429
Get out of there!

439
00:44:47,528 --> 00:44:49,398
- Come on! Get out!
- Oh, geez.

440
00:44:49,498 --> 00:44:51,536
Get out of there!

441
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:58,271
Georgie Wits?

442
00:45:01,442 --> 00:45:02,597
Me?

443
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,719
You mind givin' us a minute?

444
00:46:09,818 --> 00:46:11,413
I'm done here at 9:00.

445
00:46:12,213 --> 00:46:15,981
I got events under way
that are makin' my time difficult.

446
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:19,452
I'd appreciate if you'd draw your line
in the sand some other time.

447
00:46:26,527 --> 00:46:28,780
I need privacy.

448
00:46:49,117 --> 00:46:53,152
I got somethin' on my chest,
and I'm just gonna say it, if it's okay.

449
00:46:55,655 --> 00:46:58,623
I know how hard this will be on you.

450
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:07,065
That business you seen on the news
about the mailman...

451
00:47:09,903 --> 00:47:12,938
I set everyone up on that.

452
00:47:13,673 --> 00:47:15,740
I did it.

453
00:47:17,577 --> 00:47:19,644
And I'm sorry.

454
00:47:23,951 --> 00:47:27,987
I never wanted to let you down,
but I wanted you to know in honest.

455
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:35,061
I ruined everything.

456
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:39,998
I ruined everything, and I'm sorry.

457
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:44,914
I'm so sorry.

458
00:48:39,492 --> 00:48:42,195
Thought you was dead.

459
00:48:57,206 --> 00:49:00,246
I'm looking for my parcel.

460
00:49:01,047 --> 00:49:03,349
Figure you stoled it.

461
00:49:04,085 --> 00:49:06,338
It was addressed to...

462
00:49:06,438 --> 00:49:09,804
4 Woolly Walnut Trail.

463
00:49:09,903 --> 00:49:12,626
I deliver a package there
every year in June.

464
00:49:12,726 --> 00:49:16,561
You know how many flats I've had
trying to get to you?

465
00:49:17,697 --> 00:49:19,632
I know where your package is.

466
00:49:21,101 --> 00:49:24,570
You operate on one really
weird mail cycle.

467
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:27,742
I...

468
00:49:27,842 --> 00:49:31,146
- I ain't got patience.
- Patience?

469
00:49:31,686 --> 00:49:34,481
Well, that's a fuckin' virtue.
You ought to get it.

470
00:49:36,146 --> 00:49:39,054
Gonna give me hitches like the Indian?

471
00:49:39,153 --> 00:49:41,789
You threatened the Native?

472
00:49:42,289 --> 00:49:44,456
Oh, I'm sure you got a lot out of him.

473
00:49:47,961 --> 00:49:50,398
You know, I... I don't like your tone.

474
00:49:50,498 --> 00:49:55,336
That's... That shit you're doing
with the... crowbar there...

475
00:49:55,436 --> 00:49:58,304
and your tone, I don't like it.

476
00:49:59,306 --> 00:50:03,777
And you think you're gonna come threaten me
and pry your package out of me?

477
00:50:04,077 --> 00:50:06,280
Well, that's real fuckin' clever.

478
00:50:06,681 --> 00:50:09,684
You know what? I'm starting to think
that you might be an asshole.

479
00:50:09,784 --> 00:50:11,786
It doesn't have to be like that.

480
00:50:11,887 --> 00:50:15,891
You can talk to me like a civilized
fucking human being.

481
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:19,168
Just want my parcel.

482
00:50:19,793 --> 00:50:23,831
Well, you know what? Fuck you.

483
00:50:24,436 --> 00:50:28,369
I got news for you.
Your way ain't the way shit works.

484
00:50:28,469 --> 00:50:33,085
You can't just come up here and prance in
anytime you want and knock me around

485
00:50:33,184 --> 00:50:35,076
on your own agenda.

486
00:50:35,175 --> 00:50:38,313
I got my own agenda.

487
00:50:38,413 --> 00:50:40,315
But does anybody respect it?

488
00:50:40,715 --> 00:50:42,851
No way, José.

489
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:45,956
You're the virus of my job.

490
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:50,023
A forest-child fuckin' mongoloid.

491
00:50:51,025 --> 00:50:53,260
What? You want me to smile at you...

492
00:50:53,561 --> 00:50:56,498
like a happy fucking mailman?

493
00:50:56,597 --> 00:50:59,333
Oh, creepy fuck nuts,

494
00:50:59,434 --> 00:51:03,538
thank you so much
for showing me your shiny lever.

495
00:51:03,637 --> 00:51:08,043
Well, for me, all day long it's... "Howdy,
ma'am. How are you? Here's your mail.

496
00:51:08,143 --> 00:51:10,211
Say hi to the kids for me."

497
00:51:10,311 --> 00:51:13,411
I got pleasantries demanded of me,

498
00:51:13,512 --> 00:51:15,182
I say fuck it.

499
00:51:15,882 --> 00:51:17,699
And fuck them.

500
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,170
And fuck you!

501
00:51:35,903 --> 00:51:39,541
I'm sorry. I was kidding.

502
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:41,443
It was a joke.

503
00:51:41,643 --> 00:51:44,844
I mean, I don't know much.
It was the other guy all the way.

504
00:51:44,943 --> 00:51:49,117
It was his plan, not mine. Come on,
we're friends, man. We're friends.

505
00:51:49,217 --> 00:51:54,452
I mean, it was... it was Dwayne.
Come on, it's... We're... we're friends.

506
00:53:15,969 --> 00:53:19,574
- Sheriff Vogel?
- Just the man I needed to see.

507
00:53:19,673 --> 00:53:22,543
- I need to talk to you.
- Did you see Big Stan?

508
00:53:22,844 --> 00:53:25,012
- Yeah.
- Did you tell him I needed a word with him?

509
00:53:25,112 --> 00:53:27,231
- I didn't get a chance to get a word...
- When did you see him?

510
00:53:28,815 --> 00:53:33,130
Midday. He was... transacting a deal
with Marty Corcoran at the junk lot.

511
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,570
I figured. I couldn't
get ahold of him at all.

512
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:39,090
- Sir, I...
- You know what I seen today?

513
00:53:39,393 --> 00:53:42,195
Match Tasunke murdered in his own home.

514
00:53:44,664 --> 00:53:48,900
This must be the most disappointing
day of my entire life.

515
00:53:50,036 --> 00:53:51,539
Match is dead?

516
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:54,943
Murdered. Second murder on this case.

517
00:53:55,043 --> 00:53:57,945
First murder I seen in person.

518
00:53:58,045 --> 00:54:02,382
I'm sorry, son. I should have delivered
that news more kindly.

519
00:54:04,351 --> 00:54:07,251
And Mrs. Steeley calls.
She's worried stiff

520
00:54:07,351 --> 00:54:10,958
'cause she hasn't heard from her husband
all day, and he didn't come home tonight.

521
00:54:11,059 --> 00:54:12,726
Don't mention that to Cassandra,

522
00:54:12,827 --> 00:54:17,195
'cause these things tend
to turn out quiet more often than not.

523
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:25,005
Listen, I want you to take Cassandra
out tonight, show her a good time...

524
00:54:25,105 --> 00:54:28,275
with her mother's blessing.

525
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:30,851
- Okay? Can I trust you?
- No, sir. I can't.

526
00:54:30,952 --> 00:54:34,512
Take it. You're good for it.

527
00:54:35,048 --> 00:54:38,784
And if you're not, I know
where to find you. Go on, son.

528
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:43,922
I'm gonna go off to have a poke
around Big Stan's junk lot.

529
00:55:26,032 --> 00:55:28,668
Hello. This is Jorry's.

530
00:55:28,768 --> 00:55:30,704
Hello?

531
00:55:31,905 --> 00:55:35,175
Next time you want to do double
or nothin', Kenny, I am right here.

532
00:56:55,387 --> 00:56:59,365
<i>We were born before the wind</i>

533
00:57:01,777 --> 00:57:05,601
<i>Also younger than the sun</i>

534
00:57:07,969 --> 00:57:13,172
<i>Ere the bonnie boat was won
as we sailed into the mystic</i>

535
00:57:18,213 --> 00:57:22,469
<i>Hark, now hear the sailors cry</i>

536
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,965
<i>Smell the sea and feel the sky</i>

537
00:57:29,492 --> 00:57:33,594
Looks like the fellow prodded
the collarbone. Used some sort of jimmy.

538
00:57:34,447 --> 00:57:35,996
Wasn't enough just to shoot him?

539
00:57:36,097 --> 00:57:39,014
What'd they torture Georgie for?

540
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:41,907
My little hustler.

541
00:57:42,007 --> 00:57:45,393
<i>And when that fog horn blows</i>

542
00:57:45,893 --> 00:57:48,853
<i>I will be coming home</i>

543
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:01,606
Dwayne.

544
00:58:01,856 --> 00:58:05,693
- You good?
- Yeah. What's happened? Turn that up.

545
00:58:05,793 --> 00:58:09,128
<i>Georgie Wits has indeed
been confirmed dead.</i>

546
00:58:09,228 --> 00:58:11,865
<i>His body was discovered
at a derelict junk lot...</i>

547
00:58:11,965 --> 00:58:15,235
- <i>...on the outskirts of Cut Bank.</i>
- Y'all remember?

548
00:58:15,335 --> 00:58:17,972
- <i>We've yet to receive an official statement.</i>
- I love you.

549
00:58:18,072 --> 00:58:22,110
<i>But what I can tell you is
that the mood here is certainly somber.</i>

550
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:25,918
- <i>Thank you for that special report.</i>
- Well, I'll be damned.

551
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:29,414
- They found Georgie Wits.
- We got to go.

552
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:31,150
Come on.

553
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,092
He'll be in the freezer till the medical
examiner gets back from Great Falls.

554
00:58:38,192 --> 00:58:40,994
- When the fuck's that happening?
- Figure on Monday.

555
00:58:41,094 --> 00:58:42,163
Goddamn it.

556
00:58:42,563 --> 00:58:45,115
So... So I get my death
certificate then?

557
00:58:45,766 --> 00:58:51,338
Georgie Wits appears tortured and dead
right here on Big Stan's plot

558
00:58:51,438 --> 00:58:54,375
while Big Stan up and disappears.

559
00:58:54,474 --> 00:58:56,811
And that ain't a puzzle to you?

560
00:58:56,911 --> 00:58:59,344
Who the fuck's Big Stan?

561
00:58:59,913 --> 00:59:01,646
Sheriff Vogel, I got somethin'.

562
00:59:12,726 --> 00:59:14,561
Who's that?

563
00:59:14,661 --> 00:59:17,195
That's Big Stan.

564
00:59:23,168 --> 00:59:25,170
We got to leave town tonight.

565
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:29,307
There's a man on a rampage
huntin' people.

566
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:34,045
He killed Georgie. He killed Match.
Now he's comin' after me.

567
00:59:35,715 --> 00:59:39,083
Now or never, no lookin' back.
Can you do that?

568
00:59:42,188 --> 00:59:44,690
Baby, he's gonna kill me.

569
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:50,681
- I been callin' and callin'! We gotta go!
- What?

570
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:54,333
He ain't woke up yet,
but he's alive. Come on.

571
01:00:12,485 --> 01:00:14,987
What, you make a habit
out of cowin' girls like that?

572
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:25,963
Now, Milton boy.

573
01:00:27,733 --> 01:00:30,170
Derby.

574
01:00:30,271 --> 01:00:32,103
Derby Milton.

575
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:35,907
I should see the other hombre, right?

576
01:00:39,545 --> 01:00:42,983
- Dwayne McClaren here?
- Took off with his girlie.

577
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:47,452
God knows what they're doin'
and where they're doin' it.

578
01:00:48,155 --> 01:00:51,789
You know she's competin'
in the Miss Cut Bank pageant tomorrow?

579
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:57,228
You remember me
when I was Miss Cut Bank?

580
01:00:57,731 --> 01:01:02,769
I remember you sitting up there
in the third row

581
01:01:02,869 --> 01:01:07,358
watchin' me with those cute
little pencil-head eyes.

582
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:11,242
I bet you were undressin' me
in your head.

583
01:01:19,186 --> 01:01:21,253
Closed.

584
01:01:22,989 --> 01:01:25,579
We're closed.

585
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:28,429
Hey, aren't you
that twitchy fuckin' recluse?

586
01:01:28,528 --> 01:01:33,134
Easy, Harvey. Derby Milton
ain't nothin' but gentlemanly.

587
01:01:33,233 --> 01:01:36,143
I asked you a question, boy.

588
01:01:38,338 --> 01:01:40,405
Hey, where are you goin'?

589
01:02:01,994 --> 01:02:06,934
So, the Dwayne McClaren.

590
01:02:07,034 --> 01:02:09,775
Got you a piece of peach cobbler.

591
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:11,289
Little known fact...

592
01:02:11,389 --> 01:02:15,608
the best cobblers in the world
are found in hospital food courts.

593
01:02:17,309 --> 01:02:19,043
You're not gonna eat all that, are you?

594
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,340
U.S.P.I. Joe Barret.

595
01:02:29,889 --> 01:02:31,291
Congratulations, kid.

596
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:34,262
I send you your check as soon as
the sheriff does his paperwork.

597
01:02:34,362 --> 01:02:37,280
Shouldn't be more
than a few months or so.

598
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:41,268
- I thought it was immediate.
- Nothing's immediate in this life...

599
01:02:41,369 --> 01:02:42,869
except self-stimulation,

600
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:45,954
and even that sometimes,
you know, takes a little patience.

601
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:51,960
Damn. This is the best
fucking cobbler I ever had.

602
01:02:52,228 --> 01:02:54,423
Can I give you a forwarding address?

603
01:02:54,523 --> 01:02:56,927
I don't see why not.

604
01:02:58,501 --> 01:03:00,436
What's the capital like?

605
01:03:02,105 --> 01:03:06,277
Dirty, stressful, angry,

606
01:03:06,376 --> 01:03:09,965
lonely, corrupt and expensive.

607
01:03:10,065 --> 01:03:12,813
- And you like it?
- I love it.

608
01:03:15,117 --> 01:03:16,385
Thank you, sir.

609
01:03:17,219 --> 01:03:19,788
I'll be in touch.

610
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:34,869
He's still unconscious.

611
01:03:42,846 --> 01:03:44,641
We're not getting the money.

612
01:03:46,483 --> 01:03:47,449
What?

613
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:50,045
Not for a few months.

614
01:03:53,655 --> 01:03:56,554
I have to win the pageant then.

615
01:03:56,655 --> 01:03:58,211
Dwayne, we can't leave till after.

616
01:04:07,771 --> 01:04:10,105
We'll stay here
with Big Steeley tonight.

617
01:04:17,813 --> 01:04:20,251
<i>Harvey called in
from Jorry's late night.</i>

618
01:04:20,351 --> 01:04:22,820
Drunk brawl's his problem.

619
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,704
<i>He's saying Derby Milton come in
after closing lookin' to whoop.</i>

620
01:04:26,804 --> 01:04:29,860
<i>Harvey wants his due redressal.</i>

621
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,510
Derby Milton?

622
01:04:33,096 --> 01:04:37,715
I'll see to it before I come in today.
Thanks much, Mimi.

623
01:04:55,918 --> 01:04:59,590
We, the people, in order to form
a more perfect union...

624
01:05:01,492 --> 01:05:04,025
Dry them tears.

625
01:05:05,228 --> 01:05:07,474
Look at me.

626
01:05:11,867 --> 01:05:13,882
Hummingbird,

627
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:15,838
you're ready.

628
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,909
It just don't feel right
with everything and whatnot.

629
01:05:20,409 --> 01:05:22,346
We just seen him.

630
01:05:22,445 --> 01:05:24,949
Nurse said he'll wake up soon enough
and he'll be A-plus.

631
01:05:25,356 --> 01:05:27,449
Okay?

632
01:06:05,088 --> 01:06:09,157
Derby Milton, Sheriff Vogel.
Just need a word.

633
01:06:32,949 --> 01:06:34,661
Derby Milton?

634
01:06:55,972 --> 01:06:58,275
Hi. My name's Cassandra Steeley.

635
01:06:58,375 --> 01:07:02,476
And I think I'd make a great
Miss Cut Bank because...

636
01:07:02,577 --> 01:07:05,362
<i>Listen, baby</i>

637
01:07:05,463 --> 01:07:09,108
<i>Ain't no mountain high,
ain't no valley low</i>

638
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:13,043
<i>Ain't no river wide enough, baby</i>

639
01:07:13,143 --> 01:07:16,820
<i>If you need me call me
no matter where you are</i>

640
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,637
<i>No matter how far...</i>

641
01:08:18,233 --> 01:08:22,122
So, what's this secret business
you got with Derby Milton?

642
01:08:23,059 --> 01:08:25,863
He stopped by Jorry's after hours
last night askin' about you.

643
01:08:26,863 --> 01:08:29,417
Whooped up on Harvey real good.

644
01:09:06,668 --> 01:09:08,872
Freeze! On the ground!

645
01:09:08,972 --> 01:09:11,537
On the ground!

646
01:12:00,509 --> 01:12:04,078
Your daddy used to carry
that rifle with him every day.

647
01:12:06,282 --> 01:12:08,805
You look like him.

648
01:12:10,819 --> 01:12:11,886
Chamber's empty.

649
01:12:31,673 --> 01:12:34,243
This six-shooter familiar to you?

650
01:12:35,243 --> 01:12:36,912
Why are you huntin' me now?

651
01:12:38,314 --> 01:12:41,748
Huntin' for my parcel.

652
01:12:46,255 --> 01:12:49,581
Spent last night sittin' right here.

653
01:12:51,327 --> 01:12:53,137
Orson and me

654
01:12:53,238 --> 01:12:57,810
used to be colleagues.

655
01:12:58,266 --> 01:13:00,337
Oh, yeah?

656
01:13:00,537 --> 01:13:05,576
Both us worked at the national park.

657
01:13:06,412 --> 01:13:10,211
- Never knew he left town.
- He did.

658
01:13:10,613 --> 01:13:13,015
Two summers.

659
01:13:13,115 --> 01:13:17,051
That rifle got me thinkin'
on a time then.

660
01:13:18,386 --> 01:13:20,591
And then one mornin',

661
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:25,206
Orson here finds
the lodge kitchen a mess.

662
01:13:26,429 --> 01:13:32,198
Seems a mama bear
broke in lookin' for supper.

663
01:13:33,002 --> 01:13:35,069
Same night...

664
01:13:37,939 --> 01:13:40,978
her two babies find the dumpster...

665
01:13:41,078 --> 01:13:44,811
and climb on in for a feast.

666
01:13:45,314 --> 01:13:48,815
I remember that mornin' clearly.

667
01:13:49,451 --> 01:13:53,993
Ranger decided
mama had crossed the line.

668
01:13:55,091 --> 01:14:00,159
Become a threat to public safety.

669
01:14:02,797 --> 01:14:06,569
Ranger and me and Orson picked 'em up,

670
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:12,163
take 'em into the woods
like normal. But this time, the...

671
01:14:12,963 --> 01:14:17,548
ranger tells Orson
to get his Winchester.

672
01:14:20,048 --> 01:14:24,284
Orson says... he can't do it.

673
01:14:26,721 --> 01:14:29,613
Ranger hands it to me.

674
01:14:33,497 --> 01:14:36,564
Says, "Babies first."

675
01:14:48,210 --> 01:14:50,948
Like I was sacrificing a lamb...

676
01:14:51,047 --> 01:14:54,518
so people could smile on and...

677
01:14:54,618 --> 01:14:56,485
s...

678
01:14:56,586 --> 01:14:59,514
snap their photos.

679
01:15:03,059 --> 01:15:06,395
I ain't been able to see
folks for nothin' but...

680
01:15:06,496 --> 01:15:11,030
talkin' bobbleheads since.

681
01:15:14,569 --> 01:15:16,707
And... animals?

682
01:15:16,806 --> 01:15:20,824
Been keepin' 'em safe from people.

683
01:15:22,078 --> 01:15:25,011
Preservin' their honesty.

684
01:15:26,782 --> 01:15:29,301
Started that fall.

685
01:15:30,252 --> 01:15:33,820
Poacher stumbled upon my place.

686
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:36,858
Perturbed me.

687
01:15:37,859 --> 01:15:42,341
So I snatched his neck.

688
01:15:45,667 --> 01:15:49,228
I need that parcel.

689
01:15:49,572 --> 01:15:50,904
Dwayne?

690
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:56,978
Are you here? Baby?

691
01:15:59,481 --> 01:16:01,118
Here you are.

692
01:16:01,217 --> 01:16:04,292
Where were you? I won!

693
01:16:05,854 --> 01:16:07,122
Close your eyes.

694
01:16:11,926 --> 01:16:14,297
You don't see me,

695
01:16:14,898 --> 01:16:17,461
I don't see you.

696
01:16:33,448 --> 01:16:36,261
This calms the nerves.

697
01:16:49,899 --> 01:16:52,801
That'll kill ya.

698
01:16:54,036 --> 01:16:58,572
You mind if I... out the window?

699
01:17:07,483 --> 01:17:09,951
You a litterbug?

700
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:27,368
She ain't got nothin' to do with this.
She don't know nothin'.

701
01:17:34,042 --> 01:17:36,176
No more talking.

702
01:17:47,122 --> 01:17:49,858
Get down. Stay low.

703
01:17:51,926 --> 01:17:56,095
- We're closed.
- Just need to grab somethin' from 224.

704
01:17:59,568 --> 01:18:00,734
If you don't mind.

705
01:18:15,369 --> 01:18:18,252
I'm right here. We're gonna be fine.

706
01:18:25,894 --> 01:18:28,436
It's okay. It's okay.

707
01:19:01,697 --> 01:19:03,064
What's inside?

708
01:19:10,805 --> 01:19:11,840
Nothin'.

709
01:19:16,704 --> 01:19:19,181
I'm here. We're gonna be fine.

710
01:19:19,282 --> 01:19:22,984
We're gonna be fine. Okay?
We're gonna be fine.

711
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:28,970
You been...

712
01:19:29,757 --> 01:19:31,421
decent with me.

713
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:53,514
I was gonna be... decent back.

714
01:20:00,221 --> 01:20:01,889
What are you doin'?

715
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:16,043
- Hey, you don't have to do that.
- Please.

716
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:18,707
Please, please, don't do that.
Don't do that.

717
01:20:19,666 --> 01:20:22,805
Come on, please. Don't do that.
Don't do that. Please.

718
01:20:22,905 --> 01:20:25,296
Come on, man. Come on. Come on.

719
01:20:25,697 --> 01:20:28,782
Listen to me. Listen to me.

720
01:20:29,684 --> 01:20:32,855
Slow breaths, babe. Slow breaths.
Slow breaths, okay?

721
01:20:32,956 --> 01:20:36,708
I'm right here. We're gonna be fine.
We're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine.

722
01:21:12,827 --> 01:21:16,324
Derby Milton, freeze right there.

723
01:21:19,134 --> 01:21:23,637
Step out of the car, Derby Milton.
Show me your hands.

724
01:22:47,088 --> 01:22:50,327
I had a curious dream while I was under.

725
01:22:50,426 --> 01:22:54,264
I was at our old fishin' hole
from when we were kids.

726
01:22:54,363 --> 01:22:58,811
It's true about flashing visions
of your life and the pearly gates?

727
01:22:58,912 --> 01:23:01,170
It wasn't like that.

728
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:06,472
I saw that damn rabbit's foot
you're twirlin' around your finger there.

729
01:23:07,242 --> 01:23:10,277
Could have been any rabbit foot.

730
01:23:11,846 --> 01:23:16,917
Celine Towers gave you that damn thing
the day she left town for good.

731
01:23:17,819 --> 01:23:21,690
And she wanted you to go with her,
and you didn't.

732
01:23:21,791 --> 01:23:25,292
I never could understand why myself.

733
01:23:26,295 --> 01:23:29,097
I wanted that gesture so bad.

734
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:34,467
I wanted Celine to swoop back
into town and take me away.

735
01:23:36,872 --> 01:23:39,208
And now I'm...

736
01:23:39,309 --> 01:23:42,672
married with family for nearly 27 years.

737
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:47,314
You had your chance.

738
01:23:50,385 --> 01:23:54,742
I'm figurin' I can't control
the way things change.

739
01:23:56,524 --> 01:23:59,025
I ought to stop tryin'.

740
01:24:01,329 --> 01:24:04,097
It seems for the best.

741
01:24:17,979 --> 01:24:22,783
We got some quick formalities
we need to see to.

742
01:24:23,818 --> 01:24:28,591
I ain't been down here but twice
in my life. Takes a mean gut.

743
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:31,689
There's something I want you to see.

744
01:24:41,302 --> 01:24:45,073
Nothin' this past week made any sense.

745
01:24:45,173 --> 01:24:49,444
And then last night,
I woke up with the dumbest epiphany.

746
01:24:49,545 --> 01:24:52,515
There's your slap-dash video

747
01:24:52,614 --> 01:24:56,250
of Georgie gettin' two in the chest.

748
01:24:58,185 --> 01:25:02,024
So if my imagination wanders,
I could piece together a situation

749
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:07,194
where this is all part of a ruse gone bad,
what with the reward money and all.

750
01:25:08,296 --> 01:25:10,833
And folks with that kind
of imagination, I bet,

751
01:25:10,934 --> 01:25:13,167
could fair well if they stayed honest.

752
01:25:19,608 --> 01:25:22,643
Slide this under his back.

753
01:25:32,421 --> 01:25:37,137
I know that I ain't very clever.
My expertise is in the simple.

754
01:25:37,238 --> 01:25:40,496
And that ain't for everybody either.
Sometimes in life,

755
01:25:41,395 --> 01:25:43,631
the truth...

756
01:25:43,731 --> 01:25:47,184
is more than I prefer.

757
01:25:47,668 --> 01:25:49,738
This is one of those times.

758
01:25:49,838 --> 01:25:54,243
If you need to leave,
you ought to have left already.

759
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:57,087
Waitin' around for lucky money,

760
01:25:57,188 --> 01:26:01,082
that's for sallies and lazies.

761
01:26:01,182 --> 01:26:04,719
The price for this, you gonna
be passing on that reward money.

762
01:26:06,822 --> 01:26:09,914
And I'm firin' you.

763
01:26:10,625 --> 01:26:14,127
Severance will keep you
afloat for a spell.

764
01:26:17,364 --> 01:26:20,533
- I'll pay you back, sir.
- You're damn right.

765
01:26:21,636 --> 01:26:24,340
Me and Roland,
we'll take care of your daddy.

766
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:28,676
It's about time you had some family
around here helpin' you out.

767
01:26:28,777 --> 01:26:31,447
Reckon you wouldn't get this kind
of pass in the big city,

768
01:26:31,546 --> 01:26:33,514
and you best not ever need it again.

769
01:26:35,783 --> 01:26:39,453
And not a word to Cassandra about this.

770
01:26:57,171 --> 01:27:00,739
First time I ever used my vest.

771
01:27:17,792 --> 01:27:21,795
Overwhelmingly glad to see you.
Oh, there he is.

772
01:27:23,564 --> 01:27:27,268
- You go ahead, sir.
- Thank you, Sheriff Vogel.

773
01:27:38,006 --> 01:27:39,979
Wait! Wait!

774
01:28:18,323 --> 01:28:25,354
<i>It was colder than well digger's ankles
in Cut Bank, Montana</i>

775
01:28:28,305 --> 01:28:35,426
<i>But my heart was on fire
when I saw her step down from the train</i>

776
01:28:37,738 --> 01:28:40,828
<i>I'd been up there forever</i>

777
01:28:40,927 --> 01:28:46,176
<i>But her arms were finally around me</i>

778
01:28:47,850 --> 01:28:55,313
<i>All my icicles melted away
at the sound of her name</i>

779
01:28:58,207 --> 01:29:05,507
<i>I held her to me
as tightly as I held her letter</i>

780
01:29:08,064 --> 01:29:11,126
<i>That said, "I don't love him,</i>

781
01:29:11,586 --> 01:29:15,631
<i>I'm leaving this cold, mean man"</i>

782
01:29:17,958 --> 01:29:25,386
<i>As the train pulled away from the platform
and I put her in the wagon</i>

783
01:29:27,761 --> 01:29:35,060
<i>With her head on my shoulder,
God knows I was one happy man</i>

784
01:29:38,117 --> 01:29:45,264
<i>And I went to heaven that night
in her arms in my cabin</i>

785
01:29:47,699 --> 01:29:55,082
<i>In the winter of '94
there burned such a powerful flame</i>

786
01:29:58,007 --> 01:30:02,634
<i>They still hear her voice in the cabin</i>

787
01:30:02,734 --> 01:30:06,039
<i>In Cut Bank, Montana</i>

788
01:30:07,752 --> 01:30:15,011
<i>And the icicles all melt away
at the sound of her name</i>

789
01:30:17,570 --> 01:30:24,936
<i>Hell rolled into town one night
on a Wyoming stallion</i>

790
01:30:27,698 --> 01:30:35,252
<i>His heart full of hate
and his eyes full of cold jealousy</i>

791
01:30:38,371 --> 01:30:40,322
<i>One way or another</i>

792
01:30:40,421 --> 01:30:44,600
<i>He said partner I'm taking back my woman</i>

793
01:30:47,144 --> 01:30:50,676
<i>With my hand on my gun
I said don't bet your life</i>

794
01:30:50,777 --> 01:30:54,787
<i>The lady said she's staying with me</i>

795
01:30:57,676 --> 01:31:04,814
<i>His knife was a flash in the light
of the kerosene lantern</i>

796
01:31:07,451 --> 01:31:14,560
<i>That fell as we tangled
and fought in the fire on the floor</i>

797
01:31:17,793 --> 01:31:24,981
<i>He was a dead man,
but I have been too since I lost her</i>

798
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:34,484
<i>From the fire that burned me so bad
as I crawled through the door</i>

799
01:31:37,466 --> 01:31:44,600
<i>But I went to heaven that night
in her arms in my little cabin</i>

800
01:31:47,052 --> 01:31:54,234
<i>In the winter of '94
there burned one hell of a flame</i>

801
01:31:57,532 --> 01:32:01,935
<i>They still hear her voice from the cabin</i>

802
01:32:02,036 --> 01:32:05,542
<i>In Cut Bank, Montana</i>

803
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:14,268

<i>In Cut Bank, Montana</i>

806

<i>And the icicles all just melt away</i>

807
01:32:30,787 --> 01:32:35,869
<i>At the sound of her name</i>
