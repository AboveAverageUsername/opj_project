2
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:54,299
Malo sunca.
-Gledaj!

3
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,217
Bok, Zarina!

4
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:03,207
Si ostala bez vilinske
prašine, šeæeru?

5
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,643
Znaš mene, Rosetta.

6
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:09,439
Mogla bih ti dati neke savjete
kako da oèuvaš svoje zalihe.

7
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,818
Možda æu upravo
tako i uèiniti, Dessa.

8
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:21,367
Vila, èuvarica prašine kojoj
uvijek ponestane vilinske prašine.

9
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:23,369
Ironièno, zar ne?

10
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,507
Ispiranje!
Sušenje!

11
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,511
Bok, Z! Krila u redu?

12
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:43,431
Samo uživam u šetnji.
Ali hvala, Fawn.

13
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:44,849
Lijep vjetar, Vidia.

14
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:47,810
Hvala. Èemu ta šetnja?

15
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:50,605
O, ne!

16
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:44,117
Stavile smo prašine u vreæe
i one ostaju tamo, zar ne?

17
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:47,895
Pa ipak, mi posipamo
prašinu iznad neèega,

18
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:49,313
i ona lebdi.

19
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:54,460
Pa, to je naèin na koji
ova prašina radi.

20
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,631
Da, znam, ali zašto?
To je pitanje?

21
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,553
Znate na što mislim?
Èak ni malo?

22
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,497
Nijednom niste pomislile?
-Dobro jutro,

23
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:10,667
èuvarice prašine! -Dobro jutro!

24
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,562
Dobro, da vidimo.

25
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:16,482
Na dužnosti plave prašine
danas imamo...

26
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,401
Gdje smo ono?
-Y.

27
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:20,802
O, da! Yvette.

28
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,846
Yvette nije ovdje danas,
vilenjaèe Gary.

29
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:25,140
Ponovno joj je natekao lakat.

30
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:27,076
To je fantastièno!

31
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:33,624
Mislim, jadna, jadna Yvette.

32
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:37,462
Pa, reko, to nas dovodi do...

33
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:44,302
Zarina, tvoj je red!

34
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:52,000
Možete li vjerovati? Mislim, jedan
dan ranije. To je tako uzbudljivo!

35
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:55,563
Šest okreta u desno.
-Da, hvala ti.

36
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,486
Opa.
-Pažljivo sad!

37
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,137
Nakon zadnjeg puta,
Sigurno te ne moram podsjeæati

38
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,555
koliko je moæan i snažan...

39
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:08,493
Bez dodirivanjea, obeæajem.
Moja cura!

40
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:12,354
U redu, onda. Toèno 26 toèkica.

41
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:16,316
Ali zašto 26?
-Evo nas opet. -Zašto ne 25?

42
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:19,236
Što bi se dogodilo kad
bi ih recimo stavili, 27?

43
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:21,923
Stavljamo 26.
-Ali zašto?

44
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:26,284
Zarina, ti si najznatiželjnija vila
koju sam ikada upoznao.

45
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,179
Ispravak, to je veza.

46
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:31,832
Ajmo reæi, da si ti
Zvonèica u èuvaricama prašine.

47
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,001
No zašto si to rekao
kao da je loša stvar?

48
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:36,979
Zato što mi ne radimo sa
granèicama i šišarkama.

49
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:40,900
Mi radimo sa vilinskom prašinom.
To je naša žila kucavica.

50
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:43,194
Nema mjesta pogreškama.

51
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,750
Plava prašina.

52
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:01,629
Jedan od prirodnih
najmoænijih množitelja.

53
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:06,592
To vodi zlatnu prašinu
od kapanja do buèanja.

54
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:12,598
Koliko god puta da sam to vidjela
još uvijek...

55
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:14,142
Upravo to.

56
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:17,961
U redu, ali ako imamo plavu prašinu,
zašto tamo ne bi bile druge boje?

57
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:19,212
Zato što nisu.

58
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:22,132
I možda bi te druge boje
radile druge stvari.

59
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:25,927
Što ako bi bila,
Ne znam, ljubièasta?

60
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,530
Što da je roza?

61
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,349
Na dan kad netko pronaðe
rozu vilinsku prašinu

62
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,704
je dan kad æu ja obuæi
hlaèe umjesto kilta.

63
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,748
Recimo, da je ne naðemo?
Nego da je napravimo.

64
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:40,376
Slušaj me pažljivo, Zarina.

65
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,588
Mi se ne poigravamo
sa vilinskom prašinom.

66
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:46,865
To je previše moæno.
-Ali ako to ne uèinimo,

67
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:48,992
nikada neæemo saznati
što sve može uèiniti.

68
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:51,846
To nije naš posao.
Mi smo èuvari prašine.

69
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,808
Mi njegujemo prašinu, održavamo je,

70
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,935
izmjeravamo je, pakiramo je,

71
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,188
i distribuiramo je.

72
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:04,341
Lijepa tradicija,
iz dana u dan,

73
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:06,444
prenošena se jedne generacije...

74
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:10,323
na sljedeæu... pa opet i tako to.

75
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:16,871
O ne! Vilenjaèe Gary!

76
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,165
Jeste li dobro?

77
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,460
Tehnièki, nisam
ništa ni pipnula ovaj put.

78
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:24,170
Èep.

79
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:29,717
Daj mi da budem potpuno jasan, Zarina.

80
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:34,055
Èuvarima prašine je zabranjeno
prtljati s vilinskom prašinom.

81
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,163
Bez rezultata.

82
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,916
Bez rezultata.

83
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,710
Bez rezultata.

84
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,727
Two parts sunflower seed,
a dash of moonflower.

85
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,267
It worked!

86
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:07,380
Oh! Hey, Zarina!
#What brings you... -Tinker Bell...

87
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,716
...here? -Remember how you were
the first one to use lost things,

88
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:11,635
and everyone thought
you were kind of crazy?

89
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:13,970
I believe Fairy Mary
called them "junk."

90
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:18,117
Exactly! But now, even she uses them
and tinkering is better than ever.

91
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:20,977
Well, that's nice of...
#And remember how you crossed the Winter border

92
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:24,147
when you knew it wasn't allowed,
but you just had to anyway?

93
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:27,001
I like to think it was
more of a grey area.

94
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,795
Good. Now, keep that in mind.
-Whoa!

95
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:32,864
You...

96
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:36,969
You're bending light.
You're bending light?

97
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:40,205
But you're not a Light Fairy.
You're a Dust Keeper.

98
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:43,517
Amazing, right?
#Uh, but, how?

99
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:47,545
Whoa!
You found orange pixie dust?

100
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,941
No, Tink. I made
orange pixie dust.

101
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,652
That's never been done before.

102
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:57,114
Exactly! I knew you'd understand.

103
00:09:57,473 --> 00:10:01,535
Now, I can finally figure out
everything pixie dust is capable of.

104
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,853
Oh, what does Fairy Gary
think about all this?

105
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:08,000
He doesn't exactly know.
-What?

106
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:10,795
He doesn't really think
we should tamper with pixie dust.

107
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,881
Do you mind stirring?
-Uh, okay.

108
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,134
I guess he thinks it's
just too powerful.

109
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,261
Oh! You can't stop.
-Oh! Uh...

110
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:25,792
Is that blue dust?
#You're doing this with blue dust?

111
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:29,230
Yes, and it just takes the
tiniest bit. #Can you believe it?

112
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:30,981
Back up a little.
-Uh...

113
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:39,490
Wow.
-Purple pixie dust.

114
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:43,536
Wind!

115
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:49,482
Purple equals fast-flying talent!

116
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:55,989
Garden talent next! -Uh...
#Zarina? -Pink pixie dust...

117
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,658
Maybe you should, you know,
slow down a bit.

118
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,095
Five pieces of petal
for every three drops of extract.

119
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,808
Uh, should it be bubbling like that?
-Mmm-hmm.

120
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,256
Two? This time you're adding two?

121
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,654
Zarina! Are you okay?

122
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:23,033
Tinker Fairy Gary some trousers,
because I just made pink pixie dust.

123
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,828
Zarina, this seems
kind of dangerous.

124
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:29,498
Do you know what this means, Tink?
I've finally found my "lost things."

125
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:32,776
Dust-keeping will change forever!
#Zarina, I really think you should stop!

126
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:34,712
What?

127
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:50,019
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no.

128
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:52,837
Whoa! Look out!

129
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:11,248
Oh, no!
#No!

130
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,129
Oh, no!

131
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,614
No...

132
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,333
How did this happen?

133
00:12:56,485 --> 00:13:00,280
Oh, no!
#What happened?

134
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:02,365
Tink, are you okay?
-Oh, my.

135
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:04,534
Yeah.
-Who grew these?

136
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:13,585
I'm so sorry. I'll help
rebuild the depot.

137
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:15,086
I'll come in early, I'll stay late!

138
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:19,316
You were told not
to tamper with pixie dust.

139
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:23,571
I think it's best
if you don't come in at all.

140
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,408
What are you saying?

141
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,995
You are no longer a Dust Keeper.

142
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,915
It's simply too dangerous.

143
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:40,045
We'll start rebuilding in
the morning, Queen Clarion.

144
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,300
<i>Welcome one, welcome all</i>

145
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,737
<i>to the Four Seasons Festival!</i>

146
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:50,890
<i>Tonight, every talent
from every season will gather together</i>

147
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:54,203
<i>to celebrate all the realms
of Pixie Hollow.</i>

148
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,106
Wow! Can you believe it?
#Everyone in Pixie Hollow is here!

149
00:14:58,107 --> 00:15:01,025
It's so great to have
the Winter Fairies join us.

150
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,336
I'll say it is.

151
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:05,488
It's enough to give you the vapors.

152
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:10,469
Tinker Bell, don't you Tinkers
ever stop tinkering?

153
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:15,599
Can't seem to get
this latch to open!

154
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:19,210
It had better not stick like that
for our grand finale.

155
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:22,231
Is it starting?
-No, that's just Clank.

156
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,737
The thing is pretty
loud, eh, Bobble?

157
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:33,075
Indeed, my bugling buddy.
#Sure makes me thirsty, though.

158
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:37,955
It's starting!

159
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,488
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Bobble...

160
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:51,159
Oh, no! Already?
#Hold these!

161
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,596
But the show just started!
#Ask them to wait!

162
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:02,896
Hey, guys, I can't see!

163
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:07,800
Oh! It's Periwinkle!
#Beautiful. -Oh, look at that.

164
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:08,986
Hi, Peri!

165
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,322
That's my sister.

166
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,374
All right!

167
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:40,225
Yeah! -Yay! #Go, fairies!

168
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:43,562
R0, did you do those?
That wasn't in rehearsal.

169
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:45,606
Wasn't me.

170
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:49,193
I never work with poppies.
The pollen makes me sleepy.

171
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:51,820
Wait. Is that...

172
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,866
Zarina?
#Zarina? -Hmm.

173
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:59,161
She's back?
#What's with that wild hair?

174
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:05,024
Oh, look at those flowers!

175
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:09,404
Spring must be next!
That's my favorite.

176
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:11,322
Oh, I hope Clanky doesn't miss it.

177
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:31,485
Oh, lovely! Oh!

178
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:34,780
Guys, guys! We gotta hide!
-Oh!

179
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,198
Now, now, now!

180
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,853
They've really outdone
themselves this year.

181
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,958
What a show.

182
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:19,700
Excuse me. Sorry.
Yes, me again. Coming through.

183
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:23,675
No, no, don't get up.
#Oh, sorry, I should have flown.

184
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,957
Thank you, Bobble.
-What did I miss?

185
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,102
Wake up!
#Wake up!

186
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,670
Please! Anyone?

187
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:52,357
Clank, help us! Down here!

188
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:56,385
Clank!
#In here! In the box! -Oh! Oh, oh...

189
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,572
Ms. Bell?
-Help, we're stuck.

190
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,949
Right. How does it open?

191
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,285
Push the button!

192
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,978
Thank you so much.

193
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,206
You've got to see this.

194
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:14,796
Oh, no.

195
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,909
Are they...
-No. Goodness, no.

196
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:25,349
They're in a deep sleep.
#For how long?

197
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:27,768
At least a couple of days.

198
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,437
Why would Zarina do this?

199
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,564
Clank, did you see her?

200
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,608
No, no.

201
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,904
Yes, yes, I saw her
flying towards the dust depot.

202
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:45,268
The blue pixie dust.
#Ooh, this is bad.

203
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,435
Uh, yeah.

204
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,647
Without it, the tree
can't make pixie dust.

205
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:52,376
And if the tree
can't make pixie dust...

206
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:55,653
We can't fly.
#On! Can't... Can't fly...

207
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:57,113
Deep breaths.
-Can't fly...

208
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:59,782
Okay. Okay.
-That's it. Deep breaths.

209
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,785
What could she want it for?

210
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,389
I don't know. But we
have to find her.

211
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:09,584
Clank, stay here and watch
over everyone. #I'm on it.

212
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:13,271
Especially the Winter Fairies.
#Make sure they get a steady stream of snow.

213
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:14,815
Right!

214
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,609
Right.

215
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,865
The blue dust has a strong glow.
If we can just spot it...

216
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,206
There!

217
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,462
Whoa, she's moving fast!

218
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,216
Oh, sorry!

219
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,661
Where is all this fog coming from?

220
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,973
It's mist. We must be
getting near the coast.

221
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:51,018
We're losing her!

222
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:53,353
Over there!

223
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,943
Oh, my!
#Oh, no.

224
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:10,937
It's...
#Pirates.

225
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:13,081
Great, now there's pirates.

226
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:16,734
Maybe they're nice pirates.
#Right.

227
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:19,987
They must have captured her,
forced her to take the dust.

228
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:23,324
Well, we have to rescue her.
#But they're...

229
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:26,577
Deep breaths. Deep
breaths.

230
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:27,745
Okay.
-Hmm.

231
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,875
Magnificent!
-Quite right.

232
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:34,644
A fine haul.

233
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,439
We got their blue dust!

234
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,632
Well, it's not theirs anymore.

235
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:42,134
It is theirs no longer.

236
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:45,054
I just said that,
you daft potato muncher.

237
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:47,974
Potato...
#They're holding her in the bottom of the boat.

238
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:51,394
You've got a right wee brain,
you know that? #Still smart enough

239
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:54,122
to know we got their dust!

240
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:58,734
Let me just say that your plan
worked perfectly, Captain.

241
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:03,239
"Captain"?
#Here's to perfect plans.

242
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,300
Ave! Perfect!

243
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:09,346
Guess she doesn't need rescuing.
#But now the hair makes sense.

244
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:10,889
What do we do now?

245
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:13,600
Let's just get the dust
and get out of here.

246
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:16,335
A little bit of pillage,
a little bit of plunder.

247
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,527
Fairies!

248
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:29,491
Get her! Get her!

249
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:36,605
Got it.
#Here! -She's getting away!

250
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:38,458
They took the blue dust!

251
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:41,086
Captain!

252
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,884
Give me back that dust!
#Zarina, why are you doing this?

253
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,761
Fawn!

254
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:54,999
If you give it to me,
I'll give you quarter.

255
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,961
Quarter? I think we need all of it.
#"Quarter" means mercy!

256
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:02,774
This dust belongs to Pixie Hollow.

257
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,943
You had your chance.

258
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:23,211
Wake up.

259
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,130
Tink, wake up.

260
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,034
What happened?

261
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:33,930
The last thing I remember was
Zarina throwing that dust at us.

262
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:39,060
Your dress.
#I know. Um...

263
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:46,026
Is everyone all right?
#I guess so.

264
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,029
I'm not. Look at my outfit!

265
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:52,139
Orange is not my color.
#She's right.

266
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,101
Listen, we have to get out of here
and go after Zarina.

267
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:56,745
Silvermist, can you part the...

268
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:02,417
Shut it Off! Shut it Off!
#I didn't do anything. I just...

269
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:04,044
Tink!

270
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:07,238
Tink, could you stop
not doing anything?

271
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:10,074
It's okay, I got this.
#Whoa!

272
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,952
Silvermist, are you okay?
#Whoa!

273
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,705
That's weird.
Here, let me help you.

274
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,644
It's so bright!
#Bright! -Fawn, I can't see!

275
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:25,714
What did you do? -I don't
know. #Ew, ew, ew, ew.

276
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:28,634
Get them off. Get them off!
Get them off! #Get them off!

277
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:31,863
Wait a minute.
#Do you realize what this means?

278
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:35,951
Oh, my gosh!
Zarina switched our heads!

279
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:39,854
No. No, no, no.
#She switched our talents.

280
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:43,667
Excuse me? -What? #I
must be a Water Fairy now.

281
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,627
Oh, so, that's why
your dress is blue.

282
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:48,112
And I guess you're a
Fast-Flying Fairy.

283
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:50,548
I'm a... I'm a Light Fairy.

284
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,636
Garden Fairy!
-Oh.

285
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:58,664
Looks like I'm an
Animal Fairy now. Huh.

286
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,016
Lucky me.

287
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:03,061
No, no, no, it can't be.

288
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:06,255
You're a...
-Don't say it.

289
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:09,526
Tinker Bell, take these things
back right now!

290
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:11,010
Okay.

291
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:13,571
Tinker.

292
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:16,574
Guys, come on,
we gotta get out of here.

293
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:20,662
Well, you're the Water Fairy.
Part the waters.

294
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:25,375
Um, use both hands this time.

295
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:29,504
Well, you don't see that every day.

296
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:33,675
You guys better hurry!
I can't hold it!

297
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:51,342
Guys, are you...

298
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:58,116
.â€œokay?
#Yeah.

299
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:00,785
Guys, I think I broke something.

300
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:05,248
Whoa!

301
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,859
Nice, little, harmless,

302
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,504
sharp-toothed, hungry croco...

303
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:17,260
dile.
#Fawn!

304
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,495
It's okay. When babies are born,

305
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,973
they imprint on the
first thing they see.

306
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:26,794
Uh, guys, sorry to interrupt
whatever that is,

307
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:30,440
but the pirate ship is gone.
#What? -Oh, no.

308
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:34,110
Sil, Fast Flyer, check it out.
#Oh, yeah.

309
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:43,703
Where is she?

310
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:49,042
You guys, I saw it, up the coast!
Let's go!

311
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:56,716
Oh, right, you can't fly.
#Wet wings.

312
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:59,594
Still, there's got to
be a way to... Ah!

313
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:03,014
Excuse me, Ro.

314
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,642
Hmm. Structurally sound enough.

315
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,852
Strength-to-weight
ratio seems good.

316
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,087
If I had some rope...

317
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,651
You're thinking like a Tinker.

318
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:19,489
Okay, fine.
#Get me some vines.

319
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,890
Not a problem.

320
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,912
Will these do?

321
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:32,502
Okay, ready?
#Wait for me!

322
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:38,174
Sorry. Gotta...
#Can I please have that?

323
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:40,593
Oh!
Go!

324
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,857
There's the pirate ship!

325
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:58,135
You can slow down now!

326
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:00,697
Easy for you to say.

327
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:03,741
Hold on!

328
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:12,066
Well, at least our wings are dry.
#Yeah.

329
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:15,879
Twenty-one gun salute to
the captain! #Right, 21.

330
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:21,176
Nice boom!
-Oh, yes! Nice!

331
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,349
Music to my ear!
#That's right!

332
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:31,126
Encore!
#Beautiful!

333
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:32,770
Yes, yes, yes!

334
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,273
Cease fire!

335
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:38,151
What? Cease fire?
What for?

336
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:39,819
That was only seven.

337
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:43,865
I say 21.

338
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:47,643
Right!

339
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:52,165
Twenty-one, obviously, on the
metric system, which is fine.

340
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:55,084
Come on,
we've got to find that dust.

341
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:58,529
If I may, good sirs, I believe

342
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,216
the proper acknowledgment
would be a toast.

343
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:04,385
A toast it is!

344
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,787
Now, there is a good cabin boy.

345
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:10,749
A beautiful suggestion.
#Quite thirsty, myself. -Uh-uh!

346
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,353
If it pleases the captain.

347
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:21,135
You tell those scurvy
scallywags that...

348
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:26,115
What did she say?
#She said, it does!

349
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:30,811
What is better
than a good mug of grog?

350
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,497
Two mugs!

351
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:36,960
Your tea, Captain. Earl Grey, hot.

352
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:39,379
Please, sir, may I have some more?

353
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:42,173
To our cunning captain.

354
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,717
Okay, you gotta love the boots.

355
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,970
Just one year ago,
we'd lost everything.

356
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:50,223
Our ship turned adrift, and then

357
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:53,333
we found her.

358
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:58,147
Exactly. We needed a captain.

359
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:01,467
And when we humbly asked
if she could make us fly...

360
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,427
She didn't stop there.

361
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:07,139
No! She did one better, she did.
#Better indeed!

362
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,684
Soon, she's going to
make the whole ship fly!

363
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:11,894
To flying!

364
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:17,107
<i>Fly?
#First the Tower of London, arr!</i>

365
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:18,793
<i>The guards won't know what hit it</i>

366
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,153
<i>We'll swoop right down
and take the crown</i>

367
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:24,907
<i>And the Crown Jewels with it
And when we fly to Paris</i>

368
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:27,135
<i>Oh, the treasures I'll be grabbin'</i>

369
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:29,411
<i>The Mona Lisa will look lovely</i>

370
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:32,623
<i>Hanging in me cabin
Hey-ho</i>

371
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:36,477
<i>Imagine the places that we'll go
No one can stop us When we're so</i>

372
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,439
<i>High in the stratosphere!</i>

373
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:42,424
<i>Hey-ho
We'll be the freighter that plunders</i>

374
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:45,677
<i>Every one of the world's seven
wonders When we're up in the skies</i>

375
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,780
<i>For who can fight a
frigate that flies?</i>

376
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:51,659
<i>No one can fight a
frigate that flies</i>

377
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:55,705
<i>Next we'll roam to Rome, me lads
And here's what I'll be stealin'</i>

378
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:57,731
<i>I'll rob the Sistine Chapel</i>

379
00:30:57,732 --> 00:30:59,834
<i>Of the Sistine Chapel's cieilin'</i>

380
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:03,796
<i>And for all the folks in Egypt
It will be a dismal day</i>

381
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:06,031
<i>They'll be crying for their mummies</i>

382
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:09,368
<i>When we take their mummies away!
Hey-ho</i>

383
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,304
<i>Imagine the places that we'll go</i>

384
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,931
<i>No can stop us when we're so high!</i>

385
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:16,392
<i>They will all cower in fear</i>

386
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:19,419
<i>Hey-ho, from Delhi to Rio to Venice</i>

387
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,798
<i>There's no city that we will not
menace When we're up in the skies</i>

388
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,841
<i>For who can fight a
frigate that flies?</i>

389
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:28,845
<i>No one can fight a
frigate that flies</i>

390
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:32,325
<i>Oh, how high we will be!
-We will be</i>

391
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:36,144
<i>'Cause the blue fairy dust
Surely packs a mighty wallop</i>

392
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,563
<i>Only takes a dollop</i>

393
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:40,500
<i>Soon it will set us free
-We'll be free</i>

394
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:42,752
<i>From the chains of gravity</i>

395
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:45,028
<i>Then we'll hoist up the sail</i>

396
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:48,949
<i>And we'll set course for the sun
'Cause when you've got wings</i>

397
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,243
<i>No wicked deed cannot be done</i>

398
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:53,036
<i>And we owe it all</i>

399
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:56,891
<i>To our great and glorious captain</i>

400
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:59,376
Although, now that you mention it,

401
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:02,814
why are we taking orders
from some fairy, anyway?

402
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:08,319
Heh, heh, heh...
#Two, three, four!

403
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:11,239
<i>Hey-ho, imagine the
places that we'll go</i>

404
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,765
<i>No one can stop us
when we're so high</i>

405
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:16,577
<i>Givin' a pirate cheer
Arr!</i>

406
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:19,396
<i>Hey-ho, we'll be
the freighter that plunders</i>

407
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:22,774
<i>Every one of the world's seven
wonders When we're up in the skies</i>

408
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,836
<i>For who can fight a
frigate that flies?</i>

409
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:27,463
<i>Hey-ho, there's not
a town or a county</i>

410
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,425
<i>That will not yield its bounty up</i>

411
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,927
<i>When our ship draws near</i>

412
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:36,038
<i>Hey-ho, there's not
a city or village</i>

413
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:39,249
<i>That we will not plunder or pillage
When we're up in the skies</i>

414
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,935
<i>For who can fight a
frigate that flies?</i>

415
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:45,398
<i>And every nation
will give a donation</i>

416
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:48,675
<i>When they see us sail the skies</i>

417
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:51,970
<i>In a frigate that flies!
Hey!</i>

418
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:18,246
Whoa.
-Tink.

419
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:23,102
It looks like...

420
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:25,462
The Pixie Dust Tree back home.

421
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:27,273
Zarina must have grown it.

422
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,525
So, that's how they're
going to fly.

423
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:32,195
She's going to make pixie dust.

424
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:37,533
Ahoy, you biscuit-eating
bilge rats!

425
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:42,312
Prepare to dock starboard!
#Docking starboard!

426
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:45,023
Captain says, raise the sails
and step lively!

427
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:48,151
Raise the sails!
#Heave!

428
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:50,755
Bring her around, Mr. Yang!

429
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:53,883
Bringing her around!

430
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,665
Let go anchor! -Let go anchor! #Get
out all lines! -Get out all lines!

431
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:03,166
Casting lines!

432
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:06,854
Come on, get moving.
-Are you talking to me?

433
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:10,298
Captain says, restock the ship.
#We set sail at dawn.

434
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,944
Yes, Captain.
Load ship, right away.

435
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,989
Hey, watch where you're swinging
that thing! #Work faster, now!

436
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:20,660
That's it!
#Come on.

437
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,816
Locked.
#Come on, you lubber, get on with it.

438
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:30,110
Someone's coming!
#Pirate!

439
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:31,462
Hide!

440
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:40,412
Animal Fairy, you're up.

441
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:44,141
Excuse me, mouse. Uh...

442
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:48,187
Mr. Mouse.
#Would you mind terribly moving on?

443
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:50,422
We need this space to
do a little hiding.

444
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:56,678
Much obliged.
#Bye-bye!

445
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,823
Aw, what a cute little mouse.

446
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,867
It was a rat.

447
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,494
Hey, shoo, rat!

448
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:12,295
Uh, permission to enter, Captain.
#This is our chance.

449
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:14,463
Now!

450
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:17,258
No!

451
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,177
I had Oppenheimer
make you your favorite.

452
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:23,139
The dust.

453
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:26,541
I know how much you like a little
something sweet while you work.

454
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,896
Well, you're quite welcome.

455
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:34,191
Uh, yes, of course. Sorry.

456
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:36,569
Ah, right, second drawer.

457
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,659
Look at that.

458
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:46,871
It sparkles like a
thousand sapphires.

459
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:51,167
You're quite the little genius.

460
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:56,172
It's hard to believe the other fairies
didn't appreciate your talent.

461
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:59,717
Sil?
-She looks seasick.

462
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:04,347
This never happened
when I was a Water Fairy.

463
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:08,083
You know, I remember when I couldn't
understand a single jingle. -Oh, no!

464
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,443
I'm fine.

465
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:24,867
Fawn!

466
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:30,230
Sorry!
-What are you doing?

467
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:33,066
What Dess does.
-That's not what I do.

468
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:34,359
Well, stop it!

469
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,088
You shouldn't take
light so lightly.

470
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,426
What?
-What, what? What?

471
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:44,637
No, nothing, nothing!

472
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,065
It's still so hard to believe that
this blue dust can make flying dust.

473
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:58,943
Yes, but only if you...

474
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:05,866
So, the secret is the infusion of the
blue dust directly into the tree.

475
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:09,829
You okay?
#Start throwing out the line.

476
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:12,397
All right, Tink, open the drawer
as much as you can.

477
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:16,318
So, once the golden dust has been
produced... #Sil, hold the line.

478
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:18,445
The sluice will coat the
ship with the perfect amount,

479
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:21,799
and at that point,
we take to the skies!

480
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,928
Very impressive, Captain.

481
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,557
No pirate I know could
have imagined such a scheme.

482
00:37:33,002 --> 00:37:34,210
Oh.
-Vidia!

483
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:37,523
You've turned out to be quite
the pint-sized prodigy,

484
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,774
if I may say.

485
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:42,820
It's been an adventure
and an honor.

486
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:45,364
Your sword, Captain.

487
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:59,569
Y'all okay?
#Yeah. They're headed for the tree.

488
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,447
Come on!
#Whoa! What is up with your...

489
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:05,200
Hey, hey, we should
catch up with Tink.

490
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:09,472
All right, just give me the strap.

491
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:12,040
That's it, hold it in place.

492
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:14,810
Right, watch the
angle of the flume.

493
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:18,421
Too much pitch, and she'll
overflow. #Aye aye, Captain!

494
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:20,465
Make sure the seams are sealed.

495
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:24,344
Captain doesn't want to lose a
single grain of that precious dust.

496
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:26,030
Oh, that golden dust.

497
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:33,103
Dess! Quiet!

498
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:35,873
Sorry. I barely touched it.

499
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:37,691
Well, don't touch it at all.

500
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:41,629
Just hover. -Yeah, hover.
#All right, all right.

501
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:49,011
As soon as she's gone, we'll grab
the dust and get out of here.

502
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:51,329
Maybe we should try
and talk to her.

503
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,975
Yeah, because that worked out
so well back at the waterfall.

504
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,383
Hey, shoo.
#Hey!

505
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:09,031
Hey, hey, hey...
#Go, go, go!

506
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,742
Oh, no. No!
No, no, no, no, no!

507
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:14,120
Stop growing. Stop growing.
Please, branch, no!

508
00:39:19,525 --> 00:39:23,445
We 9011 you!
#Did you really think by switching our talents,

509
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:26,948
you could beat us?
#Looks that way.

510
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:29,635
Got them!
#Zarina!

511
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:34,140
Well done. Got them all
in one swell foop, I did.

512
00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:40,170
Zarina, don't do this.

513
00:39:40,171 --> 00:39:42,982
Come back with us. Come back home.

514
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:50,447
I'll never go back to Pixie Hollow.

515
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:52,307
You don't belong here.

516
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:55,035
This is exactly where
I belong, Tink.

517
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:57,955
We appreciate what she can do.

518
00:39:58,022 --> 00:40:00,040
We treasure it, actually.

519
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:06,505
Put them below,
and keep your eye on them.

520
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:09,508
Oh, right.
Maybe I'll use, uh, this one?

521
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:11,635
While you still have it.

522
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:15,806
Captain, are you all right?

523
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:21,770
Captain says, back
to work, gentlemen.

524
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:24,273
All righty, mates, you heard him.

525
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:30,678
And, right.
#Perfect fit.

526
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:33,181
Welcome to your new cabin.

527
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:36,643
Oh.
#Me stock is ready.

528
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:44,859
Oh, well, now, look at that.
-Oh, lovely.

529
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,694
Oh, that is good
eating right there.

530
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:49,089
Isn't it, Mum?
"Yes, it is, darling."

531
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,844
Oh, let me see.
What shall I make tonight?

532
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:57,705
Well, I've still got some lard
and some old cabbage.

533
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:00,434
Okay, we need a plan.

534
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:08,275
Here we go.

535
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:33,008
Ah! -Oh! #It worked!

536
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,761
Yes, she did it!
-It worked!

537
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:38,222
it's working!
-Pixie dust!

538
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:41,892
Look at it! Amazing!

539
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,770
We're going to fly!

540
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:48,089
From a trickle to a roar.

541
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,276
Fly like a happy bird!

542
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:53,487
Cold gruel, with a
little bit of sawdust.

543
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:56,490
A dash of rodent,
sauteed of course.

544
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:58,701
Some carrots? No.

545
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:01,269
Hey, where you think
you're going, little fella?

546
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:06,608
Now is our chance. Go, go, go, go!
#Come on, all together.

547
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:08,252
I'm going as fast as I can!

548
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:11,880
Oh, not today, my darlings.

549
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:15,801
Would you be kind enough
to hold this for me?

550
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:17,720
Perfect.

551
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,931
Anybody else got an idea?

552
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:26,878
Absolutely astonishing.

553
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:30,840
Just imagine, flying like a bird.

554
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:35,112
Of course,
you do that all the time.

555
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:38,824
What's it like?
How do you even steer?

556
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:41,285
It's pretty simple, actually.
Lean left.

557
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:44,455
Lean right, fly right.

558
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:54,757
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

559
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:59,053
This is...

560
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:02,598
Are you afraid?
#Hmm?

561
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:06,101
Afraid?
#Lead on, Captain.

562
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:20,199
Oh, I'm doing it.
#I'm...

563
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:22,368
I'm flying!

564
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:25,454
Look out, mates!

565
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:28,835
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Look at him go.

566
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:31,835
What's so funny? Whoa!
Whoa, whoa...

567
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:35,464
You can't fly like that.
Put your legs together.

568
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:07,996
Just try to keep up.

569
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:20,783
Ave ave, Captain!
#The lad is flying!

570
00:44:23,871 --> 00:44:26,890
It works! It really works.

571
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:30,335
And pretty soon, we'll have enough
dust to make the whole ship fly.

572
00:44:30,336 --> 00:44:32,104
Right, Zarina?

573
00:44:32,755 --> 00:44:37,008
And as long as we have the blue dust,
we'll never run out of flying dust.

574
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:39,403
Right again?
-Right again, James.

575
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:45,492
Well, then, we won't
need you anymore.

576
00:44:48,604 --> 00:44:51,165
Our plan worked perfectly.

577
00:44:52,024 --> 00:44:54,650
Fairies are such
gullible creatures.

578
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:56,253
Aren't they, lads?

579
00:44:57,112 --> 00:45:00,239
No match for an Eton education
such as mine.

580
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,532
He's a smart one, isn't he?

581
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:04,619
The power of the pixie dust
is finally ours.

582
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:10,708
We've had enough kissing up
to that pint-sized prima donna.

583
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:14,045
No quarter for her.
#Let's make her walk a tiny little plank.

584
00:45:14,046 --> 00:45:15,713
Yes, tiny!
-A tiny plank!

585
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:18,317
She can fly, you cretins.

586
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:21,427
Oh! -You know, he's right.
#That is why he is the captain.

587
00:45:21,428 --> 00:45:24,490
<i>She'd just fly away. I get it.
#Mi capitan.</i>

588
00:45:24,515 --> 00:45:26,766
What if we tie her wings together?

589
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,352
There's no stopping us.

590
00:45:29,353 --> 00:45:32,605
We'll plunder every port
in all the seven seas.

591
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:38,236
Prepare to get under way,
you scurvy scallywags.

592
00:45:38,237 --> 00:45:40,321
We've got a ship to fly.

593
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:48,764
Ha. And as for you, you'll
make a fine little nightlight.

594
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:08,951
Swoggle me eyes.

595
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:12,287
Now, there's a sight.

596
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:16,482
Oh, don't feel foolish.

597
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:18,961
I was just too clever for you.
That's all.

598
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:25,700
Ah! Yes.

599
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:27,869
Now, you see, my little fairy,

600
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:30,764
navigating the Never
Seas is one thing.

601
00:46:30,998 --> 00:46:33,517
But to chart a course for the sky,

602
00:46:33,584 --> 00:46:36,728
not only do you need
longitude and latitude,

603
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:39,714
but you also need altitude.

604
00:46:41,717 --> 00:46:44,152
Now, let's not be a sore loser.

605
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:50,325
Once we're past the second star,
the world will be my oyster.

606
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:52,226
And I don't even like oysters.

607
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:57,273
We'll be in and out of every port so fast,
they won't even know what hit them.

608
00:46:58,442 --> 00:47:00,026
No, no, no.

609
00:47:00,027 --> 00:47:03,922
Nice try, but it's fairy-proof.
#Brilliant, right?

610
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:10,012
Oppenheimer!

611
00:47:10,746 --> 00:47:13,289
That ticking is driving me mad!

612
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:15,892
Right. It's just a clock, you know.

613
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:19,879
Well, not to worry.
#Pretty soon, we'll be flying so high

614
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,400
it'll make these high seas
look downright low!

615
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:27,428
Crazy. -Like we have a choice. #Come
on, guys, we're gonna get out of this.

616
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:29,013
Well, we wouldn't even be in it

617
00:47:29,014 --> 00:47:31,766
if our new Garden Fairy didn't
grow branches willy-nilly!

618
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:34,893
You're not saying this is my fault.
#Hmm. If the flower fits.

619
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:39,941
How can I cook with all that
infernal jingle-jangling?

620
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:42,109
There's only one thing to do.

621
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,883
Oh, much better.
Don't you think, Mum?

622
00:47:48,075 --> 00:47:50,785
None of it would've happened
if you would have come over to help me with the bee!

623
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:54,455
Are you saying this is my fault?
#Well, if the rose fits.

624
00:47:54,456 --> 00:47:57,083
Let's not point fingers.
It's Zarina's fault.

625
00:47:57,084 --> 00:48:00,670
Guys? Guys? -Right, what about
her? #Yeah, let's talk about that.

626
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:01,813
Guys, look!

627
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,734
Great. Just what I need.

628
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:11,448
Uh-uh-uh. Bad crocodile. Bad croc.

629
00:48:11,765 --> 00:48:13,766
I am not your mother!

630
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:17,746
Wait. Rosetta, he can get us
out of here. #You're right.

631
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:21,291
Good. Good crocodile. Come here.

632
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:24,586
<i>Come here, stocky.
Come to Mama.</i>

633
00:48:24,653 --> 00:48:26,546
Shh! Quiet.

634
00:48:27,197 --> 00:48:29,949
Okay. Now, pull us off the table.

635
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:32,577
Come here. Come to Mama.

636
00:48:32,578 --> 00:48:34,388
That's right, sugar.

637
00:48:35,956 --> 00:48:39,333
What is going on here?
#A stowaway, is it?

638
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:42,396
Oh, no!
#Oh, no, you don't.

639
00:48:42,462 --> 00:48:45,607
Hello.
#Hurry! Hurry!

640
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:49,361
Gotcha! -Rosetta! #A
little extra flavor.

641
00:48:55,309 --> 00:48:57,077
Good job, crocky.

642
00:48:57,144 --> 00:48:59,854
You are such a good little boy.
Yes, you are.

643
00:48:59,855 --> 00:49:02,356
What a good little widdle
snuggle wuggums. #That's his mama.

644
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:04,609
Okay, enough.
Let's get out of here.

645
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:08,255
Wait, Vidia. We can't just
race out there. #They'll see us.

646
00:49:12,868 --> 00:49:15,595
Make ready to sail!
#Aye aye, Captain!

647
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:18,039
I love the life of a pirate.

648
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:22,418
But I hate rats.
#Move it, Port.

649
00:49:22,419 --> 00:49:25,814
I'll move it in me own good time.
#Huh, see anything?

650
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:28,358
Nope. All clear up here.

651
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:32,011
Well, it's not clear down here.
It stinks!

652
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:35,991
I know, isn't it great?
#Smells just like skunk. -Huh.

653
00:49:36,058 --> 00:49:38,910
Spoken like a true Animal Fairy.
#I Wish.

654
00:49:38,977 --> 00:49:42,313
All right, you guys. Remember,
right arm, left foot. Got it?

655
00:49:42,314 --> 00:49:44,940
Aye aye.
#Sil, I'm right, you're left.

656
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:47,234
Right. -No, left.
#I mean, left. -What?

657
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:50,172
And you're right.
-Let's go. #AYE aye!

658
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:55,409
Big pole.
#Back, back, back.

659
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:59,306
Forward, forward, forward.
#Hey, you swabs, work faster!

660
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:03,435
Hey!
#Oppenheimer!

661
00:50:04,086 --> 00:50:06,021
Don't forget the kippers.

662
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:10,650
<i>And you, back to work.
#Ah, muy bien.</i>

663
00:50:10,926 --> 00:50:13,695
Ah, we're gonna fly, mate!
We're gonna fly!

664
00:50:13,762 --> 00:50:16,448
It's a do-si-do.
#I can't dance!

665
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,522
Look out!
#Fly!

666
00:50:24,523 --> 00:50:26,750
Would you watch where I'm going?
#Go, go!

667
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:29,795
Come on!

668
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:34,090
Hurry UP! -Okay. #We got it!

669
00:50:37,244 --> 00:50:39,137
Return that blue dust!

670
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:45,060
Or your friend is done for.

671
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:50,357
That's right.

672
00:50:50,382 --> 00:50:54,069
Captain Zarina
has been relieved of duty.

673
00:51:12,738 --> 00:51:16,132
You truly are a talented fairy.

674
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:43,684
Prepare to cast off!

675
00:51:43,685 --> 00:51:46,187
Weigh anchor and get ready to fly,
me hearties!

676
00:51:46,188 --> 00:51:47,789
Casting off!

677
00:51:51,234 --> 00:51:52,526
It's working!

678
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:55,839
I can't believe my eye!

679
00:51:57,157 --> 00:51:59,217
Weigh anchor!

680
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:04,747
We're flying!

681
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:06,516
We're flying!

682
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:10,770
It's perfect.
#We can fly!

683
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:13,189
Oh, my! Up, up and away!

684
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:18,361
Shiver me timbers, we're flying!

685
00:52:21,807 --> 00:52:24,951
Bon voyage, little captain.

686
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:29,039
No!

687
00:52:37,113 --> 00:52:40,842
Come on, hurry!
#Hurry!

688
00:52:44,496 --> 00:52:48,224
Help! Please!
#Help!

689
00:52:52,629 --> 00:52:54,421
Help me!

690
00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:02,322
Here, I'll dry you off.

691
00:53:06,226 --> 00:53:07,827
We're flying!

692
00:53:09,938 --> 00:53:11,706
Are you okay?

693
00:53:13,483 --> 00:53:16,878
You saved me.
#Why?

694
00:53:16,945 --> 00:53:20,548
Let's just say,
we're offering you quarter.

695
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:27,347
I'm so sorry.

696
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:31,768
They're headed for the second star.

697
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,438
If they make it past
we'll never find them.

698
00:53:36,006 --> 00:53:38,566
The blue dust will be gone forever.

699
00:53:40,176 --> 00:53:43,321
Then let's stop them
before they get there.

700
00:53:43,889 --> 00:53:45,407
Captain.

701
00:53:54,441 --> 00:53:57,484
Port, Starboard, get up the mizzen
and raise the royal.

702
00:53:57,485 --> 00:54:00,130
Aye aye, Captain!
Raising the royal!

703
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:05,593
More pixie dust!

704
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:11,349
Who's in the mood to plunder?

705
00:54:17,631 --> 00:54:19,232
You guys turn the ship around.

706
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:22,777
I'm getting back that blue dust.
-Right.

707
00:54:26,306 --> 00:54:29,743
Look alive, men!
The second star, dead ahead.

708
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,956
Nothing but smooth sailing.

709
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,376
Yeah!

710
00:54:39,903 --> 00:54:43,381
Fairies! Fairies!
#It's the fairies!

711
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:46,843
She's back?
Well, get them off my ship.

712
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,720
Gladly.

713
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:57,645
It's actually quite amusing.

714
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,274
Stand your ground, men!

715
00:55:09,057 --> 00:55:12,786
Yang, the helm!
#Ave ave, Captain!

716
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:15,646
Ladies, until we meet again.

717
00:55:17,065 --> 00:55:19,566
Great.
-Ha.

718
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:22,212
You dare to fight the
captain, do you?

719
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:24,130
Only until I get that dust.

720
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:27,342
Well, this should be fun.

721
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:32,013
Come here, you little cuties.

722
00:55:32,497 --> 00:55:34,849
Okay, this isn't working.

723
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,895
Fawn, the spyglass!
#Brilliant!

724
00:55:41,673 --> 00:55:43,024
You tiny thing.

725
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:48,446
No!

726
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:52,200
Man overboard!

727
00:55:52,434 --> 00:55:53,952
I did it!

728
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:57,497
Stop them, you imbeciles.
They're six-inch fairies!

729
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:01,709
Fawn, the wheel!

730
00:56:05,739 --> 00:56:07,549
Sil, whirlwind!

731
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:17,308
Take that! Whoa, whoa...

732
00:56:19,878 --> 00:56:23,756
Blast it. The second star!
#They turned the ship around!

733
00:56:23,757 --> 00:56:25,900
Yup, we sure did.

734
00:56:26,009 --> 00:56:28,111
Get this ship back on course!

735
00:56:28,178 --> 00:56:31,823
Aye aye, Captain!
#Now!

736
00:56:34,726 --> 00:56:37,120
Why you...
#Bull's-eye!

737
00:56:39,189 --> 00:56:41,166
No fair! Come back here!

738
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:45,128
Fairies, fairies,
nothing but fairies!

739
00:56:45,612 --> 00:56:48,256
Stop moving so fast.

740
00:56:48,323 --> 00:56:51,426
Ha-ha! Just one more, pirate.

741
00:56:51,534 --> 00:56:53,511
Jingle-jingle. Ha!

742
00:57:00,543 --> 00:57:03,771
Nice work.
-Just thinking like a Tinker.

743
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:05,940
No, no, no!
Take that, you little...

744
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:11,154
Avast, crocky! Charge!

745
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:15,057
No!
#Get it away, get it away, get it away, get it away!

746
00:57:15,058 --> 00:57:19,037
Yeah, that's it.
#Don't make me use my teaspoon.

747
00:57:19,104 --> 00:57:20,805
Oh, no. Oh, no,
you don't, you little...

748
00:57:21,981 --> 00:57:25,400
Oh! You ate my mummy's clock?

749
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:28,004
What was wrong with the spatula?

750
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:31,758
Sic him!

751
00:57:37,622 --> 00:57:39,933
Oh!
That's my crocky.

752
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,419
There's nothing I
revel quite as much

753
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,439
as a worthy opponent.

754
00:57:49,217 --> 00:57:51,486
You're stronger than you look.

755
00:57:53,138 --> 00:57:55,073
Hey, need some help?

756
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:59,786
Anchor's away!
#Grow some seaweed, sunflower.

757
00:58:14,701 --> 00:58:17,762
Now, that's some seaweed!

758
00:58:18,997 --> 00:58:21,432
I've had just about
enough of this.

759
00:58:31,676 --> 00:58:33,719
You, too!

760
00:58:37,265 --> 00:58:39,033
You're not going anywhere.

761
00:58:41,394 --> 00:58:44,205
These ought to fetch
a hefty price, eh?

762
00:58:49,736 --> 00:58:51,004
Back on course.

763
00:59:15,053 --> 00:59:17,530
Give me that dust!
#No!

764
00:59:36,908 --> 00:59:38,760
The dust! Not my dust!

765
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,388
No!

766
00:59:55,176 --> 00:59:57,844
I got the dust.
#Oh, you're okay.

767
00:59:57,845 --> 00:59:59,447
Oh, thank goodness.

768
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:03,493
Let's get you out of there.

769
01:00:05,645 --> 01:00:09,231
Lean right,
fly right.

770
01:00:09,232 --> 01:00:11,542
I'll take that!

771
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:13,961
Now, where was I?

772
01:00:14,028 --> 01:00:17,322
Ah, yes. The second star.

773
01:00:20,702 --> 01:00:23,012
You simply don't give up.

774
01:00:31,045 --> 01:00:33,564
Well, I guess I'm
stronger than I look.

775
01:00:36,884 --> 01:00:37,985
The second star.

776
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:47,578
Zarina!

777
01:00:49,731 --> 01:00:51,916
You fought well, little fairy.

778
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:55,545
But it's over.
#The dust is mine.

779
01:00:56,029 --> 01:00:58,005
The ship is mine.

780
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:02,802
Your adventure has come to an end.

781
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:07,640
Oh, go ahead, take it.

782
01:01:07,707 --> 01:01:10,309
What's one speck between friends?

783
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,859
No, really, I think you
should have it all!

784
01:01:19,469 --> 01:01:21,529
From a trickle to a roar.

785
01:01:32,815 --> 01:01:33,940
We're free!

786
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:38,296
Look at him go!
#He's very fast.

787
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:40,214
Yeah, you think?

788
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:46,554
Is it time to get that
blue dust back? #Watch this.

789
01:01:56,297 --> 01:01:59,650
Can't fly without dust.
#Blast!

790
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:06,866
Goodbye, James.

791
01:02:07,767 --> 01:02:11,746
Curse you, fairies!
#Curse you!

792
01:02:11,813 --> 01:02:14,874
Tiny she-devils they are, really.

793
01:02:20,863 --> 01:02:23,323
Oh, no, no, no!

794
01:02:23,324 --> 01:02:25,635
I am not a codfish!

795
01:02:26,536 --> 01:02:28,554
I'm a pirate!

796
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:32,225
All right.

797
01:02:33,251 --> 01:02:37,188
You got the dust!
#We did it!

798
01:02:38,089 --> 01:02:39,941
We can go home!

799
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:43,444
Oh, I'm gonna soak in a nice,
hot milkweed bath.

800
01:02:43,845 --> 01:02:47,514
Get the smell of pirates off me.
#That was what I was thinking.

801
01:02:47,515 --> 01:02:49,283
You said it, Ro.

802
01:02:51,561 --> 01:02:55,623
Here, please,
take this back to Pixie Hollow.

803
01:03:07,326 --> 01:03:08,803
Uh, Zarina,

804
01:03:09,412 --> 01:03:12,306
we didn't just come for the dust.

805
01:03:27,096 --> 01:03:30,432
Um, Ro? There's something
you should know.

806
01:03:30,433 --> 01:03:32,368
It's about your hair.

807
01:03:34,103 --> 01:03:37,063
First, I lose my talent,
then I become a mother.

808
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:40,358
I do-si-doed in a stinky shoe,
and now, my hair?

809
01:03:41,903 --> 01:03:45,238
<i>Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah</i>

810
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:47,908
<i>Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah</i>

811
01:03:47,909 --> 01:03:50,052
<i>Well, you don't know who you are</i>

812
01:03:50,077 --> 01:03:54,015
<i>Sky is the limit
And I just wanna flow</i>

813
01:03:54,123 --> 01:03:57,542
<i>Free as a spirit on
a journey of hope</i>

814
01:03:57,543 --> 01:03:59,395
Hang on, guys!

815
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:02,356
<i>Cut the strings and let me go</i>

816
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:07,278
<i>I'm weightless, I'm weightless</i>

817
01:04:07,303 --> 01:04:10,555
<i>Millions of balloons
tethered to the ground</i>

818
01:04:10,556 --> 01:04:14,160
Hey! There it is.
#Home.

819
01:04:28,741 --> 01:04:30,885
And... now!

820
01:04:58,854 --> 01:04:59,980
Bobble!

821
01:05:01,607 --> 01:05:02,917
You're awake!

822
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:22,478
This is the best show yet!

823
01:05:32,388 --> 01:05:33,722
Uh, girls?

824
01:05:33,723 --> 01:05:36,784
Queen Clarion,
we got the blue dust back.

825
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:40,663
Which I didn't know was missing.

826
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,582
We also got Zarina.

827
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:45,658
Zarina!

828
01:05:49,572 --> 01:05:51,424
Oh, you're home!

829
01:05:52,074 --> 01:05:54,534
Yeah. And from now on, I promise...

830
01:05:54,535 --> 01:05:58,288
You know, Zarina's pretty much
mastered that pixie dust thing of hers.

831
01:05:58,289 --> 01:06:00,957
Yeah, she even grew
a pixie dust tree.

832
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:03,185
Now, we've got an extra.

833
01:06:04,587 --> 01:06:07,148
Does this talent of
yours have a name?

834
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:10,925
"Alchemy."
Pixie dust alchemy.

835
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:12,927
You should really
see her in action.

836
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:15,823
Oh, you definitely should.
-Very impressive.

837
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:22,997
Well, we do have an audience.

838
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:45,478
Thanks.

839
01:06:57,723 --> 01:07:01,494
Well, how's my hair?
#L'Â£'S good!

840
01:07:59,368 --> 01:08:00,845
All right!

841
01:08:14,258 --> 01:08:15,943
Gorgeous.

842
01:08:19,889 --> 01:08:23,641
<i>If I could reach the
top of the world</i>

843
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:27,288
<i>Be all I am
It'd be so beautiful</i>

844
01:08:28,189 --> 01:08:33,693
<i>If only I could be brave
and I could be strong</i>

845
01:08:33,694 --> 01:08:36,529
<i>I would know where I belong</i>

846
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,092
<i>If only</i>

847
01:08:40,993 --> 01:08:43,620
<i>I wanna feel free to be who I am</i>

848
01:08:43,621 --> 01:08:46,915
<i>What I'm about is
more than I've been</i>

849
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:50,251
<i>Ready to show the world who I am</i>

850
01:08:50,252 --> 01:08:53,713
<i>Started it out, but I'm holding in</i>

851
01:08:53,714 --> 01:08:56,925
<i>And find my own place to stay</i>

852
01:08:56,926 --> 01:09:00,303
<i>I can be who I am</i>

853
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:09,079
<i>I'm closer to what I'm meant to be</i>

854
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:12,458
<i>If I try I know that
I can get there</i>

855
01:09:12,608 --> 01:09:15,502
<i>I'm not gonna stop 'cause I believe</i>

856
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:19,965
<i>That there's so much more to me</i>

857
01:09:23,202 --> 01:09:26,138
Man in the water!
#Oh, dear.

858
01:09:26,455 --> 01:09:27,806
<i>Oh, my.</i>

859
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:31,435
That's a very nice hook.

860
01:09:33,379 --> 01:09:35,689
Just give me a hand.

861
01:09:35,756 --> 01:09:38,692
<i>I wanna feel free to be who I am</i>

862
01:09:38,717 --> 01:09:42,095
<i>What I am about is
more than I've been</i>

863
01:09:42,096 --> 01:09:45,390
<i>Ready to show the world who I am</i>

864
01:09:45,391 --> 01:09:48,726
<i>Started it out, but I am holding in</i>

865
01:09:48,727 --> 01:09:52,021
<i>Find my own place to stay</i>

866
01:09:52,022 --> 01:09:55,084
<i>So I can be who I am</i>

867
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:03,342
<i>I can be who I am</i>

868
01:10:03,701 --> 01:10:06,637
<i>I can be who I am</i>

869
01:12:10,828 --> 01:12:12,870
<i>First the Tower of London, arr!</i>

870
01:12:12,871 --> 01:12:14,914
<i>The guards won't know what hit it</i>

871
01:12:14,915 --> 01:12:17,083
<i>We'll swoop right down
and take the crown</i>

872
01:12:17,084 --> 01:12:20,753
<i>And the Crown Jewels with it
And when we fly to Paris</i>

873
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:23,089
<i>Oh, the treasures I'll be grabbin'</i>

874
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:25,299
<i>The Mona Lisa will look lovely</i>

875
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:28,428
<i>Hanging in me cabin
Hey-ho</i>

876
01:12:28,429 --> 01:12:30,346
<i>Imagine the places that we'll go</i>

877
01:12:30,347 --> 01:12:32,432
<i>No one can stop us
When we're so</i>

878
01:12:32,433 --> 01:12:35,601
<i>High in the stratosphere!</i>

879
01:12:35,602 --> 01:12:38,396
<i>Hey-ho
We'll be the freighter that plunders</i>

880
01:12:38,397 --> 01:12:41,774
<i>Every one of the world's seven
wonders When we're up in the skies</i>

881
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:43,776
<i>For who can fight a
frigate that flies?</i>

882
01:12:43,777 --> 01:12:47,655
<i>No one can fight a
frigate that flies</i>

883
01:12:47,656 --> 01:12:49,782
<i>Next we'll roam to Rome, me lads</i>

884
01:12:49,783 --> 01:12:53,578
<i>And here's what I'll be stealin'
I'll rob the Sistine Chapel</i>

885
01:12:53,579 --> 01:12:55,830
<i>Of the Sistine Chapel's cieilin'</i>

886
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:57,874
<i>And for all the folks in Egypt</i>

887
01:12:57,875 --> 01:12:59,917
<i>It will be a dismal day</i>

888
01:12:59,918 --> 01:13:01,961
<i>They'll be crying for their mummies</i>

889
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:05,590
<i>When we take their mummies away!
Hey-ho</i>

890
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:07,425
<i>Imagine the places that we'll go</i>

891
01:13:07,426 --> 01:13:09,969
<i>No can stop us when we're so high!</i>

892
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:12,513
<i>They will all cower in fear</i>

893
01:13:12,514 --> 01:13:15,183
<i>Hey-ho, from Delhi to Rio to Venice</i>

894
01:13:15,184 --> 01:13:18,686
<i>There's no city that we will not
menace When we're up in the skies</i>

895
01:13:18,687 --> 01:13:20,730
<i>For who can fight a
frigate that flies?</i>

896
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:24,692
<i>No one can fight a
frigate that flies</i>

897
01:13:24,693 --> 01:13:28,446
<i>Oh, how high we will be!
-We will be</i>

898
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:32,366
<i>'Cause the blue fairy dust
Surely packs a mighty wallop</i>

899
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:33,576
<i>Only takes a dollop</i>

900
01:13:33,577 --> 01:13:36,662
<i>Soon it will set us free
-We'll be free</i>

901
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:38,873
<i>From the chains of gravity</i>

902
01:13:38,874 --> 01:13:40,958
<i>Then we'll hoist up the sail</i>

903
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:44,921
<i>And we'll set course for the sun
'Cause when you've got wings</i>

904
01:13:44,922 --> 01:13:47,006
<i>No wicked deed cannot be done</i>

905
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:49,008
<i>And we owe it all</i>

906
01:13:49,009 --> 01:13:53,280
<i>To our great and glorious captain</i>

907
01:13:53,931 --> 01:13:55,640
<i>Two, three, four!</i>

908
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:58,601
<i>Hey-ho, imagine the
places that we'll go</i>

909
01:13:58,602 --> 01:14:01,229
<i>No one can stop us
when we're so high</i>

910
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:03,815
<i>Givin' a pirate cheer
-Arr!</i>

911
01:14:03,816 --> 01:14:06,567
<i>Hey-ho, we'll be the
freighter that plunders</i>

912
01:14:06,568 --> 01:14:09,862
<i>Every one of the world's seven
wonders When we're up in the skies</i>

913
01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:11,989
<i>For who can fight a
frigate that flies?</i>

914
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:14,951
<i>Hey-ho, there's not
a town or a county</i>

915
01:14:14,952 --> 01:14:17,620
<i>That will not yield its bounty up</i>

916
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:20,164
<i>When our ship draws near</i>

917
01:14:20,165 --> 01:14:23,126
<i>Hey-ho, there's not
a city or village</i>

918
01:14:23,127 --> 01:14:26,420
<i>That we will not plunder or pillage
When we're up in the skies</i>

919
01:14:26,421 --> 01:14:28,422
<i>For who can fight a
frigate that flies?</i>

920
01:14:28,423 --> 01:14:32,552
<i>And every nation
will give a donation</i>

921
01:14:32,553 --> 01:14:35,805
<i>When they see us sail the skies</i>

922
01:14:35,806 --> 01:14:39,409
<i>In a frigate that flies!
Hey!</i>

923
01:14:40,305 --> 01:15:40,436
