Jednom davno u dalekoj, 
dalekoj galaksiji...

00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:35,625
ZVJEZDANI RATOVI

00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,875
Epizoda V

6
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:46,666
IMPERIJ UZVRAÆA UDARAC

7
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:52,608
Mraèna su vremena došla za pobunu.

8
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:56,130
Iako je Zvjezda Smrti uništena, 
imperijalne trupe su istjerale

9
00:00:56,132 --> 00:00:59,956
pobunjenièke snage iz njihove 
tajne baze i stale da ih

10
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:03,652
progone po èitavoj galaksiji.

11
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:10,217
Izbjegavajuæi strašnu imperijalnu flotu, 
grupa boraca za slobodu

12
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:13,312
pod vodstvom Luka Skywalkera, 
zasnovala je novu tajnu bazu

13
00:01:13,314 --> 00:01:16,425
na zabaèenoj, ledenoj planeti Hoth.

14
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:22,043
Zli lord Darth Vader, opsjednut željom 
da pronaðe mladog Skywalkera

15
00:01:22,045 --> 00:01:25,957
razaslao je tisuæe špijunskih sondi

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,191
ka udaljenim krajevima svemira...

17
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:36,312
Echo 3 zove Echo 7.

18
00:03:36,414 --> 00:03:38,314
Han, prijatelju, èuješ li me?

19
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,316
<i>Loud and clear, kid.
What's up?</i>

20
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:41,385
I finished
my circle.

21
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:43,147
I don't pick up
any life readings.

22
00:03:43,254 --> 00:03:45,085
<i>There isn't enough life
on this ice cube...</i>

23
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:46,588
<i>to fill a space cruiser.</i>

24
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:48,488
<i>Sensors are placed.
I'm going back.</i>

25
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:50,322
Right.
I'll see you shortly.

26
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:52,293
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

27
00:03:52,397 --> 00:03:54,797
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.

28
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:58,802
Steady, girl.
What's the matter?

29
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:00,894
You smell something?

30
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:02,267
Rrraaah!

31
00:04:41,412 --> 00:04:42,845
Chewie!

32
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:45,313
Chewie?

33
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,678
Chewie!

34
00:04:49,787 --> 00:04:51,345
All right!
Don't lose your temper.

35
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:53,617
I'll come right back
and give you a hand.

36
00:05:14,312 --> 00:05:15,404
Solo?

37
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:17,777
No sign of life
out there, General.

38
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:19,179
The sensors are in place.

39
00:05:19,283 --> 00:05:20,409
You'll know if anything
comes around.

40
00:05:20,518 --> 00:05:22,076
Commander Skywalker
reported in yet?

41
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:24,381
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

42
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:26,548
With all the meteor activity
in this system...

43
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:28,353
it's going to be difficult
to spot approaching ships.

44
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:30,689
General, I got to leave.
I can't stay anymore.

45
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:31,784
I'm sorry to hear that.

46
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,022
Well, there's
a price on my head.

47
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:34,530
If I don't pay off
Jabba the Hutt...

48
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:35,860
I'm a dead man.

49
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:38,060
A death mark's
not an easy thing to live with.

50
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,568
You're a good fighter, Solo.

51
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:41,662
I hate to lose you.

52
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:43,638
Thank you, General.

53
00:05:50,548 --> 00:05:53,779
Well, Your Highness,
guess this is it.

54
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:55,785
That's right.

55
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:59,323
Well, don't get
all mushy on me.

56
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:01,051
So long, Princess.

57
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:05,891
Han!

58
00:06:05,997 --> 00:06:07,897
Yes, Your Highnessness?

59
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:10,024
I thought you had
decided to stay.

60
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:12,102
Well, the bounty hunter
we ran into in Ord Mantell...

61
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:13,101
changed my mind.

62
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:15,229
Han, we need you!

63
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:16,237
<i>We need?</i>

64
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,398
Yes.

65
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:18,406
<i>Well, what about
you need?</i>

66
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:19,567
<i>I need?</i>

67
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:21,907
I don't know what
you're talking about.

68
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:23,776
You probably don't.

69
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:25,644
And what precisely
am I supposed to know?

70
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,547
Come on!

71
00:06:27,652 --> 00:06:29,916
You want me to stay
because of the way you feel about me.

72
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:31,682
Yes! You're
a great help to us.

73
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:32,687
You're a natural leader.

74
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,384
No! That's not it.

75
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:36,892
Come on.

76
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:38,325
A-ha!

77
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:39,919
You're imagining things.

78
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:41,794
Am I? Then why are
you following me?

79
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:44,800
Afraid I was gonna leave
without giving you a good-bye kiss?

80
00:06:44,902 --> 00:06:46,301
I'd just as soon
kiss a Wookiee!

81
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:47,803
I can arrange that.

82
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:49,873
You could use
a good kiss!

83
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:54,305
I didn't ask you to turn on
the thermal heater.

84
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:57,813
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.

85
00:06:57,915 --> 00:07:00,315
How will we
dry out her clothes?

86
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:02,977
Oh, switch off!

87
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:04,418
Why did you
take this apart now?

88
00:07:04,522 --> 00:07:06,251
I'm trying to get us out of here,
and you pull both...

89
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:07,722
Excuse me, sir.

90
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:08,849
Put them
back together now!

91
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,790
Might I have a word
with you, please?

92
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:10,792
What do you want?

93
00:07:10,895 --> 00:07:11,953
Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.

94
00:07:12,063 --> 00:07:12,961
She's been trying to get you
on the communicator.

95
00:07:13,064 --> 00:07:13,962
I turned it off.

96
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:15,794
I don't want
to talk to her.

97
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,834
Well, Princess Leia is wondering
about Master Luke.

98
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:18,833
He hasn't
come back yet.

99
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:19,834
She doesn't know
where he is.

100
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:20,835
I don't know
where he is.

101
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:21,870
Nobody knows
where he is.

102
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:23,304
What do you mean,
nobody knows?

103
00:07:23,407 --> 00:07:25,307
- Well, uh, you see...
- Deck Officer!

104
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:26,808
- Deck Officer!
- Excuse me, sir, might I...

105
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:27,878
Yes, sir?

106
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:29,310
Do you know where
Commander Skywalker is?

107
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:30,812
I haven't seen him.

108
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:32,348
It's possible he came through
the south entrance.

109
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,348
<i>It's possible?</i>

110
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:35,078
Why don't you
go find out?

111
00:07:35,186 --> 00:07:36,210
It's getting
dark out there.

112
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,582
Yes, sir.

113
00:07:37,688 --> 00:07:39,815
Excuse me, sir.
Might I inquire what's going on?

114
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:41,118
Why not?

115
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:42,317
Impossible man.

116
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:43,825
Come along, R2,
let's find Princess Leia.

117
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:45,088
Between ourselves...

118
00:07:45,196 --> 00:07:47,790
I think Master Luke is
in considerable danger.

119
00:07:57,408 --> 00:07:59,569
Sir, Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

120
00:07:59,677 --> 00:08:00,769
He might have
forgotten to check in.

121
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:02,209
Not likely.
Are the speeders ready?

122
00:08:02,313 --> 00:08:04,406
Uh, not yet. We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

123
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:05,641
We'll have to go out
on tauntauns.

124
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,479
Sir, the temperature's
dropping too rapidly.

125
00:08:07,585 --> 00:08:09,849
That's right,
and my friend's out in it.

126
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:16,719
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

127
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:19,353
Then I'll see you
in hell. Hyah!

128
00:08:42,386 --> 00:08:44,877
Rrraaah!

129
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,740
Grrrr!

130
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:55,422
Graaah!

131
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:38,630
You must
come along now, R2.

132
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:40,727
There's really
nothing more we can do.

133
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:43,170
And my joints
are freezing up.

134
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:45,572
Don't say things
like that!

135
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:47,166
Of course we'll see
Master Luke again.

136
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,678
And he'll be quite
all right.

137
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,678
You'll see.

138
00:10:50,781 --> 00:10:52,646
Stupid little short circuit.

139
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,809
He'll be quite all right.

140
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:54,271
Sir, all the patrols
are in.

141
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:55,345
Still no...

142
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,313
Still no contact
from Skywalker or Solo.

143
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:03,080
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals...

144
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:05,985
although he does admit
that his own range is far too weak...

145
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,421
to abandon all hope.

146
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:09,288
Your Highness, there's nothing more
we can do tonight.

147
00:12:09,393 --> 00:12:11,657
The shield doors
must be closed.

148
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:13,962
Close the doors.

149
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:14,963
Yes, sir.

150
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:21,995
R2 says the chances
of survival are 725 to 1.

151
00:12:30,714 --> 00:12:31,976
Gahhh!

152
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:36,747
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes...

153
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,690
from time to time.

154
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:43,259
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

155
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:48,197
Don't worry
about Master Luke.

156
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:49,698
I'm sure
he'll be all right.

157
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,268
He's quite clever, you know,
for a human being.

158
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:09,283
<i>Luke.</i>

159
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:13,219
<i>Luke.</i>

160
00:13:20,764 --> 00:13:22,288
Ben?

161
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,027
<i>You will go to
the Dagobah system.</i>

162
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:26,899
Dagobah system?

163
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:29,802
<i>There you will
learn from Yoda...</i>

164
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:34,367
<i>the Jedi master
who instructed me.</i>

165
00:13:34,478 --> 00:13:36,343
Ben!

166
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:37,675
Ben!

167
00:13:41,952 --> 00:13:43,351
Luke!

168
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:45,820
Luke!

169
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:54,329
Don't do this, Luke.

170
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:57,832
Come on,
give me a sign here.

171
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,919
Not much time.

172
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:22,253
Ben.

173
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:24,589
Ben.

174
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:29,924
Hang on, kid.

175
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:33,194
Dagobah system.

176
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:34,271
Whew!

177
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:37,306
This may smell bad, kid...

178
00:14:37,408 --> 00:14:39,376
Yoda.

179
00:14:39,476 --> 00:14:41,137
But it'll keep you warm...

180
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:43,509
till I get the shelter up.

181
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:46,105
Ben... Dagobah...

182
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:47,878
Ahhh!

183
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:53,287
Ah! I thought they
smelled bad on the outside!

184
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:38,624
Echo Base, I've got something.

185
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:41,796
Not much, but it could be a life-form.

186
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:48,176
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

187
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,179
This is Rogue Two.

188
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:52,715
This is Rogue Two.

189
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:56,445
Captain Solo,
do you copy?

190
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:05,126
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

191
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:07,663
This is Rogue Two.

192
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:09,164
<i>Good morning.</i>

193
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:11,632
<i>Nice of you guys
to drop by.</i>

194
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:14,101
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

195
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:15,603
I've found them.

196
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:17,503
Repeat, I've found them.

197
00:16:47,771 --> 00:16:49,102
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

198
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:50,434
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

199
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,439
Thanks, 3PO.

200
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:54,272
R2 expresses
his relief also.

201
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:57,142
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

202
00:16:57,247 --> 00:16:58,646
You look strong enough...

203
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:00,649
to pull the ears
off a gundark.

204
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:02,150
Thanks to you.

205
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:04,846
That's two
you owe me, junior.

206
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:06,513
Well, Your Worship...

207
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:09,456
looks like you managed to keep me
around for a little while longer.

208
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,118
I had nothing
to do with it.

209
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:12,991
General Rieekan
thinks it's dangerous...

210
00:17:13,097 --> 00:17:14,257
for any ships
to leave the system...

211
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:15,696
until we've activated
the energy field.

212
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,699
That's a good story.

213
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:18,995
<i>I think you just can't bear...</i>

214
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,731
to let a gorgeous guy like me
out of your sight.

215
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,138
I don't know where you get
your delusions, laser brain.

216
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:26,903
Hah hah hah!

217
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:30,145
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

218
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:33,648
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

219
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:36,219
She expressed her
true feelings for me.

220
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,651
My...

221
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:40,724
Why, you stuck-up,
half-witted...

222
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:43,384
scruffy-looking
nerf herder!

223
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:46,554
Who's scruffy-looking?

224
00:17:49,032 --> 00:17:50,099
I must have hit
pretty close to the mark...

225
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:51,166
I must have hit
pretty close to the mark...

226
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:53,293
to get her all riled up
like that, huh, kid?

227
00:17:56,774 --> 00:18:00,232
Well, I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

228
00:18:05,282 --> 00:18:08,649
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command center.</i>

229
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:14,685
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command center.</i>

230
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:15,781
Take it easy.

231
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:18,259
Excuse us,
please.

232
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:23,292
Princess,
we have a visitor.

233
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,063
Picked up something outside
the base's Zone 12 moving east.

234
00:18:27,171 --> 00:18:28,297
It's metal.

235
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:29,372
Then it couldn't be
one of those creatures.

236
00:18:29,473 --> 00:18:31,134
Could be a speeder,
one of ours.

237
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:32,469
No.

238
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:33,634
Wait.

239
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:36,372
There's something
very weak coming through.

240
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:42,810
Sir, I'm fluent in six million
forms of communication.

241
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,650
This signal is not used
by the Alliance.

242
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:47,815
It could be
an imperial code.

243
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:53,058
It isn't friendly,
whatever it is.

244
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:55,063
Come on, Chewie,
let's check it out.

245
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:58,396
Send Rogues 10 and 11
to Station 38.

246
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:15,879
Grrr!

247
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:31,496
Gahhh!

248
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,598
<i>I'm afraid
there's not much left.</i>

249
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:35,603
What was it?

250
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:37,139
<i>Droid of some kind.</i>

251
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:39,141
<i>I didn't hit it that hard.
Must've had a self-destruct.</i>

252
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:41,006
An imperial probe droid.

253
00:19:41,111 --> 00:19:44,103
<i>It's a good bet the Empire
knows we're here.</i>

254
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:46,182
We'd better start
the evacuation.

255
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:32,357
Admiral.

256
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:33,861
Yes, Captain?

257
00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:36,159
I think we've got
something, sir.

258
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:38,325
The report
is only a fragment...

259
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:39,993
from a probe droid
in the Hoth system...

260
00:20:40,103 --> 00:20:41,536
but it's the best lead we've had.

261
00:20:41,638 --> 00:20:44,471
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

262
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:45,667
I want proof,
not leads.

263
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:47,676
The visuals indicate
life readings.

264
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:48,676
It could mean anything.

265
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:50,076
If we followed up
every lead...

266
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,511
But, sir...

267
00:20:51,615 --> 00:20:53,173
the Hoth system is supposed to be
devoid of humans.

268
00:20:53,283 --> 00:20:54,477
You've found something?

269
00:20:54,585 --> 00:20:55,677
Yes, my lord.

270
00:20:58,121 --> 00:21:00,453
That's it.
The rebels are there.

271
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:05,017
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

272
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:06,026
It could be smugglers...

273
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:07,926
That is the system.

274
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:10,431
And I'm sure Skywalker
is with them.

275
00:21:10,534 --> 00:21:13,526
Set your course
for the Hoth system.

276
00:21:13,637 --> 00:21:15,832
General Veers,
prepare your men.

277
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:17,338
Admiral.

278
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:26,374
Groups 7 and 10 will stay behind
to fly the speeders.

279
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:28,041
As soon as each transport is loaded...

280
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:30,278
evacuation control will give clearance
for immediate launch.

281
00:21:30,387 --> 00:21:31,354
Right, sir.

282
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,551
All right!
That's it.

283
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,684
Try it.

284
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:42,623
Oh! Turn it off!
Turn it off!

285
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,894
Turn it off!

286
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:48,665
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47 s.

287
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:49,670
Forget
the heavy equipment.

288
00:21:49,773 --> 00:21:50,967
There's plenty of time...

289
00:21:51,074 --> 00:21:52,666
to get the smaller modules
on the transports.

290
00:21:52,776 --> 00:21:53,674
Take care, sir.

291
00:21:53,777 --> 00:21:54,744
Thanks.

292
00:21:57,781 --> 00:22:00,909
Chewie, take care
of yourself, O. K?

293
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:06,353
O.K., O. K!

294
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,391
Hi, kid.

295
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:10,551
There's got to be
a reason for it.

296
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:12,026
Check it
at the other end.

297
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:13,289
Wait a second.

298
00:22:14,464 --> 00:22:15,829
You all right?

299
00:22:15,932 --> 00:22:17,229
Yeah.

300
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,938
Be careful.

301
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:27,772
You, too.

302
00:22:32,816 --> 00:22:35,683
General, there's a fleet
of Stardestroyers...

303
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:38,687
coming out of hyperspace
in Sector Four.

304
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:41,690
Reroute all power
to the energy shield.

305
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:44,693
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.

306
00:22:44,795 --> 00:22:46,262
Prepare for ground assault.

307
00:23:00,277 --> 00:23:02,177
What is it, General?

308
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,871
My lord, the fleet has moved out
of light speed.

309
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,141
ComScan has detected
an energy field...

310
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:08,649
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

311
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:11,380
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

312
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:14,150
The rebels are alerted
to our presence.

313
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:17,158
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

314
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,160
He... He felt surprise
was wiser.

315
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:21,753
He is as clumsy
as he is stupid.

316
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:25,164
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

317
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:26,735
Yes, my lord.

318
00:23:33,777 --> 00:23:35,335
Lord Vader.

319
00:23:35,445 --> 00:23:37,675
The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to...

320
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:39,408
Aaugh!

321
00:23:39,516 --> 00:23:43,179
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

322
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:44,480
Captain Piett.

323
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:46,180
Yes, my lord?

324
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:49,281
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

325
00:23:49,392 --> 00:23:52,361
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

326
00:23:52,462 --> 00:23:55,693
You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

327
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,198
Thank you,
Lord Vader.

328
00:23:59,202 --> 00:24:02,137
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

329
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:05,003
The heavy transport ships will leave
as soon as they're loaded.

330
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:07,269
Only two fighter escorts
per ship.

331
00:24:07,377 --> 00:24:10,107
The energy shield can only be opened
for a short time...

332
00:24:10,213 --> 00:24:12,647
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

333
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:15,149
Two fighters against
a Stardestroyer?

334
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:17,652
The ion cannon
will fire several shots...

335
00:24:17,754 --> 00:24:19,255
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

336
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,756
To make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

337
00:24:20,857 --> 00:24:22,950
When you've gotten past
the energy shield...

338
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:25,152
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.

339
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:26,661
Understood?

340
00:24:26,763 --> 00:24:28,162
Good luck.

341
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:30,165
O.K. Everybody
to your stations.

342
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:31,461
Let's go.

343
00:24:48,585 --> 00:24:51,952
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

344
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:53,647
Prepare to open shield.

345
00:24:59,462 --> 00:25:01,692
Sir, rebel ships are
coming into our sector.

346
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:03,857
Good. Our first catch
of the day.

347
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:07,502
Stand by, ion control.

348
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,028
Fire.

349
00:25:24,054 --> 00:25:28,354
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

350
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:31,859
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

351
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:39,566
Feeling all right, sir?

352
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:41,398
Just like new, Dak.
How about you?

353
00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:44,564
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

354
00:25:44,674 --> 00:25:46,801
I know what you mean.

355
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:06,287
Echo Station
Three-T-Eight.

356
00:26:06,396 --> 00:26:08,125
We've spotted
imperial walkers.

357
00:26:08,231 --> 00:26:10,495
<i>Imperial walkers
on the north ridge.</i>

358
00:26:33,123 --> 00:26:35,455
Echo Station Five-Seven.
We're on our way.

359
00:26:40,864 --> 00:26:42,855
All right, boys,
keep tight now.

360
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:45,127
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

361
00:26:45,235 --> 00:26:46,702
Steady, Dak.

362
00:26:46,803 --> 00:26:48,668
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.

363
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:54,103
All right.
I'm coming in.

364
00:26:58,615 --> 00:27:00,742
Hobbie,
you still with me?

365
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:24,532
That armor's too strong
for blasters.

366
00:27:26,977 --> 00:27:29,172
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.

367
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,045
Go for the legs. It might be
our only chance of stopping them.

368
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:35,083
All right.
Stand by, Dak.

369
00:27:35,185 --> 00:27:38,018
Oh, Luke, we've got a malfunction
in fire control.

370
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:40,112
I'll have to cut in
the auxiliary.

371
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:42,817
Just hang on.
Hang on, Dak.

372
00:27:42,926 --> 00:27:45,053
Get ready to fire
that tow cable.

373
00:27:47,263 --> 00:27:48,230
Ah!

374
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:51,434
Dak?

375
00:27:51,534 --> 00:27:52,558
Dak!

376
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:18,527
Yes, Lord Vader, I've reached
the main power generators.

377
00:28:18,628 --> 00:28:20,095
The shield will be down
in moments.

378
00:28:20,196 --> 00:28:22,892
You may start your landing.

379
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:27,900
Rogue Three.

380
00:28:28,004 --> 00:28:29,164
Copy, Rogue Leader.

381
00:28:29,272 --> 00:28:31,137
Wedge, I've lost my gunner.

382
00:28:31,241 --> 00:28:32,538
You'll have to
make this shot.

383
00:28:32,642 --> 00:28:34,371
I'll cover for you.

384
00:28:34,477 --> 00:28:37,935
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

385
00:28:38,048 --> 00:28:39,982
Coming around,
Rogue Leader.

386
00:28:42,852 --> 00:28:45,218
Steady, Rogue Two.

387
00:28:45,321 --> 00:28:46,379
Activate harpoon.

388
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,883
Good shot, Janson.

389
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,232
- One more pass.
- Coming around, Wedge.

390
00:29:04,774 --> 00:29:07,072
Cable out.
Let her go!

391
00:29:07,177 --> 00:29:09,008
Detach cable.

392
00:29:09,112 --> 00:29:10,272
Cable detached.

393
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:19,782
Come on.

394
00:29:26,796 --> 00:29:28,286
Hah! That got him!

395
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:30,195
I see it, Wedge.
Good work.

396
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,598
I don't think...

397
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:32,963
we can protect
two transports at a time.

398
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:35,128
It's risky, but we can't
hold out much longer.

399
00:29:35,238 --> 00:29:37,638
We have no choice.

400
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,638
Launch patrol.

401
00:29:38,741 --> 00:29:40,606
Evacuate remaining ground staff.

402
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,200
Gahhh!

403
00:29:42,312 --> 00:29:44,746
No, no! No.

404
00:29:44,848 --> 00:29:46,748
This one goes there.

405
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,011
That one goes there, right?

406
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:53,021
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?

407
00:29:54,257 --> 00:29:56,555
And do take good care
of yourself.

408
00:30:00,263 --> 00:30:01,787
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

409
00:30:25,588 --> 00:30:27,749
All troops will debark
for ground assault.

410
00:30:27,857 --> 00:30:30,519
Prepare to target
the main generator.

411
00:30:34,164 --> 00:30:35,131
Rogue Two,
are you all right?

412
00:30:35,231 --> 00:30:37,665
Yeah. I'm with you,
Rogue Leader.

413
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:39,598
Well, set harpoon.
I'll cover for you.

414
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:42,536
Coming around.

415
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:45,437
Watch that cross fire, boys.

416
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:47,373
Set for
position three.

417
00:30:47,477 --> 00:30:48,774
Steady.

418
00:30:48,878 --> 00:30:50,175
Stay tight and low.

419
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,406
This is it!

420
00:30:51,514 --> 00:30:52,776
Aah!

421
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,547
Hobbie!

422
00:30:58,655 --> 00:31:00,122
I've been hit!

423
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:43,663
You all right?

424
00:31:43,766 --> 00:31:45,700
Why are you
still here?

425
00:31:45,802 --> 00:31:47,667
Heard the command center had been hit.

426
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:48,668
You've got
your clearance to leave.

427
00:31:48,771 --> 00:31:50,636
Don't worry. I'll leave.

428
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,435
First I'm gonna
get you to your ship.

429
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:54,169
Your Highness,
we must take this last transport.

430
00:31:54,277 --> 00:31:55,175
It's our only hope.

431
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:56,404
Send all troops
in Sector 12...

432
00:31:56,512 --> 00:31:58,639
to the south slope
to protect the fighters.

433
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:02,251
<i>Imperial troops
have entered the base.</i>

434
00:32:02,352 --> 00:32:03,717
<i>Imperial troops
have entered...</i>

435
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,344
Come on.
That's it.

436
00:32:05,455 --> 00:32:08,015
Give the evacuation
code signal.

437
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,791
And get to your transports!

438
00:32:11,894 --> 00:32:13,794
Oh! Wait for me!

439
00:32:13,896 --> 00:32:16,330
Begin retreat!

440
00:32:16,432 --> 00:32:17,399
Fall back!

441
00:33:16,025 --> 00:33:17,890
Distance to power generators?

442
00:33:17,994 --> 00:33:19,325
<i>17.28.</i>

443
00:33:28,438 --> 00:33:30,372
Target.
Maximum firepower.

444
00:33:56,032 --> 00:33:58,091
Transport, this is Solo.

445
00:33:58,201 --> 00:33:59,327
Better take off.
I can't get to you.

446
00:33:59,435 --> 00:34:00,333
<i>I'll get her out
on the Falcon.</i>

447
00:34:00,436 --> 00:34:01,368
Come on.

448
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:04,865
B-B-But where are
you going?

449
00:34:04,974 --> 00:34:06,032
Come back!

450
00:34:23,226 --> 00:34:24,853
Wait!

451
00:34:24,961 --> 00:34:26,861
Wait for me!
Wait! Stop!

452
00:34:26,963 --> 00:34:28,362
How typical.

453
00:34:28,464 --> 00:34:29,897
Come on.

454
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:31,762
Gahhh!

455
00:34:33,503 --> 00:34:34,731
Hurry up, goldenrod.

456
00:34:34,837 --> 00:34:37,101
You're gonna be
a permanent resident.

457
00:34:37,206 --> 00:34:38,605
Wait! Wait!

458
00:34:56,526 --> 00:34:57,550
How's this?

459
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,685
Would it help
if I got out and pushed?

460
00:34:59,796 --> 00:35:01,024
Captain Solo!
Captain Solo!

461
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,028
It might.

462
00:35:03,299 --> 00:35:05,995
Sir, might I suggest
that you...

463
00:35:06,102 --> 00:35:07,797
It can wait.

464
00:35:12,008 --> 00:35:14,272
This bucket of bolts is never gonna
get us past that blockade.

465
00:35:14,377 --> 00:35:16,709
This baby's got a few surprises
left in her, sweetheart.

466
00:35:25,087 --> 00:35:27,248
Come on! Come on!

467
00:35:27,356 --> 00:35:29,950
Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

468
00:35:32,595 --> 00:35:33,493
See?

469
00:35:33,596 --> 00:35:34,494
Someday you're
gonna be wrong...

470
00:35:34,597 --> 00:35:35,894
and I just hope
I'm there to see it.

471
00:35:38,768 --> 00:35:39,894
Punch it!

472
00:35:57,553 --> 00:35:59,020
R2!

473
00:35:59,121 --> 00:36:02,716
Get her ready
for takeoff.

474
00:36:02,825 --> 00:36:07,194
Good luck, Luke.
See you at the rendezvous.

475
00:36:08,798 --> 00:36:10,789
Don't worry, R2.

476
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,800
We're going.
We're going.

477
00:36:25,214 --> 00:36:26,681
There's nothing wrong, R2.

478
00:36:26,782 --> 00:36:28,841
I'm just setting
a new course.

479
00:36:31,521 --> 00:36:34,115
We're not gonna regroup
with the others.

480
00:36:34,223 --> 00:36:36,453
We're going
to the Dagobah system.

481
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:40,292
Yes, R2?

482
00:36:41,998 --> 00:36:43,625
That's all right.

483
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:46,201
I'd like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

484
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:02,783
Gahhh!

485
00:37:02,885 --> 00:37:04,045
I saw 'em! I saw 'em!

486
00:37:04,153 --> 00:37:05,279
Saw what?

487
00:37:05,388 --> 00:37:07,583
Stardestroyers,
two of 'em coming right at us.

488
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,782
Sir! Sir!

489
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:09,789
Might I suggest...

490
00:37:09,892 --> 00:37:12,156
Shut him up
or shut him down!

491
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:14,252
Check the deflector shield.

492
00:37:14,363 --> 00:37:16,263
Great.

493
00:37:16,365 --> 00:37:18,424
Well, we can still
outmaneuver them.

494
00:37:22,738 --> 00:37:24,638
Take evasive action!

495
00:37:36,252 --> 00:37:38,083
Prepare to make the jump to light speed.

496
00:37:38,187 --> 00:37:39,085
But, sir!

497
00:37:39,188 --> 00:37:41,782
They're getting closer.

498
00:37:41,891 --> 00:37:44,018
Oh, yeah?
Watch this.

499
00:37:47,129 --> 00:37:48,323
Watch what?

500
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:51,357
I think we're
in trouble.

501
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:53,401
If I may say so, sir,
I noticed earlier...

502
00:37:53,502 --> 00:37:55,129
the hyperdrive motivator
has been damaged.

503
00:37:55,237 --> 00:37:57,000
It's impossible to go
to light speed.

504
00:37:57,106 --> 00:37:59,666
We're in trouble.

505
00:38:02,912 --> 00:38:04,174
Horizontal boosters!

506
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,214
Gahhh!

507
00:38:06,315 --> 00:38:08,374
Alluvial dampers.

508
00:38:08,484 --> 00:38:10,145
Ow!

509
00:38:10,252 --> 00:38:12,186
That's not it.

510
00:38:12,288 --> 00:38:13,846
Bring me
the hydrospanner!

511
00:38:15,825 --> 00:38:19,226
I don't know how we're gonna
get out of this one.

512
00:38:21,564 --> 00:38:22,792
Ow!

513
00:38:22,898 --> 00:38:23,990
Chewie!

514
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,694
That wasn't a laser blast.
Something hit us.

515
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:31,238
Han, get up here!

516
00:38:32,942 --> 00:38:34,409
Come on, Chewie!

517
00:38:34,577 --> 00:38:36,238
Asteroids.

518
00:38:36,345 --> 00:38:39,781
Oh, no.

519
00:38:39,882 --> 00:38:41,281
Chewie,
set two-seven-one.

520
00:38:41,384 --> 00:38:42,817
What are you doing?

521
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:46,513
You're not actually going
into an asteroid field?

522
00:38:46,622 --> 00:38:49,455
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

523
00:38:51,594 --> 00:38:53,528
You don't have to do this
to impress me.

524
00:38:53,629 --> 00:38:56,189
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field...

525
00:38:56,298 --> 00:38:58,391
is approximately 3,720 to 1.

526
00:38:58,501 --> 00:39:00,196
Never tell me the odds!

527
00:39:22,391 --> 00:39:24,120
Look out!

528
00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:30,130
You said you wanted to be around
when I made a mistake.

529
00:39:30,232 --> 00:39:32,063
This could be it,
sweetheart.

530
00:39:32,168 --> 00:39:33,066
I take it back.

531
00:39:33,169 --> 00:39:34,727
We're going
to get pulverized...

532
00:39:34,837 --> 00:39:36,168
if we stay out here
much longer.

533
00:39:36,272 --> 00:39:37,466
Ain't gonna argue with that.

534
00:39:37,573 --> 00:39:40,133
I'm going in closer
to one of the big ones.

535
00:39:40,242 --> 00:39:41,106
Closer?!

536
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:42,108
Closer?!

537
00:39:42,211 --> 00:39:43,269
Gahhh!

538
00:40:09,205 --> 00:40:11,105
Oh, this is suicide!
There's nowhere to go.

539
00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:13,175
There. That looks
pretty good.

540
00:40:13,275 --> 00:40:15,436
What looks pretty good?

541
00:40:15,544 --> 00:40:17,444
Yeah,
that'll do nicely.

542
00:40:17,546 --> 00:40:20,640
Excuse me, ma'am,
but where are we going?

543
00:40:30,593 --> 00:40:33,153
I hope you know
what you're doing.

544
00:40:33,262 --> 00:40:34,354
Yeah. Me, too.

545
00:40:43,038 --> 00:40:45,438
Yep, that's it.
Dagobah.

546
00:40:47,877 --> 00:40:50,107
No, I'm not gonna change
my mind about this.

547
00:40:50,212 --> 00:40:53,511
I'm not picking up
any cities or technology.

548
00:40:53,616 --> 00:40:56,176
Massive life-form
readings, though.

549
00:40:56,285 --> 00:40:58,810
There's something alive
down there.

550
00:41:00,456 --> 00:41:03,357
Yes. I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.

551
00:41:09,932 --> 00:41:11,900
I know! I know!

552
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:15,493
All the scopes are dead.
I can't see a thing.

553
00:41:15,604 --> 00:41:16,866
Just hang on.

554
00:41:16,972 --> 00:41:18,735
I'm gonna start
the landing cycle.

555
00:42:12,494 --> 00:42:13,586
No, R2, you stay put.

556
00:42:13,696 --> 00:42:15,425
I'll have a look around.

557
00:42:19,902 --> 00:42:22,166
R2?

558
00:42:22,271 --> 00:42:23,169
R2!

559
00:42:25,207 --> 00:42:26,196
Where are you?

560
00:42:29,712 --> 00:42:31,179
R2!

561
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,619
You be more careful.

562
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:45,458
R2, that way.

563
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:14,854
R2!

564
00:43:29,505 --> 00:43:31,097
<i>Beeep!</i>

565
00:43:42,584 --> 00:43:43,949
Oh, no.

566
00:43:44,053 --> 00:43:45,953
Are you all right?

567
00:43:46,055 --> 00:43:47,454
Come on.

568
00:43:50,693 --> 00:43:52,888
You were lucky
to get out of there.

569
00:43:52,995 --> 00:43:55,020
Anything broken?

570
00:43:58,667 --> 00:44:01,397
If you're saying
coming here was a bad idea...

571
00:44:01,503 --> 00:44:02,902
I'm beginning
to agree with you.

572
00:44:04,606 --> 00:44:06,733
R2, what are
we doing here?

573
00:44:06,842 --> 00:44:12,337
It's like... something
out of a dream or...

574
00:44:12,448 --> 00:44:14,040
I don't know.

575
00:44:14,149 --> 00:44:16,515
Maybe I'm
just going crazy.

576
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,744
Yes, Admiral?

577
00:44:49,852 --> 00:44:52,650
<i>Our ships have sighted
the Millennium Falcon, lord...</i>

578
00:44:52,755 --> 00:44:55,849
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk...

579
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:58,085
Asteroids do not
concern me, Admiral.

580
00:44:58,193 --> 00:45:01,390
I want that ship,
not excuses.

581
00:45:01,497 --> 00:45:03,556
Yes, lord.

582
00:45:07,536 --> 00:45:09,527
I'm gonna shut down
everything...

583
00:45:09,638 --> 00:45:11,503
but the emergency
power systems.

584
00:45:11,607 --> 00:45:15,634
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask,
but does that include shutting me down, too?

585
00:45:15,744 --> 00:45:18,042
<i>No. I need you to talk
to the Falcon.</i>

586
00:45:18,147 --> 00:45:21,207
Find out what's wrong
with the hyperdrive.

587
00:45:27,923 --> 00:45:31,324
Sir, it's quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

588
00:45:31,427 --> 00:45:33,759
Not entirely stable?

589
00:45:33,862 --> 00:45:35,523
I'm glad you're here
to tell us these things.

590
00:45:35,631 --> 00:45:37,360
Chewie, take the professor
in the back...

591
00:45:37,466 --> 00:45:39,058
and plug him into
the hyperdrive.

592
00:45:39,168 --> 00:45:42,069
Sometimes I just don't
understand human behavior.

593
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:44,537
After all, I'm only
trying to do my job.

594
00:45:49,378 --> 00:45:50,743
- Let go.
- Shh!

595
00:45:52,614 --> 00:45:53,842
Let go, please.

596
00:45:53,949 --> 00:45:55,246
Don't get excited.

597
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,783
Captain, being held by you...

598
00:45:56,885 --> 00:45:59,115
isn't quite enough
to get me excited.

599
00:45:59,221 --> 00:46:00,620
Sorry, sweetheart.

600
00:46:00,722 --> 00:46:03,520
I haven't got time
for anything else.

601
00:46:38,193 --> 00:46:39,956
Ready for
some power?

602
00:46:40,062 --> 00:46:41,723
O.K.

603
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:46,466
Let's see now.

604
00:46:46,568 --> 00:46:48,365
Put that in there.

605
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:49,562
There you go.

606
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,301
Now all I gotta do
is find this Yoda...

607
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:56,877
if he even exists.

608
00:47:03,085 --> 00:47:07,181
It's really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

609
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:09,587
This place
gives me the creeps.

610
00:47:13,228 --> 00:47:16,288
Still...

611
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:18,229
there's something familiar
about this place.

612
00:47:20,435 --> 00:47:21,868
I don't know.

613
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,096
I feel like...

614
00:47:23,205 --> 00:47:25,400
Feel like what?

615
00:47:25,507 --> 00:47:27,134
Like we're
being watched!

616
00:47:27,242 --> 00:47:29,039
Away put your weapon!

617
00:47:29,144 --> 00:47:31,169
I mean you no harm.

618
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,181
I am wondering...
why are you here?

619
00:47:34,283 --> 00:47:37,275
I'm looking
for someone.

620
00:47:37,386 --> 00:47:38,785
Looking?

621
00:47:38,887 --> 00:47:41,651
Found someone you have,
I would say, hmmm?

622
00:47:41,757 --> 00:47:44,419
Right.

623
00:47:44,526 --> 00:47:47,757
Help you I can.
Yes, mmmm.

624
00:47:47,863 --> 00:47:49,831
I don't think so.

625
00:47:49,932 --> 00:47:52,833
I'm looking
for a great warrior.

626
00:47:52,935 --> 00:47:54,163
Ah!

627
00:47:54,269 --> 00:47:56,100
A great warrior.

628
00:47:56,205 --> 00:47:58,605
Ha ha ha!

629
00:47:58,707 --> 00:48:01,073
Wars not
make one great.

630
00:48:09,017 --> 00:48:10,814
Put that down.

631
00:48:10,919 --> 00:48:13,387
Hey! That's my dinner!

632
00:48:16,124 --> 00:48:19,423
How you get so big
eating food of this kind?

633
00:48:19,528 --> 00:48:22,088
Listen, friend, we didn't mean
to land in that puddle.

634
00:48:22,197 --> 00:48:23,391
And if we could get
our ship out, we would.

635
00:48:23,498 --> 00:48:24,556
But we can't,
so why don't you...

636
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:26,566
Cannot get your ship out.
Hee hee hee!

637
00:48:26,668 --> 00:48:27,999
Hey, get out of there!

638
00:48:28,103 --> 00:48:29,434
Ah!

639
00:48:29,538 --> 00:48:31,563
No! Ooh!

640
00:48:31,673 --> 00:48:34,005
Hey, you could
have broken this.

641
00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:36,236
Don't do that.

642
00:48:38,046 --> 00:48:39,570
Oh!

643
00:48:46,555 --> 00:48:48,523
You're making a mess.

644
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,356
Hey, give me that!

645
00:48:52,461 --> 00:48:55,021
Mine, or I will
help you not.

646
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:56,927
I don't want your help.
I want my lamp back.

647
00:48:57,032 --> 00:48:59,057
I'm gonna need it
to get out of this slimy mudhole.

648
00:48:59,167 --> 00:49:00,566
Mudhole? Slimy?

649
00:49:00,669 --> 00:49:03,297
My home this is...

650
00:49:03,405 --> 00:49:05,873
Wha... Mmm!

651
00:49:05,974 --> 00:49:07,566
R2, let him have it.

652
00:49:09,544 --> 00:49:11,910
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

653
00:49:12,014 --> 00:49:13,072
R2!

654
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,748
Now, will you move along,
little fellow?

655
00:49:17,853 --> 00:49:19,514
We've got a lot
of work to do.

656
00:49:19,621 --> 00:49:21,088
No! No, no!

657
00:49:21,189 --> 00:49:24,590
Stay and help you I will...
find your friend.

658
00:49:24,693 --> 00:49:26,991
I'm not looking
for a friend.

659
00:49:27,095 --> 00:49:28,357
I'm looking
for a Jedi master.

660
00:49:28,463 --> 00:49:32,729
Oh. Jedi master. Yoda.

661
00:49:32,834 --> 00:49:34,301
You seek Yoda.

662
00:49:34,403 --> 00:49:35,563
You know him?

663
00:49:35,671 --> 00:49:39,072
Mmmm.
Take you to him I will.

664
00:49:39,174 --> 00:49:43,770
Yes, yes, but now
we must eat. Come.

665
00:49:43,879 --> 00:49:45,506
Good food.

666
00:49:45,614 --> 00:49:46,979
Come.

667
00:49:56,124 --> 00:49:57,989
Come, come.

668
00:49:59,361 --> 00:50:04,162
R2... stay and watch
after the camp.

669
00:50:17,245 --> 00:50:19,907
Oh! Where is R2
when I need him?

670
00:50:20,015 --> 00:50:23,075
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate...

671
00:50:23,185 --> 00:50:24,846
but it has the most
peculiar dialect.

672
00:50:24,953 --> 00:50:26,978
I believe, sir, it says
that the power coupling...

673
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:28,488
on the negative axis
has been polarized.

674
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:31,081
I'm afraid you'll have
to replace it.

675
00:50:31,193 --> 00:50:34,424
Well, of course I'll
have to replace it.

676
00:50:34,529 --> 00:50:36,019
Here!

677
00:50:36,131 --> 00:50:37,860
And, Chewie...

678
00:50:39,601 --> 00:50:42,195
I think we'd better replace
the negative power coupling.

679
00:51:03,325 --> 00:51:07,261
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.

680
00:51:07,362 --> 00:51:09,694
Would you please
stop calling me that?

681
00:51:09,798 --> 00:51:11,891
Sure, Leia.

682
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,025
You make it
so difficult sometimes.

683
00:51:14,136 --> 00:51:16,070
I do. I really do.

684
00:51:16,171 --> 00:51:19,072
You could be a little nicer, though.

685
00:51:19,174 --> 00:51:22,041
Come on, admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

686
00:51:23,645 --> 00:51:26,045
Occasionally... maybe...

687
00:51:26,148 --> 00:51:28,708
when you aren't acting
like a scoundrel.

688
00:51:28,817 --> 00:51:30,580
Scoundrel?

689
00:51:30,685 --> 00:51:32,175
Scoundrel?

690
00:51:34,523 --> 00:51:37,048
I like the sound
of that.

691
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:38,023
Stop that.

692
00:51:38,126 --> 00:51:39,855
Stop what?

693
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:42,020
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.

694
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:44,530
My hands are dirty, too.
What are you afraid of?

695
00:51:44,633 --> 00:51:45,793
Afraid?

696
00:51:45,901 --> 00:51:47,801
You're trembling.

697
00:51:47,903 --> 00:51:49,564
I'm not trembling.

698
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:53,835
You like me because
I'm a scoundrel.

699
00:51:53,942 --> 00:51:55,967
There aren't enough
scoundrels in your life.

700
00:51:56,077 --> 00:51:58,568
I happen to like nice men.

701
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,647
I'm a nice man.

702
00:51:59,748 --> 00:52:01,443
No, you're not. You're...

703
00:52:04,085 --> 00:52:05,177
Sir, sir!

704
00:52:05,287 --> 00:52:07,949
I've isolated
the reverse power flux coupling.

705
00:52:10,192 --> 00:52:11,420
Thank you.

706
00:52:11,526 --> 00:52:12,891
Thank you very much.

707
00:52:12,994 --> 00:52:14,723
Oh, you're perfectly
welcome, sir.

708
00:52:20,802 --> 00:52:24,033
And that was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.

709
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:25,663
Considering the amount of
damage we've sustained...

710
00:52:25,774 --> 00:52:26,968
they must have been
destroyed.

711
00:52:27,075 --> 00:52:29,771
No, Captain.
They're alive.

712
00:52:29,878 --> 00:52:31,812
I want every ship
available...

713
00:52:31,913 --> 00:52:33,471
to sweep
the asteroid field...

714
00:52:33,582 --> 00:52:34,879
until they are found.

715
00:52:38,887 --> 00:52:40,184
Lord Vader.

716
00:52:40,288 --> 00:52:42,188
Yes, Admiral.
What is it?

717
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:43,689
The emperor
commands you...

718
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:45,191
to make contact
with him.

719
00:52:45,293 --> 00:52:47,124
Move the ship out of
the asteroid field...

720
00:52:47,229 --> 00:52:50,130
so that we can send
a clear transmission.

721
00:52:50,232 --> 00:52:51,699
Yes, my lord.

722
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:10,643
What is thy bidding,
my master?

723
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:14,447
There is a great
disturbance...

724
00:53:14,556 --> 00:53:16,820
in the Force.

725
00:53:16,925 --> 00:53:19,257
I have felt it.

726
00:53:19,361 --> 00:53:21,852
We have
a new enemy...

727
00:53:21,963 --> 00:53:25,990
the young rebel
who destroyed the Death Star.

728
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:29,434
I have no doubt
this boy...

729
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:33,770
is the offspring
of Anakin Skywalker.

730
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:36,139
How is that possible?

731
00:53:36,244 --> 00:53:39,736
Search your feelings,
Lord Vader.

732
00:53:39,848 --> 00:53:42,976
You will know it
to be true.

733
00:53:43,084 --> 00:53:45,552
He could destroy us.

734
00:53:45,654 --> 00:53:47,849
He's just a boy.

735
00:53:47,956 --> 00:53:50,356
Obi-Wan can no longer
help him.

736
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:54,121
The Force
is strong with him.

737
00:53:55,463 --> 00:53:57,488
The son of Skywalker...

738
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,363
must not become a Jedi.

739
00:54:00,468 --> 00:54:02,698
If he could be turned...

740
00:54:02,804 --> 00:54:05,637
he would become
a powerful ally.

741
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:08,300
Yes.

742
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:13,507
He would be
a great asset.

743
00:54:13,615 --> 00:54:15,981
Can it be done?

744
00:54:16,084 --> 00:54:19,986
He will join us
or die, master.

745
00:54:36,605 --> 00:54:37,936
Look,
I'm sure it's delicious.

746
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:40,940
I just don't understand
why we can't see Yoda now.

747
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:41,940
Patience!

748
00:54:42,043 --> 00:54:43,442
For the Jedi...

749
00:54:43,545 --> 00:54:45,342
it is time
to eat as well.

750
00:54:45,447 --> 00:54:47,347
Hmm? Heh heh.

751
00:54:47,449 --> 00:54:50,612
Eat, eat.

752
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:51,777
Hot!

753
00:54:59,461 --> 00:55:01,486
Good food!
Mmm, good, hmm?

754
00:55:01,596 --> 00:55:04,656
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

755
00:55:04,766 --> 00:55:06,461
Not far.
Yoda not far.

756
00:55:06,568 --> 00:55:09,765
Patience. Soon you
will be with him.

757
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,832
Root leaf.

758
00:55:13,942 --> 00:55:15,307
I cook.

759
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:19,813
Why wish you
become Jedi? Hmm? Hmm?

760
00:55:19,914 --> 00:55:22,041
Mostly because of
my father, I guess.

761
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:23,378
Ah, father.

762
00:55:23,485 --> 00:55:25,885
Powerful Jedi was he.

763
00:55:25,987 --> 00:55:27,887
Hee hee.
Mmm, powerful Jedi.

764
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:29,650
Oh, come on.

765
00:55:29,758 --> 00:55:31,225
How could you
know my father?

766
00:55:31,326 --> 00:55:33,055
You don't
even know who I am.

767
00:55:33,161 --> 00:55:35,061
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

768
00:55:35,163 --> 00:55:36,926
We're wasting our time!

769
00:55:38,033 --> 00:55:39,864
I cannot teach him.

770
00:55:39,968 --> 00:55:42,368
The boy
has no patience.

771
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:45,098
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

772
00:55:45,206 --> 00:55:46,264
Hmm...

773
00:55:49,878 --> 00:55:52,346
Much anger in him...

774
00:55:52,447 --> 00:55:54,347
like his father.

775
00:55:54,449 --> 00:55:58,180
<i>Was I any different
when you taught me?</i>

776
00:55:59,587 --> 00:56:01,350
No.

777
00:56:01,456 --> 00:56:03,321
He is not ready.

778
00:56:03,425 --> 00:56:04,687
Yoda.

779
00:56:06,928 --> 00:56:08,293
I am ready.

780
00:56:08,396 --> 00:56:10,660
Ben...
I can be a Jedi.

781
00:56:10,765 --> 00:56:12,699
Ben, tell him I'm...

782
00:56:12,801 --> 00:56:14,200
Ready, are you?

783
00:56:14,302 --> 00:56:16,600
What know you ready?

784
00:56:16,705 --> 00:56:20,072
For 800 years
have I trained Jedi.

785
00:56:20,175 --> 00:56:22,700
My own counsel will I keep...

786
00:56:22,811 --> 00:56:25,644
on who is to be trained.

787
00:56:25,747 --> 00:56:30,377
A Jedi must have
the deepest commitment, hmm?

788
00:56:30,485 --> 00:56:32,350
The most serious mind.

789
00:56:34,122 --> 00:56:38,183
This one a long time
have I watched.

790
00:56:38,293 --> 00:56:41,285
All his life
has he looked away...

791
00:56:41,396 --> 00:56:44,456
to the future,
to the horizon.

792
00:56:44,566 --> 00:56:48,127
Never his mind
on where he was...

793
00:56:48,236 --> 00:56:49,328
hmm?

794
00:56:49,437 --> 00:56:51,371
What he was doing.

795
00:56:51,473 --> 00:56:53,031
Hmph!

796
00:56:53,141 --> 00:56:54,199
Adventure.

797
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:55,367
Ha!

798
00:56:55,477 --> 00:56:56,876
Excitement. Ha!

799
00:56:56,978 --> 00:56:59,572
A Jedi craves
not these things.

800
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:02,343
You are reckless!

801
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:05,419
<i>So was I,
if you remember.</i>

802
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,421
He is too old.

803
00:57:08,523 --> 00:57:11,219
Yes, too old to
begin the training.

804
00:57:11,326 --> 00:57:13,817
But I've learned so much.

805
00:57:17,465 --> 00:57:18,693
Ahh...

806
00:57:20,268 --> 00:57:23,169
Will he finish
what he begins?

807
00:57:23,271 --> 00:57:24,898
I won't fail you.

808
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:28,102
I'm not afraid.

809
00:57:29,677 --> 00:57:30,871
Oh...

810
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,380
You will be.

811
00:57:35,817 --> 00:57:37,876
You will be.

812
00:58:18,553 --> 00:58:19,815
Aah!

813
00:58:19,921 --> 00:58:21,855
Sir, if I may venture
an opinion...

814
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,924
I'm not really interested
in your opinion.

815
00:58:24,025 --> 00:58:25,322
There's something
out there.

816
00:58:25,426 --> 00:58:26,586
Where?

817
00:58:26,694 --> 00:58:27,661
Outside in the cave.

818
00:58:29,364 --> 00:58:30,729
There it is.
Listen. Listen!

819
00:58:30,832 --> 00:58:31,821
I'm going out there.

820
00:58:31,933 --> 00:58:32,900
Are you crazy?

821
00:58:33,001 --> 00:58:34,366
I just got this bucket
back together.

822
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,562
I'm not going to let
something tear it apart.

823
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,366
Then I'm going
with you.

824
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,065
I think it might
be better...

825
00:58:40,174 --> 00:58:42,267
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

826
00:58:42,377 --> 00:58:43,275
Oh, no.

827
00:58:57,258 --> 00:59:00,489
This ground
sure feels strange.

828
00:59:00,595 --> 00:59:03,063
It doesn't
feel like rock.

829
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:09,993
There's an awful lot
of moisture in here.

830
00:59:10,104 --> 00:59:11,901
I don't know.

831
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,998
I have a bad feeling
about this.

832
00:59:15,109 --> 00:59:16,235
Yeah.

833
00:59:17,912 --> 00:59:18,844
Watch out!

834
00:59:20,081 --> 00:59:21,343
It's all right.

835
00:59:21,449 --> 00:59:22,473
It's all right.

836
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:24,483
Yeah, that's what
I thought... mynock.

837
00:59:24,585 --> 00:59:26,348
Chewie, check the rest
of the ship...

838
00:59:26,454 --> 00:59:28,786
and make sure there are
no more attached...

839
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:31,120
chewing
on the power cables.

840
00:59:31,225 --> 00:59:32,487
Mynocks.

841
00:59:32,593 --> 00:59:34,823
Go on inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

842
00:59:39,334 --> 00:59:41,063
Han!

843
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:45,366
Aagghh! Go away, go away,
beastly thing!

844
00:59:45,473 --> 00:59:46,462
Shoo! Shoo!

845
00:59:53,348 --> 00:59:55,248
Wait a minute...

846
01:00:17,038 --> 01:00:18,335
Let's get out of here!

847
01:00:18,439 --> 01:00:20,600
The Empire is still out there!
I don't think...

848
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:22,903
No time to discuss this
in committee!

849
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:25,001
I'm not a committee!

850
01:00:31,018 --> 01:00:33,919
You can't make the jump to light speed
in this asteroid field.

851
01:00:34,021 --> 01:00:36,683
Sit down, sweetheart!
We're taking off!

852
01:00:40,495 --> 01:00:41,462
Look!

853
01:00:41,562 --> 01:00:42,859
I see it.
I see it.

854
01:00:42,964 --> 01:00:43,931
We're doomed!

855
01:00:44,031 --> 01:00:45,362
The cave is collapsing.

856
01:00:45,466 --> 01:00:47,366
- This is no cave.
- What?

857
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:22,279
Run!

858
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:26,225
Yes! A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

859
01:01:26,329 --> 01:01:28,957
But beware
of the dark side.

860
01:01:29,065 --> 01:01:30,726
Anger, fear,
aggression...

861
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:33,893
The dark side of
the Force are they...

862
01:01:34,003 --> 01:01:36,972
easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

863
01:01:37,073 --> 01:01:39,803
If once you start down
the dark path...

864
01:01:39,909 --> 01:01:41,968
forever will it dominate
your destiny.

865
01:01:42,078 --> 01:01:43,477
Consume you it will...

866
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:45,376
as it did Obi-Wan's
apprentice.

867
01:01:45,481 --> 01:01:46,880
Vader.

868
01:01:46,983 --> 01:01:49,178
Is the dark side
stronger?

869
01:01:49,285 --> 01:01:50,718
No, no.

870
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:52,185
No.

871
01:01:52,288 --> 01:01:54,688
Quicker, easier,
more seductive.

872
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:57,657
How do I know the good side
from the bad?

873
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,991
You will know
when you are calm...

874
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:02,997
at peace...

875
01:02:03,099 --> 01:02:04,726
passive.

876
01:02:04,834 --> 01:02:08,065
A Jedi
uses the Force...

877
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:09,865
for knowledge
and defense...

878
01:02:09,972 --> 01:02:12,099
never for attack.

879
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:13,197
But tell me why
I can't...

880
01:02:13,309 --> 01:02:15,402
No, no.
There is no why.

881
01:02:15,511 --> 01:02:18,241
Nothing more will I
teach you today.

882
01:02:18,347 --> 01:02:20,838
Clear your mind
of questions.

883
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:24,681
Hmm...

884
01:02:24,787 --> 01:02:26,379
Mmm...

885
01:02:43,205 --> 01:02:45,332
There's something
not right here.

886
01:02:49,011 --> 01:02:51,206
I feel cold...

887
01:02:51,314 --> 01:02:52,440
death.

888
01:02:52,548 --> 01:02:54,607
That place...

889
01:02:54,717 --> 01:02:57,914
is strong with
the dark side of the Force.

890
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,284
A domain of evil it is.

891
01:03:02,291 --> 01:03:03,656
In you must go.

892
01:03:03,759 --> 01:03:06,091
What's in there?

893
01:03:08,097 --> 01:03:10,088
Only what
you take with you.

894
01:03:14,503 --> 01:03:16,130
Your weapons...

895
01:03:16,238 --> 01:03:18,468
you will not need them.

896
01:05:46,956 --> 01:05:47,980
Hmph...

897
01:05:58,067 --> 01:05:58,965
Bounty hunters.

898
01:05:59,068 --> 01:06:00,467
We don't need
their scum.

899
01:06:00,569 --> 01:06:01,968
Yes, sir.

900
01:06:02,071 --> 01:06:04,062
Those rebels
won't escape us.

901
01:06:09,745 --> 01:06:12,179
Sir, we have
a priority signal...

902
01:06:12,281 --> 01:06:14,112
<i>from the
Stardestroyer Avenger.</i>

903
01:06:14,216 --> 01:06:17,185
There will be
a substantial reward...

904
01:06:17,286 --> 01:06:19,186
for the one
who finds...

905
01:06:19,288 --> 01:06:21,188
<i>the Millennium Falcon.</i>

906
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:23,815
You are free to use
any methods necessary...

907
01:06:23,926 --> 01:06:26,087
but I want them alive.

908
01:06:26,195 --> 01:06:28,629
No disintegrations.

909
01:06:28,731 --> 01:06:30,596
As you wish.

910
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:31,927
Lord Vader.

911
01:06:32,034 --> 01:06:34,696
My lord,
we have them.

912
01:06:39,241 --> 01:06:41,004
Oh, thank goodness
we're coming out of...

913
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:42,338
the asteroid field.

914
01:06:46,048 --> 01:06:47,879
Let's get out of here.

915
01:06:47,983 --> 01:06:49,450
Ready for light speed?

916
01:06:49,552 --> 01:06:50,780
1...

917
01:06:50,886 --> 01:06:52,513
2...

918
01:06:52,621 --> 01:06:53,781
3!

919
01:06:59,862 --> 01:07:01,159
It's not fair.

920
01:07:01,263 --> 01:07:02,662
Gahhh!

921
01:07:02,765 --> 01:07:04,790
Transfer circuits
aren't working.

922
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,027
It's not my fault!

923
01:07:07,136 --> 01:07:08,125
No light speed?

924
01:07:08,237 --> 01:07:10,068
It's not my fault.

925
01:07:14,844 --> 01:07:16,869
Sir, we've just lost
the main rear deflector shield.

926
01:07:16,979 --> 01:07:19,243
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we're done for.

927
01:07:19,348 --> 01:07:21,077
Turn her around.

928
01:07:21,183 --> 01:07:23,413
I'm going to put all power
in the front shield.

929
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,816
You're going to
attack them?

930
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,014
Sir, the odds of surviving
a direct assault on an imperial...

931
01:07:28,123 --> 01:07:30,057
- Shut up!
- Gaahh!

932
01:07:36,532 --> 01:07:38,523
They're moving to
attack position.

933
01:07:40,703 --> 01:07:41,829
Shields up.

934
01:07:46,542 --> 01:07:47,941
Track them.

935
01:07:48,043 --> 01:07:50,102
They may come around
for another pass.

936
01:07:50,212 --> 01:07:52,612
Captain Needa, the ship
no longer appears on our scopes.

937
01:07:52,715 --> 01:07:54,615
They can't
have disappeared.

938
01:07:54,717 --> 01:07:57,242
No ship that small
has a cloaking device.

939
01:07:57,353 --> 01:07:59,218
Well, there's no trace
of them, sir.

940
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:01,221
Captain, Lord Vader demands
an update on the pursuit.

941
01:08:03,759 --> 01:08:05,454
Get a shuttle ready.

942
01:08:05,561 --> 01:08:08,155
I shall assume full responsibility
for losing them...

943
01:08:08,264 --> 01:08:09,891
and apologize
to Lord Vader.

944
01:08:09,999 --> 01:08:11,899
Meanwhile, continue
to scan the area.

945
01:08:12,001 --> 01:08:13,525
Yes, Captain Needa.

946
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,606
Use the Force.

947
01:08:20,709 --> 01:08:21,607
Yes.

948
01:08:27,216 --> 01:08:28,911
Now, the stone...

949
01:08:32,488 --> 01:08:34,513
Feel it.

950
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:48,299
Concentrate!

951
01:09:02,551 --> 01:09:06,009
Oh, no. We'll never
get it out now.

952
01:09:06,121 --> 01:09:07,850
So certain are you.

953
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:14,620
Always with you
it cannot be done.

954
01:09:16,432 --> 01:09:18,366
Hear you nothing
that I say?

955
01:09:18,467 --> 01:09:20,958
Master, moving stones around
is one thing.

956
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:22,537
This is totally
different.

957
01:09:22,638 --> 01:09:24,265
No! No different!

958
01:09:24,373 --> 01:09:26,739
Only different
in your mind.

959
01:09:26,842 --> 01:09:30,471
You must unlearn
what you have learned.

960
01:09:30,579 --> 01:09:33,104
All right.
I'll give it a try.

961
01:09:33,215 --> 01:09:34,944
No! Try not.

962
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:37,280
Do.

963
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:38,683
Or do not.

964
01:09:38,787 --> 01:09:40,721
There is no try.

965
01:10:28,303 --> 01:10:31,136
I can't.
It's too big.

966
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:34,141
Size matters not.
Look at me.

967
01:10:34,243 --> 01:10:37,576
Judge me by my size,
do you?

968
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:38,703
Hmm?

969
01:10:38,814 --> 01:10:40,213
Hmph!

970
01:10:40,315 --> 01:10:42,545
And well you should not...

971
01:10:42,651 --> 01:10:45,779
for my ally is the Force.

972
01:10:45,888 --> 01:10:48,823
And a powerful
ally it is.

973
01:10:48,924 --> 01:10:51,119
Life creates it...

974
01:10:51,226 --> 01:10:52,818
makes it grow.

975
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:57,827
Its energy surrounds us...

976
01:10:57,933 --> 01:10:59,833
and binds us.

977
01:10:59,935 --> 01:11:02,062
Luminous beings are we...

978
01:11:02,171 --> 01:11:04,105
not this crude matter.

979
01:11:04,206 --> 01:11:08,267
You must feel
the Force around you...

980
01:11:08,377 --> 01:11:11,744
Here,
between you, me...

981
01:11:11,847 --> 01:11:13,007
the tree...

982
01:11:13,115 --> 01:11:14,878
the rock...

983
01:11:14,983 --> 01:11:15,711
everywhere!

984
01:11:15,818 --> 01:11:17,080
Yes...

985
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:22,554
even between the land
and the ship.

986
01:11:26,628 --> 01:11:28,596
You want the impossible.

987
01:13:03,158 --> 01:13:05,023
Mm...

988
01:13:16,171 --> 01:13:17,069
I don't...

989
01:13:17,172 --> 01:13:19,265
I don't believe it.

990
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:23,309
That is why you fail.

991
01:13:42,364 --> 01:13:46,460
Apology accepted,
Captain Needa.

992
01:13:54,142 --> 01:13:57,703
Lord Vader, our ships have completed
their scan of the area and found nothing.

993
01:13:57,813 --> 01:13:59,474
<i>If the Millennium Falcon
went into light speed...</i>

994
01:13:59,581 --> 01:14:02,141
it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy by now.

995
01:14:02,251 --> 01:14:03,149
Alert all commands.

996
01:14:03,252 --> 01:14:05,152
Calculate every
possible destination...

997
01:14:05,254 --> 01:14:08,485
along their last known
trajectory.

998
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:09,921
Yes, my lord.
We'll find them.

999
01:14:10,025 --> 01:14:11,993
Don't fail me again...

1000
01:14:13,095 --> 01:14:14,187
Admiral.

1001
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:17,631
Alert all commands.

1002
01:14:17,733 --> 01:14:19,598
Deploy the fleet.

1003
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:36,881
Captain Solo,
this time you've gone too far.

1004
01:14:36,985 --> 01:14:38,350
Gahhh!

1005
01:14:38,453 --> 01:14:41,013
I will not be quiet.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

1006
01:14:41,123 --> 01:14:43,023
The fleet's beginning
to break up.

1007
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:44,820
Go back and stand by
the manual release...

1008
01:14:44,926 --> 01:14:47,224
for the landing claw.

1009
01:14:49,598 --> 01:14:51,566
I really don't see
how that's going to help.

1010
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:54,898
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

1011
01:14:55,003 --> 01:14:56,903
The Empire
may be gracious enough...

1012
01:14:57,005 --> 01:14:57,903
Thank you.

1013
01:14:58,006 --> 01:14:59,667
What's your next move?

1014
01:14:59,775 --> 01:15:01,208
If they follow standard
imperial procedure...

1015
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:02,709
they'll dump their garbage...

1016
01:15:02,811 --> 01:15:04,244
before they go to
light speed...

1017
01:15:04,346 --> 01:15:05,745
and then we just
float away.

1018
01:15:05,847 --> 01:15:07,405
With the rest
of the garbage.

1019
01:15:07,516 --> 01:15:08,881
Then what?

1020
01:15:08,984 --> 01:15:11,714
Then we got to find a safe port
somewhere around here.

1021
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:12,718
Any ideas?

1022
01:15:12,821 --> 01:15:14,254
Where are we?

1023
01:15:14,356 --> 01:15:15,755
The Anoat system.

1024
01:15:15,857 --> 01:15:17,757
There's not
much there.

1025
01:15:17,859 --> 01:15:21,727
No. Well, wait.
This is interesting.

1026
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:22,922
Lando.

1027
01:15:23,031 --> 01:15:24,430
Lando system?

1028
01:15:24,533 --> 01:15:27,434
Lando's not a system.
He's a man. Lando Calrissian.

1029
01:15:27,536 --> 01:15:29,936
He's a cardplayer,
gambler, scoundrel.

1030
01:15:30,038 --> 01:15:31,335
You'd like him.

1031
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,771
Thanks.

1032
01:15:32,874 --> 01:15:36,571
Bespin. It's pretty far,
but I think we can make it.

1033
01:15:36,678 --> 01:15:38,612
A mining colony?

1034
01:15:38,714 --> 01:15:41,114
Yeah, a tibanna
gas mine.

1035
01:15:41,216 --> 01:15:44,117
Lando conned
somebody out of it.

1036
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:47,017
We go back a long way,
Lando and me.

1037
01:15:47,122 --> 01:15:49,056
Can you trust him?

1038
01:15:49,157 --> 01:15:52,388
No. But he's got no
love for the Empire...

1039
01:15:52,494 --> 01:15:53,893
I can tell you that.

1040
01:15:53,995 --> 01:15:56,486
Here we go, Chewie.
Stand by.

1041
01:15:56,598 --> 01:15:57,587
Detach.

1042
01:16:04,339 --> 01:16:06,364
You do have your moments.

1043
01:16:06,475 --> 01:16:08,375
Not many of them...

1044
01:16:08,477 --> 01:16:10,843
but you do have them.

1045
01:16:43,845 --> 01:16:46,370
Concentrate.

1046
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:49,609
Feel the Force flow.

1047
01:16:49,718 --> 01:16:51,879
Yes.

1048
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:00,418
Good.

1049
01:17:00,529 --> 01:17:01,894
Calm.

1050
01:17:01,997 --> 01:17:04,158
Yes.

1051
01:17:04,299 --> 01:17:07,632
Through the Force,
things you will see.

1052
01:17:07,736 --> 01:17:11,263
Other places.
The future. The past.

1053
01:17:11,373 --> 01:17:13,807
Old friends long gone.

1054
01:17:16,211 --> 01:17:17,473
Han?

1055
01:17:17,579 --> 01:17:19,843
Leia!

1056
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:24,314
Hmm...

1057
01:17:24,419 --> 01:17:25,784
Control, control.

1058
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:27,787
You must learn control!

1059
01:17:29,791 --> 01:17:34,091
I saw... I saw a city
in the clouds.

1060
01:17:34,196 --> 01:17:35,663
Hmm...

1061
01:17:35,764 --> 01:17:38,324
Friends you have there.

1062
01:17:38,433 --> 01:17:40,424
They were in pain.

1063
01:17:40,535 --> 01:17:43,868
It is the future you see.

1064
01:17:43,972 --> 01:17:45,269
Future?

1065
01:17:53,815 --> 01:17:55,680
Will they die?

1066
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:00,281
Difficult to see.

1067
01:18:00,388 --> 01:18:03,619
Always in motion
is the future.

1068
01:18:04,726 --> 01:18:07,524
I've got to go to them.

1069
01:18:09,064 --> 01:18:11,965
Decide you must
how to serve them best.

1070
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:14,729
If you leave now,
help them you could...

1071
01:18:14,836 --> 01:18:16,804
but you would destroy all...

1072
01:18:16,905 --> 01:18:20,204
for which they have
fought and suffered.

1073
01:18:33,421 --> 01:18:36,857
No, I don't have
a landing permit.

1074
01:18:36,958 --> 01:18:40,826
I'm trying to reach
Lando Calrissian.

1075
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:43,056
Wait a minute!
Let me explain!

1076
01:18:43,164 --> 01:18:44,597
<i>You will not deviate
from your present course.</i>

1077
01:18:44,699 --> 01:18:46,223
Rather touchy,
aren't they?

1078
01:18:46,334 --> 01:18:47,995
I thought
you knew this person.

1079
01:18:48,103 --> 01:18:50,003
Gaah!

1080
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:51,936
That was
a long time ago.

1081
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,701
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

1082
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:05,913
<i>Permission granted to land
on Platform 3-2-7.</i>

1083
01:19:06,021 --> 01:19:07,488
Thank you.

1084
01:19:07,589 --> 01:19:09,489
Nothing
to worry about.

1085
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:11,218
We go way back,
Lando and me.

1086
01:19:11,326 --> 01:19:13,021
Who's worried?

1087
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:03,269
Oh. No one to meet us.

1088
01:20:03,378 --> 01:20:05,312
I don't like this.

1089
01:20:05,413 --> 01:20:07,813
Well, what
would you like?

1090
01:20:07,916 --> 01:20:10,316
<i>They did let us land.</i>

1091
01:20:10,418 --> 01:20:12,318
Look, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

1092
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:13,785
Trust me.

1093
01:20:18,426 --> 01:20:20,758
See? My friend.

1094
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:27,593
Keep your eyes
open, huh?

1095
01:20:27,702 --> 01:20:29,602
Gahhh!

1096
01:20:29,704 --> 01:20:31,171
Hey!

1097
01:20:31,272 --> 01:20:32,967
Why, you slimy...

1098
01:20:33,074 --> 01:20:36,373
double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

1099
01:20:36,478 --> 01:20:38,969
You've got a lot of guts coming here...

1100
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,707
after what you pulled.

1101
01:20:48,623 --> 01:20:51,114
Ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha!

1102
01:20:51,226 --> 01:20:54,684
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

1103
01:20:54,796 --> 01:20:57,856
Well, he seems
very friendly.

1104
01:20:57,966 --> 01:20:58,933
Yes.

1105
01:20:59,034 --> 01:21:01,059
Very friendly.

1106
01:21:01,169 --> 01:21:02,568
What are you doing here?

1107
01:21:02,671 --> 01:21:04,969
Ah, repairs.
I thought you could help me out.

1108
01:21:05,073 --> 01:21:07,098
What have you done
to my ship?

1109
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:08,106
Your ship?

1110
01:21:08,209 --> 01:21:09,176
Hey, remember...

1111
01:21:09,277 --> 01:21:11,370
you lost her to me
fair and square.

1112
01:21:11,479 --> 01:21:13,640
And how you doin',
Chewbacca?

1113
01:21:13,748 --> 01:21:14,874
Gahh!

1114
01:21:14,983 --> 01:21:16,382
You still hanging around
with this loser?

1115
01:21:16,484 --> 01:21:19,146
Gahhh!

1116
01:21:19,254 --> 01:21:21,586
Hello.
What have we here?

1117
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:22,987
Welcome,
I'm Lando Calrissian.

1118
01:21:23,091 --> 01:21:25,889
I'm the administrator
of this facility.

1119
01:21:25,994 --> 01:21:27,859
And who might you be?

1120
01:21:27,962 --> 01:21:29,088
Leia.

1121
01:21:29,197 --> 01:21:30,755
Welcome, Leia.

1122
01:21:33,902 --> 01:21:37,303
All right, all right,
you old smoothie.

1123
01:21:37,405 --> 01:21:40,806
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1124
01:21:40,909 --> 01:21:42,376
My facilities
are at your...

1125
01:21:42,477 --> 01:21:43,774
Well, really!

1126
01:21:43,878 --> 01:21:45,743
<i>What's wrong
with the Falcon?</i>

1127
01:21:45,847 --> 01:21:47,075
Hyperdrive.

1128
01:21:47,182 --> 01:21:49,082
I'll get my people
to work on her.

1129
01:21:49,184 --> 01:21:50,845
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.

1130
01:21:50,952 --> 01:21:53,853
She's the fastest
hunk of junk in the galaxy.

1131
01:21:53,955 --> 01:21:57,083
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

1132
01:21:57,192 --> 01:21:58,557
Not as well as I'd like.

1133
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:00,821
We're a small outpost
and not very self-sufficient.

1134
01:22:00,929 --> 01:22:02,328
I've had supply problems
of every kind.

1135
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:03,829
I've had labor difficulties.

1136
01:22:03,932 --> 01:22:05,559
Ha ha ha!

1137
01:22:05,667 --> 01:22:07,225
What's so funny?

1138
01:22:07,335 --> 01:22:08,825
You. Listen to you.

1139
01:22:08,937 --> 01:22:10,962
You sound like
a businessman...

1140
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,471
a responsible leader.

1141
01:22:12,574 --> 01:22:14,769
Who'd have
thought that, huh?

1142
01:22:14,876 --> 01:22:17,436
Seeing you brings back
a few things.

1143
01:22:17,545 --> 01:22:18,603
Yeah.

1144
01:22:18,713 --> 01:22:20,476
Yeah, I'm responsible
these days.

1145
01:22:20,582 --> 01:22:22,573
It's the price you pay...

1146
01:22:22,684 --> 01:22:24,584
for being successful.

1147
01:22:26,888 --> 01:22:29,356
Ooh. Nice to see
a familiar face.

1148
01:22:29,457 --> 01:22:30,856
<i>E chu ta!</i>

1149
01:22:30,959 --> 01:22:32,358
How rude!

1150
01:22:33,962 --> 01:22:35,862
That sounds like
an R2 unit in there.

1151
01:22:35,964 --> 01:22:37,431
I wonder if... Hello?

1152
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,599
How interesting.

1153
01:22:40,702 --> 01:22:42,294
Who are you?

1154
01:22:42,403 --> 01:22:43,802
Oh, my! I...
I'm terribly sorry.

1155
01:22:43,905 --> 01:22:45,395
I didn't mean
to intrude.

1156
01:22:45,507 --> 01:22:46,599
No, please don't get up.

1157
01:22:53,081 --> 01:22:54,514
Gahhh.

1158
01:23:05,059 --> 01:23:07,653
Luke, you must complete
the training.

1159
01:23:07,762 --> 01:23:09,423
I can't keep the vision
out of my head.

1160
01:23:09,531 --> 01:23:11,522
They're my friends.
I got to help them.

1161
01:23:11,633 --> 01:23:13,794
You must not go.

1162
01:23:13,902 --> 01:23:16,996
But Han and Leia will die
if I don't.

1163
01:23:17,138 --> 01:23:18,662
<i>You don't know that.</i>

1164
01:23:18,773 --> 01:23:21,640
<i>Even Yoda cannot
see their fate.</i>

1165
01:23:21,743 --> 01:23:23,870
But I can help them.

1166
01:23:23,978 --> 01:23:25,468
I feel the Force.

1167
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:27,013
<i>But you cannot
control it.</i>

1168
01:23:27,115 --> 01:23:29,640
<i>This is a dangerous
time for you...</i>

1169
01:23:29,751 --> 01:23:33,517
<i>when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.</i>

1170
01:23:33,621 --> 01:23:36,852
Yes! Yes!
To Obi-Wan you listen.

1171
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:40,018
The cave.
Remember your failure at the cave.

1172
01:23:40,128 --> 01:23:43,393
But I've learned
so much since then.

1173
01:23:43,498 --> 01:23:46,899
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and to finish what I've begun.

1174
01:23:47,001 --> 01:23:48,298
You have my word.

1175
01:23:48,403 --> 01:23:49,802
<i>It is you
and your abilities...</i>

1176
01:23:49,904 --> 01:23:51,166
<i>the emperor wants.</i>

1177
01:23:51,272 --> 01:23:55,140
<i>That is why your friends
are made to suffer.</i>

1178
01:23:55,243 --> 01:23:57,177
That's why
I have to go.

1179
01:23:57,278 --> 01:24:00,577
<i>Luke, I don't want
to lose you to the emperor...</i>

1180
01:24:00,682 --> 01:24:02,650
<i>the way I lost Vader.</i>

1181
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:04,240
You won't.

1182
01:24:04,352 --> 01:24:06,320
Stopped they must be.

1183
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:08,719
On this all depends.

1184
01:24:08,823 --> 01:24:11,155
Only a fully trained
Jedi knight...

1185
01:24:11,259 --> 01:24:13,056
with the Force
as his ally...

1186
01:24:13,161 --> 01:24:15,755
will conquer Vader
and his emperor.

1187
01:24:15,864 --> 01:24:17,991
If you end
your training now...

1188
01:24:18,099 --> 01:24:22,399
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did...

1189
01:24:22,503 --> 01:24:25,165
you will become
an agent of evil.

1190
01:24:25,273 --> 01:24:26,240
<i>Patience.</i>

1191
01:24:26,341 --> 01:24:28,536
And sacrifice
Han and Leia?

1192
01:24:28,643 --> 01:24:32,704
If you honor what they fight for... yes.

1193
01:24:32,814 --> 01:24:34,441
<i>If you choose to face Vader...</i>

1194
01:24:34,549 --> 01:24:35,914
<i>you will do it alone.</i>

1195
01:24:36,017 --> 01:24:38,042
<i>I cannot interfere.</i>

1196
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,345
I understand.

1197
01:24:45,927 --> 01:24:47,155
R2.

1198
01:24:48,763 --> 01:24:50,628
Fire up the converters.

1199
01:24:52,834 --> 01:24:53,858
<i>Luke!</i>

1200
01:24:53,968 --> 01:24:56,960
<i>Don't give in to hate.</i>

1201
01:24:57,071 --> 01:24:59,869
<i>That leads to the dark side.</i>

1202
01:24:59,974 --> 01:25:01,373
Strong is Vader.

1203
01:25:01,476 --> 01:25:04,309
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

1204
01:25:04,412 --> 01:25:05,879
I will.

1205
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,709
And I'll return.

1206
01:25:07,815 --> 01:25:09,214
I promise.

1207
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:17,924
Told you, I did.

1208
01:25:18,026 --> 01:25:19,721
Reckless is he.

1209
01:25:19,827 --> 01:25:20,885
Now...

1210
01:25:20,995 --> 01:25:22,758
matters are worse.

1211
01:25:22,864 --> 01:25:25,765
<i>That boy
is our last hope.</i>

1212
01:25:25,867 --> 01:25:27,892
No, there is another.

1213
01:25:59,701 --> 01:26:01,032
The ship's almost finished.

1214
01:26:01,135 --> 01:26:03,365
Two or three more things
and we're in great shape.

1215
01:26:03,471 --> 01:26:05,063
The sooner the better.
Something is wrong here.

1216
01:26:05,173 --> 01:26:07,698
No one has seen or knows
anything about 3PO.

1217
01:26:07,809 --> 01:26:10,073
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

1218
01:26:10,178 --> 01:26:12,578
Relax.
I'll talk to Lando...

1219
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:15,080
and see what
I can find out.

1220
01:26:15,183 --> 01:26:17,083
I don't trust Lando.

1221
01:26:17,185 --> 01:26:19,585
Well, I don't
trust him either.

1222
01:26:19,687 --> 01:26:22,178
But he is my friend.
Besides...

1223
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:24,190
we'll soon be gone.

1224
01:26:24,292 --> 01:26:27,591
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

1225
01:27:00,862 --> 01:27:02,295
Gaahh!

1226
01:27:02,397 --> 01:27:03,455
What happened?

1227
01:27:03,564 --> 01:27:05,054
Gahhh gahhh.

1228
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:06,497
Where?

1229
01:27:06,601 --> 01:27:07,898
Gahhh!

1230
01:27:08,002 --> 01:27:09,867
Found him
in a junk pile?

1231
01:27:09,971 --> 01:27:12,701
Oh, what a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

1232
01:27:12,807 --> 01:27:14,741
Gahhh!

1233
01:27:14,842 --> 01:27:16,503
Lando's got people
that can fix him.

1234
01:27:16,611 --> 01:27:18,078
No, thanks.

1235
01:27:18,179 --> 01:27:21,808
I'm sorry, am I
interrupting anything?

1236
01:27:21,916 --> 01:27:23,884
Not really.

1237
01:27:27,355 --> 01:27:29,414
You look
absolutely beautiful.

1238
01:27:29,524 --> 01:27:32,857
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

1239
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,393
Thank you.

1240
01:27:34,495 --> 01:27:37,396
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?

1241
01:27:37,498 --> 01:27:39,056
Everyone's invited,
of course.

1242
01:27:40,501 --> 01:27:42,366
Having trouble
with your droid?

1243
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:43,903
No, no problem.

1244
01:27:44,005 --> 01:27:44,994
Why?

1245
01:27:53,214 --> 01:27:55,512
You see, since we're
a small operation...

1246
01:27:55,616 --> 01:27:57,607
we don't fall into...

1247
01:27:57,718 --> 01:28:00,050
the jurisdiction
of the Empire.

1248
01:28:00,154 --> 01:28:03,055
So you're part of
the Mining Guild, then?

1249
01:28:03,157 --> 01:28:05,022
No, not actually. Our operation
is small enough not to be noticed.

1250
01:28:05,126 --> 01:28:07,060
Which is advantageous
for everybody...

1251
01:28:07,161 --> 01:28:09,527
since our customers
are anxious to avoid...

1252
01:28:09,630 --> 01:28:11,757
attracting attention
to themselves.

1253
01:28:11,866 --> 01:28:14,300
Aren't you afraid
the Empire's going to find out...

1254
01:28:14,402 --> 01:28:16,233
about this little operation,
shut you down?

1255
01:28:16,337 --> 01:28:18,737
It's always been a danger that looms
like a shadow over everything we've built.

1256
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,206
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

1257
01:28:21,309 --> 01:28:26,144
I've just made a deal that will
keep the Empire out of here forever.

1258
01:28:35,156 --> 01:28:37,954
We would be honored
if you would join us.

1259
01:28:43,431 --> 01:28:44,830
I had no choice.

1260
01:28:44,932 --> 01:28:47,230
They arrived
right before you did.

1261
01:28:47,335 --> 01:28:48,802
I'm sorry.

1262
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,667
I'm sorry, too.

1263
01:28:56,944 --> 01:28:58,741
Gahhh.

1264
01:29:10,191 --> 01:29:12,182
No, 3PO's with them.

1265
01:29:12,293 --> 01:29:14,420
Just hang on.
We're almost there.

1266
01:29:22,203 --> 01:29:24,603
Gahhh!

1267
01:29:24,705 --> 01:29:28,141
Gahhh!

1268
01:30:11,219 --> 01:30:13,084
Oh ah ooh ah.

1269
01:30:13,187 --> 01:30:15,587
Im trbly srry.

1270
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:18,090
I dndt mn to
intrddd.

1271
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:24,596
No! Secret.
Stormtroopers?

1272
01:30:24,699 --> 01:30:26,257
Here?
We're in danger!

1273
01:30:26,367 --> 01:30:28,358
I must
tell the others.

1274
01:30:28,469 --> 01:30:30,437
Oh, no,
I've been shot!

1275
01:30:49,257 --> 01:30:50,918
Aaah!

1276
01:30:51,025 --> 01:30:52,083
Aaah!

1277
01:30:52,193 --> 01:30:56,152
Aaaaahhh!

1278
01:30:57,698 --> 01:30:59,097
Lord Vader.

1279
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,601
You may take Captain Solo
to Jabba the Hutt...

1280
01:31:02,703 --> 01:31:04,568
after I have Skywalker.

1281
01:31:04,672 --> 01:31:06,537
He's no good to me dead.

1282
01:31:06,641 --> 01:31:09,576
He will not be
permanently damaged.

1283
01:31:09,677 --> 01:31:11,770
Aaaahhh!

1284
01:31:11,879 --> 01:31:15,280
Lord Vader, what about Leia
and the Wookiee?

1285
01:31:15,383 --> 01:31:17,749
They must never again
leave this city.

1286
01:31:17,852 --> 01:31:19,376
That was never a condition
of our agreement...

1287
01:31:19,487 --> 01:31:21,079
nor was giving Han
to this bounty hunter.

1288
01:31:21,188 --> 01:31:26,353
Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?

1289
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:27,358
No.

1290
01:31:27,461 --> 01:31:28,894
Good. It would be
unfortunate...

1291
01:31:28,996 --> 01:31:32,557
if I had to leave
a garrison here.

1292
01:31:32,667 --> 01:31:37,001
This deal is getting worse all the time.

1293
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:41,140
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.

1294
01:31:41,242 --> 01:31:42,402
Oh!

1295
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:45,104
Something's not right
because now I can't see.

1296
01:31:45,212 --> 01:31:49,308
Oh, oh, oh,
that's much better.

1297
01:31:49,417 --> 01:31:50,816
Wait! Wait!

1298
01:31:50,918 --> 01:31:52,818
Oh, my!
What have you done?

1299
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,820
I'm backwards...

1300
01:31:54,922 --> 01:31:56,822
you flea-bitten
furball!

1301
01:31:56,924 --> 01:31:58,824
Only an overgrown
mophead like you...

1302
01:31:58,926 --> 01:32:00,553
would be
stupid enough...

1303
01:32:14,108 --> 01:32:15,666
I feel terrible.

1304
01:32:15,776 --> 01:32:17,175
Gahhh.

1305
01:32:30,825 --> 01:32:33,191
Why are they
doing this?

1306
01:32:36,330 --> 01:32:39,697
They never even asked me
any questions.

1307
01:32:43,137 --> 01:32:44,695
Lando.

1308
01:32:47,475 --> 01:32:48,499
Grrr!

1309
01:32:48,609 --> 01:32:49,735
Get out of here, Lando.

1310
01:32:49,844 --> 01:32:51,709
Shut up and listen!

1311
01:32:51,812 --> 01:32:54,007
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

1312
01:32:54,115 --> 01:32:56,015
They'll have to stay here,
but at least they'll be safe.

1313
01:32:56,117 --> 01:32:57,175
What about Han?

1314
01:32:57,284 --> 01:32:58,251
Vader's given him
to the bounty hunter.

1315
01:32:58,352 --> 01:32:59,876
Vader wants us
all dead.

1316
01:32:59,987 --> 01:33:01,011
He doesn't want you at all.

1317
01:33:01,122 --> 01:33:02,885
He's after somebody
called Skywalker.

1318
01:33:02,990 --> 01:33:04,890
- Luke.
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.

1319
01:33:04,992 --> 01:33:06,983
And we're the bait!

1320
01:33:07,094 --> 01:33:08,925
He's on his way.

1321
01:33:09,029 --> 01:33:12,089
You fixed us all
real good, didn't you?

1322
01:33:12,199 --> 01:33:13,393
My friend.

1323
01:33:15,703 --> 01:33:16,829
Stop!

1324
01:33:18,873 --> 01:33:20,397
I've done all I can.

1325
01:33:20,508 --> 01:33:21,907
I'm sorry
I couldn't do better...

1326
01:33:22,009 --> 01:33:23,601
but I've got
my own problems.

1327
01:33:23,711 --> 01:33:25,076
Yeah.

1328
01:33:25,179 --> 01:33:27,010
You're a real hero.

1329
01:33:37,391 --> 01:33:39,951
You certainly have
a way with people.

1330
01:33:43,731 --> 01:33:45,323
Ah... Ah...

1331
01:33:54,341 --> 01:33:56,468
This facility is crude...

1332
01:33:56,577 --> 01:33:59,512
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker...

1333
01:33:59,613 --> 01:34:02,013
for his journey to the emperor.

1334
01:34:02,116 --> 01:34:04,949
Lord Vader, ship approaching,
X-wing class.

1335
01:34:05,052 --> 01:34:07,350
Good.
Monitor Skywalker...

1336
01:34:07,455 --> 01:34:09,446
and allow him
to land.

1337
01:34:09,557 --> 01:34:12,924
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing.

1338
01:34:13,027 --> 01:34:15,359
You put him in there,
it might kill him.

1339
01:34:15,463 --> 01:34:16,862
I do not want...

1340
01:34:16,964 --> 01:34:18,363
the emperor's prize
damaged.

1341
01:34:18,466 --> 01:34:20,934
We will test it
on Captain Solo.

1342
01:34:43,524 --> 01:34:46,322
If only you'd
attached my legs...

1343
01:34:46,427 --> 01:34:48,361
I wouldn't be
in this ridiculous position.

1344
01:34:48,462 --> 01:34:49,861
Now remember,
Chewbacca...

1345
01:34:49,964 --> 01:34:51,864
you have a responsibility for me...

1346
01:34:51,966 --> 01:34:53,797
so don't do anything foolish.

1347
01:35:06,580 --> 01:35:08,343
What's going on...

1348
01:35:08,449 --> 01:35:09,939
buddy?

1349
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:12,985
You're being put
into carbon freeze.

1350
01:35:13,087 --> 01:35:16,545
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

1351
01:35:16,657 --> 01:35:18,056
The Empire
will compensate you...

1352
01:35:18,158 --> 01:35:19,216
if he dies.

1353
01:35:19,326 --> 01:35:21,226
Put him in.

1354
01:35:21,328 --> 01:35:22,386
Rrrah!

1355
01:35:22,496 --> 01:35:24,896
Rrrah! Rrrah!

1356
01:35:24,999 --> 01:35:26,899
Stop, Chewie,
stop, stop!

1357
01:35:27,001 --> 01:35:30,493
Yes, stop, please!
I'm not ready to die!

1358
01:35:30,604 --> 01:35:33,072
Hey! Hey! Listen
to me, Chewie.

1359
01:35:33,173 --> 01:35:35,198
This won't help me.

1360
01:35:35,309 --> 01:35:36,537
Hey, save your strength.

1361
01:35:36,644 --> 01:35:39,238
There will be
another time.

1362
01:35:39,346 --> 01:35:41,405
The princess...

1363
01:35:41,515 --> 01:35:43,312
You have to
take care of her.

1364
01:35:45,519 --> 01:35:47,817
Do you hear me?
Huh?

1365
01:35:47,922 --> 01:35:49,184
Gahhh...

1366
01:36:01,435 --> 01:36:02,595
I love you.

1367
01:36:02,703 --> 01:36:04,398
I know.

1368
01:36:25,459 --> 01:36:26,892
Gahhh!

1369
01:36:33,567 --> 01:36:35,694
What's going on?
Turn around!

1370
01:36:35,803 --> 01:36:37,202
Chewbacca,
I can't see.

1371
01:36:51,418 --> 01:36:53,613
Gahhh.

1372
01:37:34,962 --> 01:37:38,363
Oh, they've encased him
in carbonite.

1373
01:37:38,465 --> 01:37:40,126
He should be quite
well-protected...

1374
01:37:40,234 --> 01:37:42,168
if he survived the freezing process,
that is.

1375
01:37:42,269 --> 01:37:45,136
Well, Calrissian,
did he survive?

1376
01:37:45,239 --> 01:37:47,070
Yes, he's alive.

1377
01:37:47,174 --> 01:37:49,301
And in perfect hibernation.

1378
01:37:49,410 --> 01:37:52,379
He's all yours,
bounty hunter.

1379
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:54,970
Reset the chamber
for Skywalker.

1380
01:37:57,384 --> 01:37:59,215
Skywalker has
just landed, lord.

1381
01:37:59,319 --> 01:38:03,221
Good. See to it
that he finds his way in here.

1382
01:38:07,461 --> 01:38:11,898
Calrissian, take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

1383
01:38:11,999 --> 01:38:14,160
You said they'd be left in the city
under my supervision.

1384
01:38:14,268 --> 01:38:16,327
I am altering the deal.

1385
01:38:16,437 --> 01:38:19,167
Pray I don't
alter it any further.

1386
01:39:55,068 --> 01:39:56,296
Gahhh!

1387
01:39:56,403 --> 01:39:58,963
Luke! Luke, don't,
it's a trap!

1388
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:01,566
It's a trap!

1389
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:50,347
The Force is with you,
young Skywalker.

1390
01:40:51,859 --> 01:40:54,828
But you are not
a Jedi yet.

1391
01:41:56,156 --> 01:41:57,555
Well done.

1392
01:41:59,693 --> 01:42:02,093
Hold them
in the security tower.

1393
01:42:02,195 --> 01:42:04,322
And keep it quiet. Move.

1394
01:42:09,303 --> 01:42:11,533
What do you think
you're doing?

1395
01:42:11,638 --> 01:42:12,605
We're getting
out of here.

1396
01:42:12,739 --> 01:42:14,468
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.

1397
01:42:14,574 --> 01:42:17,441
Do you think that after what you did
to Han, we're going to trust you?

1398
01:42:17,544 --> 01:42:18,306
Grrr!

1399
01:42:18,412 --> 01:42:20,073
I had no choice.

1400
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:21,738
What are you doing?
Trust him! Trust him!

1401
01:42:21,848 --> 01:42:24,874
We understand, don't we,
Chewie? He had no choice.

1402
01:42:24,985 --> 01:42:26,543
I'm just
trying to help.

1403
01:42:26,653 --> 01:42:28,951
We don't need
any of your help.

1404
01:42:29,056 --> 01:42:30,421
Haaa...

1405
01:42:30,524 --> 01:42:31,286
Grrr!

1406
01:42:31,391 --> 01:42:33,621
Ha... Ha...

1407
01:42:33,727 --> 01:42:34,751
What?

1408
01:42:34,861 --> 01:42:35,919
Han...

1409
01:42:36,029 --> 01:42:37,155
It sounds like Han.

1410
01:42:37,264 --> 01:42:38,788
There's still
a chance...

1411
01:42:38,899 --> 01:42:40,628
to save Han...

1412
01:42:40,734 --> 01:42:43,066
at the east...

1413
01:42:43,170 --> 01:42:44,831
platform.

1414
01:42:44,938 --> 01:42:45,927
Chewie.

1415
01:42:48,575 --> 01:42:51,169
I'm terribly sorry
about all this.

1416
01:42:51,278 --> 01:42:53,075
After all,
he's only a Wookiee.

1417
01:42:53,180 --> 01:42:56,775
Put Captain Solo
in the cargo hold.

1418
01:43:11,898 --> 01:43:14,298
R2, R2, where have you been?

1419
01:43:14,401 --> 01:43:16,164
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...

1420
01:43:16,269 --> 01:43:20,137
Hurry! Hurry! We're trying to save Han
from the bounty hunter.

1421
01:43:21,641 --> 01:43:25,270
Well, at least you're still in one piece.

1422
01:43:25,379 --> 01:43:27,779
Look what's happened to me.

1423
01:43:39,726 --> 01:43:42,320
Oh, no! Chewie,
they're behind you!

1424
01:43:55,275 --> 01:43:57,641
You have learned
much, young one.

1425
01:43:57,744 --> 01:43:59,871
You'll find
I'm full of surprises.

1426
01:44:10,924 --> 01:44:14,553
Your destiny lies
with me, Skywalker.

1427
01:44:14,661 --> 01:44:17,960
Obi-Wan knew this
to be true.

1428
01:44:18,065 --> 01:44:18,861
No.

1429
01:44:23,303 --> 01:44:24,167
Aaah!

1430
01:44:25,972 --> 01:44:27,337
All too easy.

1431
01:44:32,612 --> 01:44:35,046
Perhaps you're
not as strong...

1432
01:44:35,148 --> 01:44:37,013
as the emperor thought.

1433
01:44:38,185 --> 01:44:39,846
Impressive.

1434
01:44:41,788 --> 01:44:43,221
Most impressive.

1435
01:44:46,126 --> 01:44:47,684
Aaah!

1436
01:44:50,697 --> 01:44:52,665
Obi-Wan has
taught you well.

1437
01:44:52,766 --> 01:44:55,132
You have
controlled your fear.

1438
01:44:56,636 --> 01:44:58,103
Now...

1439
01:44:58,205 --> 01:45:00,765
release your anger.

1440
01:45:00,874 --> 01:45:03,934
Only your hatred
can destroy me.

1441
01:45:14,488 --> 01:45:15,750
Ohh!

1442
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:16,370
The security code
has been changed.

1443
01:47:16,476 --> 01:47:18,376
R2, you can tell
the computer...

1444
01:47:18,478 --> 01:47:19,775
to override
the security systems.

1445
01:47:19,879 --> 01:47:22,279
R2, hurry!

1446
01:47:24,751 --> 01:47:26,810
Attention. This is
Lando Calrissian.

1447
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:29,354
Attention. The Empire has taken
control of the city.

1448
01:47:29,456 --> 01:47:31,271
I advise everyone to leave
before more imperial troops arrive.

1449
01:47:31,306 --> 01:47:33,086
I advise everyone to leave
before more imperial troops arrive.

1450
01:47:39,566 --> 01:47:40,828
This way.

1451
01:47:40,934 --> 01:47:43,334
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.

1452
01:47:43,436 --> 01:47:47,566
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

1453
01:48:07,527 --> 01:48:08,960
Ah! We're not interested...

1454
01:48:09,062 --> 01:48:11,087
<i>in the Millennium
Falcon's hyperdrive.</i>

1455
01:48:11,197 --> 01:48:12,926
It's fixed!

1456
01:48:14,768 --> 01:48:17,566
Just open the door,
you stupid lump!

1457
01:48:26,313 --> 01:48:28,804
I never doubted you
for a second.

1458
01:48:28,915 --> 01:48:29,904
Wonderful!

1459
01:48:52,772 --> 01:48:54,831
Ouch! Oh! That hurts!

1460
01:48:54,941 --> 01:48:57,136
Bend down,
you thoughtless... Ow!

1461
01:49:01,648 --> 01:49:03,479
Leia!

1462
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:05,649
Go!

1463
01:49:10,423 --> 01:49:14,325
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.

1464
01:49:15,428 --> 01:49:16,861
Of course
I've looked better.

1465
01:50:10,517 --> 01:50:12,007
You are beaten.

1466
01:50:12,118 --> 01:50:14,211
It is useless to resist.

1467
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:16,254
Don't let yourself
be destroyed...

1468
01:50:16,356 --> 01:50:17,846
as Obi-Wan did.

1469
01:50:23,563 --> 01:50:25,428
Uh!

1470
01:50:28,535 --> 01:50:30,765
Aah!

1471
01:50:32,472 --> 01:50:35,270
There is no escape.

1472
01:50:35,375 --> 01:50:38,276
Don't make me destroy you.

1473
01:50:40,313 --> 01:50:41,302
Luke...

1474
01:50:41,414 --> 01:50:44,815
you do not yet realize
your importance.

1475
01:50:44,918 --> 01:50:47,819
You have only begun
to discover your power.

1476
01:50:47,921 --> 01:50:49,479
Join me...

1477
01:50:49,589 --> 01:50:52,285
and I will complete
your training.

1478
01:50:52,392 --> 01:50:54,656
With our combined strength...

1479
01:50:54,761 --> 01:50:57,662
we can end
this destructive conflict...

1480
01:50:57,764 --> 01:51:00,324
and bring order
to the galaxy.

1481
01:51:00,433 --> 01:51:01,900
I'll never join you!

1482
01:51:02,001 --> 01:51:04,799
If you only knew
the power...

1483
01:51:04,904 --> 01:51:06,838
of the dark side.

1484
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:09,170
Obi-Wan never told you...

1485
01:51:09,275 --> 01:51:11,175
what happened
to your father.

1486
01:51:11,277 --> 01:51:12,972
He told me enough.

1487
01:51:15,582 --> 01:51:17,447
He told me
you killed him.

1488
01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:18,847
No.

1489
01:51:18,952 --> 01:51:21,318
<i>I am your father.</i>

1490
01:51:25,458 --> 01:51:27,517
No.

1491
01:51:27,627 --> 01:51:29,117
No.

1492
01:51:29,229 --> 01:51:32,460
That's not true.

1493
01:51:32,565 --> 01:51:34,294
That's impossible!

1494
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:37,665
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1495
01:51:38,905 --> 01:51:41,533
No!

1496
01:51:41,641 --> 01:51:44,940
No!

1497
01:51:45,044 --> 01:51:46,375
Luke.

1498
01:51:46,479 --> 01:51:48,640
You can destroy
the emperor.

1499
01:51:48,748 --> 01:51:50,648
He has foreseen this.

1500
01:51:50,750 --> 01:51:53,548
It is your destiny.

1501
01:51:53,653 --> 01:51:58,147
Join me, and together
we can rule the galaxy...

1502
01:51:58,258 --> 01:51:59,885
as father and son.

1503
01:52:10,503 --> 01:52:12,164
Come with me.

1504
01:52:12,272 --> 01:52:15,207
It is the only way.

1505
01:53:21,107 --> 01:53:23,337
Ben.

1506
01:53:23,443 --> 01:53:25,570
Ben, please.

1507
01:53:34,554 --> 01:53:36,021
Ben.

1508
01:53:41,227 --> 01:53:42,558
Leia.

1509
01:53:52,705 --> 01:53:54,673
Hear me.

1510
01:53:56,309 --> 01:53:57,606
Leia.

1511
01:53:57,710 --> 01:53:59,200
Luke.

1512
01:54:01,381 --> 01:54:03,281
We've got to go back.

1513
01:54:03,383 --> 01:54:05,317
- What?
- I know where Luke is.

1514
01:54:05,418 --> 01:54:06,578
What about
those fighters?

1515
01:54:06,686 --> 01:54:08,745
Chewie, just do it.

1516
01:54:08,855 --> 01:54:10,288
But what about Vader?

1517
01:54:10,390 --> 01:54:11,789
All right, all right!

1518
01:54:19,432 --> 01:54:24,028
Alert my Stardestroyer
to prepare for my arrival.

1519
01:54:33,379 --> 01:54:36,246
Look, someone's up there.

1520
01:54:37,717 --> 01:54:38,809
It's Luke.

1521
01:54:38,918 --> 01:54:40,408
Chewie, slow down.

1522
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:42,420
Slow down.
We'll get under him.

1523
01:54:42,522 --> 01:54:44,820
Lando,
open the top hatch.

1524
01:54:59,672 --> 01:55:00,832
O.K.

1525
01:55:00,940 --> 01:55:02,032
Easy, Chewie.

1526
01:55:02,141 --> 01:55:03,199
Gahrrr.

1527
01:55:23,796 --> 01:55:24,728
Lando?

1528
01:55:24,831 --> 01:55:25,923
<i>O.K., let's go.</i>

1529
01:55:43,182 --> 01:55:45,377
Oh, Leia.

1530
01:55:45,485 --> 01:55:47,419
All right, Chewie,
let's go.

1531
01:56:22,655 --> 01:56:23,917
I'll be back.

1532
01:56:30,563 --> 01:56:31,962
Stardestroyer.

1533
01:56:37,203 --> 01:56:39,569
All right, Chewie.
Ready for light speed.

1534
01:56:39,672 --> 01:56:41,833
<i>If your people fixed
the hyperdrive.</i>

1535
01:56:41,941 --> 01:56:44,307
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

1536
01:56:44,410 --> 01:56:46,571
Punch it!

1537
01:56:56,556 --> 01:56:58,854
They told me
they fixed it.

1538
01:56:58,958 --> 01:57:00,858
I trusted them!

1539
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:03,485
It's not my fault!

1540
01:57:08,534 --> 01:57:11,594
They'll be in range
of our tractor beam in moments, lord.

1541
01:57:11,704 --> 01:57:13,262
Did your men deactivate...

1542
01:57:13,372 --> 01:57:15,431
<i>the hyperdrive on
the Millennium Falcon?</i>

1543
01:57:15,541 --> 01:57:16,473
Yes, my lord.

1544
01:57:16,576 --> 01:57:18,942
Good. Prepare
the boarding party...

1545
01:57:19,045 --> 01:57:21,309
and set your weapons
for "stun."

1546
01:57:21,414 --> 01:57:23,279
Yes, my lord.
Lieutenant.

1547
01:57:23,382 --> 01:57:24,440
Yes, sir.

1548
01:57:26,085 --> 01:57:28,883
Noisy brute. Why don't we just
go into light speed?

1549
01:57:30,489 --> 01:57:32,354
We can't?
How would you know...

1550
01:57:32,458 --> 01:57:33,516
the hyperdrive
is deactivated?

1551
01:57:36,796 --> 01:57:39,196
The city's central
computer told you?

1552
01:57:39,298 --> 01:57:42,563
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.

1553
01:57:42,668 --> 01:57:43,692
Ouch!

1554
01:57:43,803 --> 01:57:45,998
Pay attention
to what you're doing!

1555
01:57:56,415 --> 01:57:58,076
Luke.

1556
01:57:58,184 --> 01:58:00,414
Father.

1557
01:58:00,519 --> 01:58:04,319
Son, come with me.

1558
01:58:06,192 --> 01:58:07,659
Ben.

1559
01:58:08,995 --> 01:58:10,963
Why didn't you tell me?

1560
01:58:16,202 --> 01:58:18,102
Chewie!

1561
01:58:29,282 --> 01:58:30,544
It's Vader.

1562
01:58:36,222 --> 01:58:39,817
Luke, it is your destiny.

1563
01:58:44,664 --> 01:58:46,928
Ben.

1564
01:58:47,033 --> 01:58:49,467
Why didn't you tell me?

1565
01:58:56,208 --> 01:58:58,039
Alert all commands.

1566
01:58:58,144 --> 01:59:00,135
Ready for
the tractor beam.

1567
01:59:02,515 --> 01:59:04,415
R2, come back at once!

1568
01:59:04,517 --> 01:59:06,382
You haven't finished
with me yet.

1569
01:59:06,485 --> 01:59:08,248
You don't know how
to fix the hyperdrive.

1570
01:59:08,354 --> 01:59:09,753
Chewbacca can do it.

1571
01:59:09,855 --> 01:59:11,254
I'm standing here
in pieces...

1572
01:59:11,357 --> 01:59:14,554
and you're having
delusions of grandeur!

1573
01:59:17,029 --> 01:59:19,156
You did it!

1574
02:00:16,055 --> 02:00:18,615
Luke, we're ready
for takeoff.

1575
02:00:18,724 --> 02:00:19,884
<i>Good luck, Lando.</i>

1576
02:00:20,026 --> 02:00:22,119
<i>When we find
Jabba the Hutt...</i>

1577
02:00:22,228 --> 02:00:23,627
<i>and that
bounty hunter...</i>

1578
02:00:23,729 --> 02:00:24,889
<i>we'll contact you.</i>

1579
02:00:24,997 --> 02:00:27,659
I'll meet you
at the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1580
02:00:27,767 --> 02:00:29,860
Princess,
we'll find Han.

1581
02:00:29,969 --> 02:00:31,197
I promise.

1582
02:00:31,303 --> 02:00:33,533
Chewie, I'll be waiting
for your signal.

1583
02:00:33,639 --> 02:00:35,368
Take care, you two.

1584
02:00:35,474 --> 02:00:37,339
<i>May the Force
be with you.</i>

1585
02:00:37,443 --> 02:00:38,967
Gahhh.

1586
02:00:39,078 --> 02:00:41,546
<i>Gahhh.</i>

1587
02:00:50,656 --> 02:00:51,623
Ow.
