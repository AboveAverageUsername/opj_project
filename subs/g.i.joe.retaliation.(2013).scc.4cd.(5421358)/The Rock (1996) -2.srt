1
00:00:00,488 --> 00:00:03,090
- They're hearing sounds above, sir.
- Stand fast.

2
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:05,889
Down, down, down.

3
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:13,411
West storm drain's clear.

4
00:00:17,571 --> 00:00:21,170
Ninety-seven paces
to the shower room.

5
00:00:25,249 --> 00:00:28,370
The Eagles are now at the access
tunnel. They're right under
the shower room, sir.

6
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:37,889
Fiber optics.

7
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:43,889
- Something's not right.
- I got a bad feeling about this.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,074
Подржите нас и постаните VIP члан да бисте уклонили све огласе са www.OpenSubtitles.org

9
00:01:02,648 --> 00:01:04,528
Quiet.

10
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,767
Motion sensors.

11
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,728
- Beams cutting across
the manhole covers.
- Deal with it.

12
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,648
Commander, the beam is hitting
some sort of reflective device.

13
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:31,412
Possibly a prism.

14
00:01:33,648 --> 00:01:36,728
I want to use a mirror
to cut the beam...

15
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:40,969
send the beam back to its source,
and then I'm gonna move the prism.

16
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,611
We've got motion on a trembler
in the shower room, sir.

17
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,768
We've got visitors.
Let's move.

18
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:56,090
Got it.
Good to go.

19
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:00,209
- Fuck, man! I knew this
would happen! Fuck!
- Move!

20
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,411
Stand fast.
We'll secure the area.

21
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:16,209
They're entering
into the shower room, sir.

22
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,171
They're securing the area.

23
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:31,929
Just sit tight.

24
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,250
Drop your weapons!
Drop 'em!

25
00:02:37,332 --> 00:02:39,447
- Stand fast!
- Hold your fire!

26
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,488
- Drop your weapons!
- Hold your fire!

27
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:47,809
It's a fucking trap.

28
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:49,529
This is General Hummel.

29
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:53,171
Drop your weapons. Drop 'em!

30
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:56,131
Anderson here,
General Hummel.

31
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,690
Commander. Team leader.

32
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:01,649
Commander Anderson, if you have
any concern for the lives of your men...

33
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,649
you will order them to safety their
weapons and place them on the deck.

34
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,529
This is not happening.

35
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:09,930
Sir, we know why
you're out here.

36
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:12,250
God knows I agree with you.

37
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,447
But like you, I swore to defend
this country against all enemies...

38
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:20,411
foreign, sir, and domestic.

39
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:23,850
General, we've spilled
the same blood in the same mud.

40
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,769
You know goddamn well
I can't give that order.

41
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:28,250
We're dead.

42
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:31,730
Your unit is covered
from an elevated position, Commander.

43
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:35,411
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Don't do anything stupid.

44
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:37,809
No one has to die here.

45
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:42,171
Men following the general, you're
under oath as United States Marines!

46
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,131
Have you forgotten that?

47
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,250
We all have shipmates
we remember.

48
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:50,611
Some of them were shit on
and pissed on by the Pentagon.

49
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:54,571
- But that doesn't give you
the right to mutiny!
- You call it what you want!

50
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:58,528
You're down there, we're up here.
You walked into the wrong
goddamn room, Commander!

51
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,489
- Stand fast!
- Goddamn it, Commander, one last time.

52
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:02,648
You tell your men to safety
their weapons, drop 'em on the deck.

53
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:05,170
- I cannot give that order!
- I am not gonna repeat that order!

54
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:08,008
- I will not give that order!
- What the hell is wrong with you, man?

55
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,770
- Stand fast!
- Oh, my God!

56
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:14,170
- Let's waste these fuckers.
- One last time. You order your
men to safety their weapons--

57
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:23,331
Cease fire!

58
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,131
Don't go.

59
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:47,809
Cease fire!

60
00:04:56,331 --> 00:04:58,170
Cease fire!

61
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:00,331
Shit! Goddamn it!

62
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:02,689
Let go of me.
Let go of me!

63
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,770
Don't. Don't go.

64
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:53,770
It's over.

65
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,131
Oh, God!

66
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:25,371
Later.

67
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:37,730
- We got some movement.
- Who?
- Two of 'em!

68
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,448
- Who is it?
- Eagles 11 and 12.

69
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:42,131
- I-lt's Goodspeed and Mason.
- I knew it.

70
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,850
I've gotta get a team together
right now. We've gotta move
with the second option.

71
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,090
What, and invite
another massacre? No way.

72
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:51,730
We've got a 60-year-old convict and
a lab rat. I'm telling you, it's over.

73
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:53,890
Not for Mason, it isn't.

74
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:08,770
Goodspeed, I'm not gonna kill you.

75
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,890
- Where are you going?
- Off this bloody island.

76
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,528
What? Wh-Wh-What for?

77
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,170
Goodspeed.
Goodspeed, do you read me?

78
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,090
It's for you.

79
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,528
- Sir?
- What's the status?

80
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,290
The status is they're dead.
They're dead!

81
00:07:28,331 --> 00:07:30,331
It's just me and Mason.
Now he says he's leaving.

82
00:07:30,412 --> 00:07:34,528
That is unacceptable.
Do you hear me? Unacceptable!

83
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,170
Well, there's a problem, sir.
He's got a gun.

84
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,210
What do you have,
a fuckin' water pistol?

85
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:42,890
- No, sir.
- Go after him and stop him.

86
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,050
I didn't want this.

87
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:49,689
- Jesus, I didn't want this.
- You knew this might happen, Frank.

88
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,770
- Well, maybe now they'll pay up.
- Maybe now they won't, Captain.

89
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:55,249
Then maybe we need to execute
a few hostages.

90
00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:58,448
- Got a live one!
- Put a bullet in him.

91
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:02,008
- You heard him. End it!
- Holster that sidearm, Captain.

92
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:21,488
Sir?

93
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:27,170
You made a terrible mistake.

94
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,410
And more of our brothers
have died in vain.

95
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:33,488
Damn you for forcing me
into this position.

96
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:39,250
I need to talk to you
right now, alone.

97
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:41,729
Now you told me
I'm on a need-to-know basis.

98
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:46,849
And I'm tellin' you right now,
I need to know who the fuck
John Mason is right now, sir.

99
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,890
All right, you wanna know?
1962, J. Edgar Hoover...

100
00:08:50,971 --> 00:08:53,649
is head of the FBl,
some say the country.

101
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:57,529
It's no secret he kept microfilm files
on prominent Americans and Europeans:

102
00:08:57,611 --> 00:09:01,050
de Gaulle, British members
of Parliament, even the prime minister.

103
00:09:01,131 --> 00:09:04,131
I mean, this guy had dirt
on everybody in the world.

104
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:07,649
Yeah, I know all the cloak-and-dagger
stories. Where does Mason fit in?

105
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:10,371
Mason was the British operative
who stole the files.

106
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:13,131
But our Bureau agents caught him
at the Canadian border.

107
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,448
Of course, the British claimed
they'd never heard of him.

108
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:18,410
And we held him
without trial...

109
00:09:18,448 --> 00:09:22,689
until he gave up the microfilm,
but he never did.

110
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,410
Well, I'm surprised Hoover
didn't use his daughter as leverage.

111
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:28,649
Hoover was dead in '72.
She wasn't born yet.

112
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:32,170
Today, well, it's
a different Bureau.

113
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,371
So you held this guy without trial
his whole life! No wonder he's pissed.

114
00:09:36,448 --> 00:09:40,729
This man knows our most intimate secrets
from the last half century:

115
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:44,890
the alien landing at Roswell, the truth
about the J.F.K. assassination.

116
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,570
And Mason's angry, he's lethal,
he's a trained killer.

117
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,009
And he is the only hope
that we have got.

118
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:56,930
Mason! Mason!

119
00:09:58,971 --> 00:10:01,332
There are 81 hostages
still up there.

120
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,170
Yeah, like me.

121
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,770
All right, you wanna play tough?
You wanna play tough with me?

122
00:10:05,849 --> 00:10:08,570
Okay. FBl!
Freeze, sucker!

123
00:10:10,488 --> 00:10:14,611
- I'll fire.
- No, you won't.

124
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:18,170
- Throw down.
- You're not the sort.

125
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,930
Let's find out.

126
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:26,971
I could; you, no.

127
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,448
Besides, your safety's on.

128
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,971
Goodspeed, have you
resolved the situation?

129
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,849
Not yet.

130
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,209
-He's got all the guns now, sir.
-Shit!

131
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,689
You're right, I don't use guns
and I don't kick down doors.

132
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,448
- This is what I do.
- I haven't got my glasses.

133
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:50,689
What it says
is Chemical Weapons Specialist.

134
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:54,529
That's right.
I got a lunatic up there, man...

135
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:58,009
with 15 missiles armed
with some really funky stuff.

136
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:02,729
That lying Womack.
You could've told my daughter.

137
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:07,131
It was classified.
Look, I'm in the same situation.

138
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,332
They've got my girlfriend in
the city with a baby on the way.

139
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,371
Look, I can defuse the rockets.
I really can.

140
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:16,410
But I'm gonna need your help,
and I'm gonna need it right now.

141
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,131
Sir, this man's weapons
and tack radio are missing!

142
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:30,729
Shit, we got a rodent problem.
Flush the pipes.

143
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:33,529
There's probably a maze of
tunnels on this goddamn island.
Check every access you can find.

144
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:35,649
Sir.

145
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:43,689
Even if you escape
from the island...

146
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,890
you can't escape
the rockets.

147
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:50,488
So, where are you gonna go? Go where?
What are, what are you gonna do?

148
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,371
- Show me where the morgue is, Mason.
- I'm out of here.

149
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:03,209
What about your daughter? Mason?

150
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,729
Rodents located.

151
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:11,930
The way I see it, you don't
really have any choice, do you?

152
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:14,290
I don't think you do.

153
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,849
Move!

154
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:51,971
They're onto us.

155
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:54,209
Burn 'em out.

156
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,448
This mother's gonna blow big.

157
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:41,770
I don't understand. How could
we lose radio contact all of a sudden?

158
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:44,332
We've lost coms.
Still got 'em on locaters.

159
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,649
- So what's it gonna be?
- What?

160
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:58,809
How do you like your choices?

161
00:13:58,849 --> 00:14:01,890
- I don't.
- That's what I thought.

162
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:04,971
All right, come on.

163
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:08,332
This is the oldest part
of Alcatraz.

164
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,131
Did you know it was originally
a Civil War fort?

165
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:14,050
Oh, really? Huh. Yeah, wow.
You know, I like history, too...

166
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:17,332
and maybe when this is all over,
you and I can stop by
the souvenir shop together.

167
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,529
But right now I just-- I just--
I wanna find some rockets.

168
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,371
Don't tempt me.
We are going to the morgue.

169
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:53,729
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'll do my best.

170
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,488
Your best?

171
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:59,250
Losers always whine
about their best.

172
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:02,131
Winners go home
and fuck the prom queen.

173
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,371
Carla was the prom queen.

174
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:08,971
- Really?
- Yeah.

175
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:13,332
Locaters have them
approaching the morgue, sir.

176
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,809
Come on, come on.
You can do it, Doc.

177
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,491
You must never hesitate.

178
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:50,929
I think you're shooting
too close to the rocket.

179
00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:52,849
Him, but not the rocket.

180
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:55,091
Any other news, Professor?

181
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:00,370
Not the rocket!
Not the rocket.

182
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:17,491
I got a little somethin' for ya.

183
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,810
Oh, yeah, okay. That's just about
the most awful thing I've ever seen.

184
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,370
Mason...

185
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:50,850
the second you don't
respect this, it kills you.

186
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,929
Put it over there.

187
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,810
You've been around a lot
of corpses. Is that normal?

188
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:09,010
- What, the feet thing?
- Yeah, the feet thing.

189
00:17:09,091 --> 00:17:12,249
- Yeah, that happens.
- Well, I'm having kind of
a hard time concentrating.

190
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:16,091
- Can you do something about it?
- Well, like what? Kill him again?

191
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,970
Listen, I'm just a biochemist.

192
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:22,970
And most of the time I work in a glass
jar and lead a very uneventful life.

193
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:27,091
I drive a Volvo, a beige one.
But what I'm dealing with here...

194
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,729
is one of the most deadly substances
the Earth has ever known.

195
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,370
So what do you say you cut me
some friggin' slack?

196
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:49,929
A really elegant
string-of-pearls configuration.

197
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,649
Unfortunately, incredibly unstable.

198
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:54,769
Well, what exactly does this stuff do?

199
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,810
If the rocket renders it aerosol, it can
take out the entire city of people.

200
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:03,571
Really? And what happens
if you drop one?

201
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,970
Happily, it'll just wipe out
you and me.

202
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:09,370
- How?
- It's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

203
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,531
Stops the brain from
sending nerve messages down the
spinal cord within 30 seconds.

204
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:15,571
Any epidermal exposure
or inhalation, and you'll know.

205
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:19,970
A twinge at the small of your back as
the poison seizes your nervous system.

206
00:18:20,051 --> 00:18:21,850
Do not move that!

207
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:27,289
Your muscles freeze,
you can't breathe.

208
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,490
You spasm so hard you break
your own back, spit your guts out.

209
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:33,249
But that's after
your skin melts off.

210
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,649
My God.

211
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:38,890
Oh, I think we'd like God
on our side at the moment, don't you?

212
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:44,091
So what I'm doing now is removing
the guidance system chips...

213
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:46,010
so the rocket will splash down
after 500 feet.

214
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,170
All right, let me have that.

215
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:52,170
You can let go of it. All right,
just back away. Just back away!

216
00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:55,289
Sir, morgue team
has not checked in.

217
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,850
Blackbird One,
this is Blackbird. Over.

218
00:19:01,689 --> 00:19:04,571
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird.
Come in, goddamn it!

219
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:10,091
Somebody's still there.
Let's move!

220
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,370
Rats alive! Close on the morgue.
Close on the morgue.

221
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,249
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go.

222
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,571
Frye, Darrow, hustle up.
We got more company!

223
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,890
Hold it.

224
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,729
Converge on the morgue.
Move out.

225
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,249
Goodspeed, come on.
Come over here.

226
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:32,490
Good. I love pressure.
I eat it for breakfast.

227
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,209
Come on. Time's up.

228
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:36,330
There's three rockets somewhere else.
We have to find them.

229
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,249
Come on!

230
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,970
Clear!

231
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:04,929
I'm too old for this.

232
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,571
- Where's it go?
- I've no idea.

233
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:11,890
Sir, all the guidance chips
are gone.

234
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,010
Captain, I guess you didn't
quite take care of the rat problem.

235
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:16,010
- No, sir.
- Well, there are two dead men here...

236
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:19,490
- who strongly suggest
you go finish the job.
- Yes, sir.

237
00:20:19,571 --> 00:20:22,490
Yes, sir!
Rio, Royce, let's go!

238
00:20:22,571 --> 00:20:24,490
Move out!

239
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:32,408
-You really don't know where this goes?
-No, I don't know where it goes.

240
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,649
Well, it's starting to pick up speed.
Do you know how to slow it down?

241
00:20:34,729 --> 00:20:36,649
No, I don't.

242
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:05,769
God.

243
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:16,209
Mason, you all right?

244
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:18,850
Yes, perfectly okay,
you fucking idiot!

245
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:23,611
- They're coming.
- Who?

246
00:21:23,689 --> 00:21:26,450
- The marines!
- Where?

247
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:29,091
- What the fuck's goin' on?
- Let's cut him off.

248
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,689
No! No! No!

249
00:22:51,611 --> 00:22:53,611
Mason!

250
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:58,370
Mason!

251
00:24:10,507 --> 00:24:15,630
You motherfucker!
Die! Die! Die!

252
00:24:34,988 --> 00:24:38,550
I'm rather glad
you didn't hesitate too long.

253
00:24:41,988 --> 00:24:45,267
How do you do it?

254
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:50,788
Oh, I was trained by the best.
British lntelligence.

255
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:54,708
Come on.

256
00:24:54,747 --> 00:24:58,948
But in retrospect, I'd rather
have been a poet or a farmer.

257
00:24:58,987 --> 00:25:00,670
Okay.

258
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:07,747
Okay, the president arrives
in three hours.

259
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:12,468
His directive is to string Hummel along
until the air strike is operational.

260
00:25:12,547 --> 00:25:15,670
- What's the word from Mohave, General?
- The same as last time, Lou.

261
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,310
They're going as fast as they can.

262
00:25:22,948 --> 00:25:26,870
- Do it over here.
- On your knees. On your knees!

263
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:39,590
Navy SEALs, listen up. You've got
something that belongs to me.

264
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,027
Twelve guidance chips,
to be precise.

265
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:46,590
Let me remind you there are
lives at stake, civilian lives.

266
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,590
Speak up.

267
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:52,508
- Speak up!
- I, uh, uh--

268
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:55,350
- Tell them your name.
- My name is Larry Henderson.

269
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:59,389
- Oh, man.
- And I'm a father of three.

270
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:02,630
And, uh, they've got a gun
to my head.

271
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:06,350
You've got exactly three minutes
to return the guidance chips
to the exercise yard...

272
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:09,029
- or Mr. Henderson won't have a head.
- Oh, no.

273
00:26:10,228 --> 00:26:12,708
Hey. Wha--

274
00:26:12,748 --> 00:26:15,029
Now, three to go.

275
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,070
You find them
and defuse them, okay?

276
00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:20,708
- All right.
- All right.

277
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:24,267
I'll try and delay Hummel
and give you more time.

278
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,429
Hey, what about
Mr. Henderson's head?

279
00:26:29,948 --> 00:26:32,788
Okay? What do you mean?

280
00:26:38,189 --> 00:26:40,109
Okay.

281
00:26:51,547 --> 00:26:54,948
- General.
- Who the hell are you?

282
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:59,029
I'm all that's left
of the enemy.

283
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,070
Bingo.

284
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:24,748
Stand easy.

285
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:31,189
Thought I'd been in the service
a long time.

286
00:27:31,228 --> 00:27:35,350
- Name and rank, sailor.
- Well, it's army, actually.

287
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:40,589
Answer the question.
And address him as "General, sir."

288
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,670
Captain John Patrick Mason,
General, sir...

289
00:27:43,748 --> 00:27:47,508
of Her Majesty's S.A.S.
Retired, of course.

290
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:54,708
You're a long way
from home, Captain.

291
00:27:54,788 --> 00:27:56,350
How the hell are you
involved in this?

292
00:27:56,429 --> 00:27:58,788
Oh, I have a unique knowledge
of this prison facility.

293
00:27:58,869 --> 00:28:02,109
I was, uh, formerly a guest here.

294
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,948
Hi, sweetie.

295
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,869
Hey, come back here, little boy.

296
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,109
Did they bother to tell you
who I am, why I'm doing this?

297
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,390
Or are they just using you
like they do everybody else?

298
00:28:33,468 --> 00:28:37,189
All I know is you were big in Vietnam.
I saw the highlights on television.

299
00:28:37,268 --> 00:28:40,350
Then you wouldn't have any
fuckin' idea what it means
to lead some of the finest men...

300
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,629
on God's earth into battle,
and then see their memory betrayed
by their own fuckin' government.

301
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:46,788
I don't quite see how you cherish
the memory of the dead...

302
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:49,507
by killing another million.

303
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:52,629
And, uh, this is not combat.

304
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:56,788
It's an act of lunacy, General, sir.

305
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:59,468
Personally, I think
you're a fuckin' idiot.

306
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,590
"The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time...

307
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:11,109
with the blood of patriots
and tyrants." Thomas Jefferson.

308
00:29:11,189 --> 00:29:15,987
"Patriotism is the virtue of
the vicious," according to Oscar Wilde.

309
00:29:21,268 --> 00:29:25,268
- Thank you for making my point.
- Where are the guidance chips?

310
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,948
Where are the guidance chips?

311
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:32,029
- I destroyed them.
- That was a bad move, soldier.

312
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:33,987
Does that mean
you'll execute us both?

313
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:04,350
You're lucky that old man Hummel
wants you alive.

314
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:06,390
'Cause I'll take pleasure
in guttin' you, boy.

315
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:16,629
I'd take pleasure
in guttin' you

316
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,189
Boy

317
00:30:18,268 --> 00:30:21,830
"l'll take pleasure
in guttin' you, boy."

318
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,948
What is wrong
with these people, huh, Mason?

319
00:30:24,987 --> 00:30:28,987
Don't you think there's
a lot of, uh, a lot of anger
floatin' around this island?

320
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:32,150
Kind of a pubescent volatility?
Don't you think?

321
00:30:32,228 --> 00:30:36,350
A lot of angst, a lot of, "l'm 16,
I'm angry at my father" syndrome?

322
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:38,390
I mean, grow up!
We're stuck on an island...

323
00:30:38,468 --> 00:30:41,547
with a bunch of
violence-for-pleasure-seeking
psychopathic marines.

324
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:44,189
Shame on them!

325
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:49,948
Anyway, I only got one chem round.
There's two left.

326
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:53,788
- Mason?
- Yes, I'm here.

327
00:30:53,869 --> 00:30:56,308
I was just thinking
how wonderful it was...

328
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,708
when the inmates weren't allowed
to talk in here.

329
00:30:58,747 --> 00:31:01,390
Not allowed to talk.

330
00:31:01,468 --> 00:31:03,547
How'd you do it?

331
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:08,987
Uh, nurtured the hope
that there was hope.

332
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,629
That one day I'd breathe free air.

333
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,948
Perhaps meet my daughter.

334
00:31:14,987 --> 00:31:19,708
Modest hopes, but, uh,
they kept a man alive.

335
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:22,788
What'd they put you
away for, John?

336
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:25,747
Oh, that's a long story.

337
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,629
Well, I'm not goin' anywhere.

338
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:31,708
When was the last communication
from our men on Alcatraz?

339
00:31:31,747 --> 00:31:33,390
Seven hours.

340
00:31:35,788 --> 00:31:38,029
Thermite plasma is operational.

341
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:41,189
- Get me the president.
- Be seated.

342
00:31:41,268 --> 00:31:45,228
Gentlemen, consider yourselves
on ground alert. If we receive
launch authority...

343
00:31:45,308 --> 00:31:48,869
your mission is the complete thermal
destruction of Alcatraz lsland.

344
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:52,308
The entire island is to be blanketed,
not one square inch missed.

345
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:55,067
Eighty-one American civilians
and a number of U.S. Marines...

346
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,390
will lose their lives
in this air strike.

347
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,670
Why didn't you just tell them
where the microfilm was...

348
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:04,547
and, and create a solution?

349
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:09,067
Hmph. The moment they had
the microfilm, they'd suicide me.

350
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,989
- Some solution.
- And you ended up here.

351
00:32:13,067 --> 00:32:17,110
Which brings me to another question.
When you broke out--

352
00:32:17,189 --> 00:32:21,547
Let me see if I can get this straight.
You went down the incinerator chute...

353
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:25,910
on the mine cars, through
the tunnels to the power plant...

354
00:32:25,989 --> 00:32:29,708
under the steam engine--
That was really cool, by the way--

355
00:32:29,788 --> 00:32:32,227
and into the cistern
through the intake pipe.

356
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:37,587
But how, in the name
of Zeus's butthole...

357
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:40,390
did you get out
of your cell?

358
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:43,110
I only ask because
in our current situation...

359
00:32:43,189 --> 00:32:48,268
well, it could prove
to be useful information, maybe!

360
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:08,708
Trade secrets, my son.

361
00:33:09,748 --> 00:33:11,110
Wow.

362
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,547
General,
two operational rockets left.

363
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,268
One's at the lower lighthouse
and there is one on the roof.

364
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:18,268
And both of the birds
are ready to fly, sir.

365
00:33:18,349 --> 00:33:21,509
- G-General, can you hear me?
- I heard you, Captain.

366
00:33:21,547 --> 00:33:24,067
Oh, just makin' sure.

367
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:28,587
Should we prepare
for launch, General?

368
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,670
I'll handle the strategy, Captain.

369
00:33:30,748 --> 00:33:34,189
Yes, sir.

370
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:37,989
The hour is approaching, sir.
Just letting the General know
of the time, sir.

371
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:41,788
- I'm very aware of the time, Captain.
- Aye, aye, sir. Lettin' you know.

372
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,429
Me and my boys are ready to
cock, lock, and ready to rock.

373
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:48,630
Mason, where're you going?

374
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,110
Thirty years ago I vowed
I wouldn't die in this toilet.

375
00:33:51,188 --> 00:33:56,389
You're not leaving! There's a madman in
there with his hand on a, on a button!

376
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,548
Shh. Some sniper's
gonna get his ass.

377
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:03,630
Stop moving, Mason.

378
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:06,110
Mason, stop moving.

379
00:34:06,188 --> 00:34:09,749
Hummel won't do it.
He's a soldier, not a murderer.

380
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:13,188
- I read it in his eyes.
- You read his eyes?

381
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:15,548
Oh, well, then,
everything's just fine!

382
00:34:15,588 --> 00:34:18,309
- I can't afford to take that chance.
- Why don't you talk louder?

383
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:22,467
Three minutes to go, sir.

384
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,588
- They're not gonna call, Frank.
- Oh, they'll call.

385
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,630
They'll call if we fire
one of our rockets up their ass.

386
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:31,588
Sir.

387
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:38,909
- Hummel.
- Hi, Frank. It's AI Kramer here.

388
00:34:38,947 --> 00:34:41,548
- How's it going out there?
- How do you think it's goin'?

389
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,670
- Listen, on this end we're gonna
need another hour, Frank.
- You've got three minutes.

390
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,588
Listen, uh, Frank, we have to get final
authorization from the president.

391
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,670
You've got three minutes.

392
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:51,990
Frank, please don't do
anything stupid.

393
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,349
They want another hour.

394
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,670
Well, that's bullshit.
That's bullshit, General. They're lyin'!

395
00:34:59,749 --> 00:35:01,708
They're calling our bluff, sir.

396
00:35:01,789 --> 00:35:05,510
They're playing you
for a fool, sir.

397
00:35:05,548 --> 00:35:08,708
Order the launch, General.

398
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:12,229
Come on, General.
Let's be all we can be.

399
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,030
The mission's not complete!

400
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,947
Well, mine is.

401
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,708
When this is over,
you'll go back home...

402
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:37,630
driving Carla and your baby insane
in your beige Volvo.

403
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:41,188
And I'll be dead or back in prison,
which is the same thing.

404
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:43,309
You're not leaving.

405
00:35:47,588 --> 00:35:51,467
All right, I'll do it myself.

406
00:35:52,909 --> 00:35:54,947
I got three weeks'
weapons training.

407
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:58,829
I'll kick the-- Out of
a platoon full of marines.

408
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:01,588
No problem.

409
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:15,670
- Major, patch me into Roof Battery.
- Aye, sir.

410
00:36:15,749 --> 00:36:19,110
Fire open control circuit
coordinates to the roof, sir.

411
00:36:19,789 --> 00:36:21,467
Let's go!

412
00:36:26,588 --> 00:36:28,789
Laser powered up!

413
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:33,909
- Oh, no.
- I said, on your knees!

414
00:36:33,947 --> 00:36:38,429
My name's Stanley Goodspeed. I'm a
chemical weapons specialist for the FBl.

415
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,429
- Uh, glass or plastic?
- What?

416
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:42,990
- Glass or plastic? Glass or plastic?
- Shut the fuck up!

417
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:45,670
Because if the winds change
after you launch those rockets...

418
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:47,708
- we're all gonna die.
- Shut up!

419
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,670
And you're gonna end up in either
a glass jar or a plastic bag.

420
00:36:51,749 --> 00:36:54,990
So, what do you say you do the math,
h-hand over the gun...

421
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:58,349
- and let's go find some rockets?
- I said shut the fuck--

422
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:09,389
- You made the right choice.
- I decided I didn't want your child...

423
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:12,150
growing up without a father.

424
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:14,990
Hey, the last time I swam
this channel I was your age.

425
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:18,030
So, I'm fucked either way.
So, come on.

426
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,869
Weapon is hot. I am standing by
for the launch command.

427
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,588
Man, killing Navy SEALs
is one thing--

428
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:26,947
- Is this for real?
- Hey, it's business.

429
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,990
Access code entered.
Weapon available for release.

430
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,909
Launch coordinates: six, seven,

431
00:37:34,947 --> 00:37:38,030
five, four, five, niner.

432
00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:44,309
The weapon is hot.
I'm standing by for launch command.

433
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:46,349
That's affirmative.

434
00:37:52,749 --> 00:37:55,110
Standing by for command.

435
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:05,269
I'm waiting for
launch command, General.

436
00:38:13,548 --> 00:38:15,789
- Fire.
- Fire!

437
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,749
Missile loose!
Missile loose!

438
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:32,429
Origin:
Alcatraz, 67253725.

439
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,429
- What's the goddamn heading?
- Heading 185 degrees south southeast.

440
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:40,630
- Speed?
- Three hundred knots.
It's headed right at Oakland.

441
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:43,030
Football game.

442
00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:47,068
Oh, my God.

443
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,990
Missile radically
changing direction.

444
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:21,110
New direction: 275 degrees west.
It's headed out to sea, sir.

445
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:24,708
Oh, Christ!

446
00:39:24,789 --> 00:39:27,068
Missile losing altitude. Falling.

447
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,909
Falling, 300 feet, 200, 100.

448
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,789
Bogey detonated
under water.

449
00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:42,030
What the fuck?

450
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,429
It missed.

451
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,548
- Well, that's great.
- Extremely great.

452
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,829
But there's still one left.

453
00:39:48,909 --> 00:39:52,467
What happened to the rocket? What
the fuck happened to the coordinates?

454
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,909
What the fuck is going on?
Sir! Major!

455
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,869
- Captain, step outside.
- Talk to me, sir.

456
00:39:58,947 --> 00:40:00,869
Captain, step outside!

457
00:40:13,749 --> 00:40:15,947
Get me the Pentagon.

458
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:32,269
What the hell was that, Frank?

459
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:35,309
- I said, what the hell--
- I heard what you said!
lf you're gonna be insubordinate...

460
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:38,829
- I'd appreciate it if you'd do
it with a little more respect.
- Cut the crap, General.

461
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,749
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not ready to kill these people.

462
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:42,789
- Call the Pentagon. Ask for more time.
- No!

463
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:45,829
Do it, Frank!
We're coming loose.

464
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:48,909
You're coming loose.
The rest of us are in complete control.

465
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,829
- We're askin' 'em.
We're askin' 'em for a new deadline.
- Put the phone down.

466
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:53,708
- The men are falling apart.
- The men are marines!

467
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:57,269
Are they?

468
00:40:57,349 --> 00:40:59,869
- I wanna talk to General Kramer.
- You've been asked by an old friend.

469
00:40:59,947 --> 00:41:02,389
- Put him on the phone right now.
- You've been ordered
by a superior officer.

470
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:05,349
-This is Major Baxter.
-Now you're being given your
last chance by a man with a gun.

471
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,787
Put the phone down.

472
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:14,028
- I thought you weren't ready to kill.
- I'm warmin' up.

473
00:41:15,467 --> 00:41:17,349
At ease.

474
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,028
They need a decision,
Mr. President.

475
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:39,150
These past few hours...

476
00:41:39,229 --> 00:41:42,909
have been the longest,
darkest of my life.

477
00:41:42,988 --> 00:41:46,988
How does one weigh human life?

478
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:50,429
One million civilians
against 81 hostages.

479
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,988
And in the middle, Frank Hummel.

480
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:59,708
That we have ignored,
abandoned or marginalized...

481
00:41:59,787 --> 00:42:02,188
a great soldier like Frank Hummel...

482
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:06,947
and that American boys have paid
for that neglect in blood...

483
00:42:06,988 --> 00:42:11,070
is equally real
and equally tragic.

484
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:16,787
We are at war with terror.

485
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:19,070
Fighting a war means casualties.

486
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,467
This is the worst call
I've ever had to make.

487
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,947
Air strike approved.

488
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:33,869
Red Thunder to tower.
Request clearance.

489
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:37,467
With the amount of firepower
they're gonna drop in there...

490
00:42:37,508 --> 00:42:40,747
- Tower this is Strike Leader.
Prepared to go.
- it'll be over in a few seconds.

491
00:42:40,787 --> 00:42:43,110
Flight time to drop point: 17 minutes.

492
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:53,869
Excuse me, General, sir,
with all due respect to you,
but what the fuck is going on?

493
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:57,070
- You changed the coordinates,
didn't you, General?
- That's affirmative, Captain.

494
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:00,988
So, now they think we're
gutless, the Feds? They think
we won't actually do it.

495
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:03,869
They're gonna come at us with everything
they've got. Air and sea.

496
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:07,947
- They're gonna bomb our ass
back to the Stone Age.
- They don't know we missed on purpose.

497
00:43:07,988 --> 00:43:13,508
Great. We're not gutless,
we're incompetent. That right?

498
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:17,269
I don't think I like your tone, Captain.
We planned for this contingency.

499
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:19,829
Load the V.X. into the choppers,
take four hostages and evacuate.

500
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:21,787
The consequences of our actions
I'll face alone.

501
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:25,229
Excuse me, General,
but what about the fucking money?

502
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:27,670
There is no fucking money.
Mission's over.

503
00:43:27,747 --> 00:43:29,467
Bullshit it's over.

504
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:33,028
You're talking to a General, soldier.
Maintain discipline.

505
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,028
I'm not a soldier, Major.

506
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:39,630
The day we took hostages we became
mercenaries. And mercenaries get paid!

507
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:42,269
I want my fucking money!

508
00:43:42,349 --> 00:43:45,947
This mission was based
on the threat of force.

509
00:43:46,028 --> 00:43:49,909
I'm not about to kill 80,000
innocent people. Do you think
I'm out of my fucking mind?

510
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:54,747
We bluffed. They called it.
The mission's over.

511
00:43:59,028 --> 00:44:01,508
Whoever said anything
about bluffing, General?

512
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:03,429
Stand down, Captain.

513
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:10,070
Stand down, Captain!

514
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:18,590
Major, I'm ordering you to take
these men to the choppers and evacuate.

515
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:25,389
- That's a simple order, Major!
- It's not so simple, Frank.

516
00:44:25,467 --> 00:44:27,829
Sergeant Crisp...

517
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:30,590
secure the General.

518
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,947
I'm relieving you
of your command, sir.

519
00:44:37,269 --> 00:44:39,229
Sergeant!

520
00:44:45,909 --> 00:44:49,150
- I'll have that sidearm, sir.
- You mean this sidearm?

521
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:00,349
Major Baxter, you're either
with us or against us.

522
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:08,708
It has been the greatest honor
of my life to serve with you, General.

523
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:16,269
But like he said...

524
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,070
it's over.

525
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:37,429
Let's get him.

526
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:44,829
Mason!

527
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:51,150
- My God, what have I done?
- Where's the last rocket?
Where's the last rocket?

528
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:56,909
- Where's the last rocket?
- Lower lighthouse.

529
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:59,590
- Lower lighthouse.
- Go!

530
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,070
Darrow, go to the lighthouse.
I'll take care of this fucker!

531
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:25,188
One, two, three! Eat that!

532
00:46:38,909 --> 00:46:40,389
Did it.

533
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:14,429
Come here. Come here,
you little chicken shit!

534
00:47:14,508 --> 00:47:17,670
You shoot me, I drop this.
We're both dead.

535
00:47:17,747 --> 00:47:19,909
Well, come on. Come on.
Don't be scared. I won't hurt ya.

536
00:47:19,988 --> 00:47:22,070
- Come on.
- Do you know how this shit works?

537
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:24,269
You know how this shit works?

538
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,110
Come on. Come on.

539
00:47:30,188 --> 00:47:32,188
I don't need the gun.
I'll put it down.

540
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:36,467
Come on. Let's play.
Come on. Come on.

541
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:41,028
Listen, I think we got
started off on the wrong foot.
Stan Goodspeed, FBl. Uh--

542
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:44,188
Let's talk music. Do you like
the Elton John song, "Rocket Man"?

543
00:47:44,269 --> 00:47:46,269
I don't like soft-ass shit.

544
00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:48,429
Oh, you-- Oh, oh. Oh.

545
00:47:48,508 --> 00:47:52,349
Well, I only bring it up
because, uh, it's you.

546
00:47:52,429 --> 00:47:54,869
You're the Rocket Man.

547
00:47:56,429 --> 00:47:58,188
No!

548
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:04,150
- How do you like how that shit works?
- Second rocket's away!

549
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:13,670
It splashed into the bay, sir.
No detonation.

550
00:48:14,947 --> 00:48:17,269
Shit!

551
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:38,467
Darrow!

552
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,550
Open up!

553
00:48:43,188 --> 00:48:44,869
Come on.

554
00:48:44,947 --> 00:48:46,590
Open up!

555
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:16,829
Hey, you mother!

556
00:49:48,988 --> 00:49:51,429
Oh, I'm gonna get you now, baby.

557
00:49:54,869 --> 00:49:57,389
Okay.

558
00:49:59,389 --> 00:50:00,988
I got ya. I got you, baby.

559
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:04,467
Come on.

560
00:50:19,869 --> 00:50:21,188
Fucker!

561
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:48,670
Red Thunder Strike Leader.

562
00:50:48,747 --> 00:50:51,070
Time on target: seven minutes.

563
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:10,429
English prick.
I tell you my old man was lrish?

564
00:51:13,188 --> 00:51:15,829
Maintain air speed 450 knots.

565
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,869
Fuck!

566
00:51:41,467 --> 00:51:43,467
It's me and you, pal.

567
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:45,909
I want that fucking chip!

568
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:57,708
I love pressure.

569
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:07,467
I know you're in here,
and I know you can hear me.

570
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:09,909
Now, pay the piper
and come out like a man.

571
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:40,550
Increase speed
to 500 knots.

572
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:43,269
You motherfucker! Die!

573
00:52:47,787 --> 00:52:51,630
I'm gonna choke my million bucks
out of you. You're gonna die.

574
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:54,467
Eat that, you fuck!

575
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:24,028
All right, team, inbound.
Time on target: 60 seconds.

576
00:53:28,869 --> 00:53:32,747
Come to course heading
142 degrees.

577
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:42,188
When he neutralizes the threat...

578
00:53:42,269 --> 00:53:45,309
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

579
00:53:49,787 --> 00:53:53,349
- Let's tighten up that formation.
- May God have mercy on your souls.

580
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:56,508
Please don't let this happen. There has
to be something you can do. Please.

581
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:09,630
Let's drop to the deck.
One hundred feet below radar.

582
00:54:19,309 --> 00:54:21,630
Target acquired.
Rolling in.

583
00:54:24,909 --> 00:54:28,670
This is Red Thunder.
Master armed. Master armed.

584
00:54:29,909 --> 00:54:32,389
Time on target: 12 seconds.

585
00:54:34,747 --> 00:54:37,787
T.O.T.: ten seconds.

586
00:54:41,708 --> 00:54:43,550
Stay tight, gentlemen.

587
00:54:46,229 --> 00:54:48,070
I got green smoke.
I got green smoke!

588
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:51,309
This is C.Q. One, C.Q. One!
Green smoke! We have green smoke! Over.

589
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:53,550
- Eh, gimme that! Gimme that! Abort!
- Abort!

590
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:56,269
- Flight leader, abort, abort, abort!
- Jesus Chri--

591
00:54:58,389 --> 00:55:00,947
I already dropped them!

592
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:13,467
- Oh, goddamn it!
- Oh, my God!

593
00:55:16,028 --> 00:55:18,909
Get out of my way. Let me through,
please. Let me through!

594
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:26,909
The cells did not get hit. The bombs
hit on the back of the island.

595
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:53,787
I'm fed up saving your ass.
I'm amazed you ever got past puberty.

596
00:55:53,869 --> 00:55:57,670
I suppose all this will make
a great bedtime story to tell your kid.

597
00:55:57,747 --> 00:56:02,947
You're insane, Mason.
The kid'll have nightmares.
Spend all my money on shrinks.

598
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:05,988
Goodspeed, come in.

599
00:56:06,028 --> 00:56:09,070
Goodspeed, Goodspeed,
do you read me? Come in!

600
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:12,550
- Scanning all radio frequencies.
- Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!

601
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:17,309
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Come in!

602
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:25,829
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Come in!

603
00:56:25,909 --> 00:56:28,550
This is Goodspeed.

604
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:34,349
- Are the hostages alive?
- Every one of 'em.

605
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:39,747
Goodspeed, it's Womack.

606
00:56:39,787 --> 00:56:42,467
What about Mason?

607
00:56:49,269 --> 00:56:51,550
- He's dead, sir.
- How? When?

608
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:54,188
Just come and get me.

609
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:59,630
Womack tore up your pardon, John.

610
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:02,309
But, of course.
I knew he would.

611
00:57:02,389 --> 00:57:05,429
The S.D.U.s and the scuba gear
should still be where we came ashore.

612
00:57:05,508 --> 00:57:10,070
If you can get to the
Pan Pacific Hotel, there's clothes
in my closet, $200 in the Bible.

613
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:12,590
Room 26.

614
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:16,988
Well, it's been a long time
since I've said thank you to anybody.

615
00:57:18,787 --> 00:57:21,909
But thank you.

616
00:57:21,988 --> 00:57:27,630
Well, Stanley, uh, this is when
we go our separate ways, huh?

617
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:32,070
But, uh, I'm sure you know
the etymology of your name "Goodspeed."

618
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:36,150
Yeah, Godspeed: to wish someone
a prosperous journey. Why?

619
00:57:36,229 --> 00:57:39,829
Well, if you fancy a journey...

620
00:57:39,909 --> 00:57:42,909
I recommend Fort Walton, Kansas.

621
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:45,829
I was thinking of Maui.

622
00:57:45,909 --> 00:57:48,070
No.

623
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:54,349
Forget Maui.

624
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:03,510
"St. Michael's Church,
Fort Walton, Kansas.

625
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,829
"Front pew, right leg.

626
00:58:05,869 --> 00:58:08,630
Hollow."

627
00:58:08,709 --> 00:58:11,309
Is this what I think it is?

628
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:15,709
Mason?

629
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:31,630
-Congratulations, Dr. Goodspeed.
You did it.
-Thank you, sir.

630
00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:34,430
You know, for a while there,
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

631
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,829
Well done, son.

632
00:58:36,869 --> 00:58:38,470
So, where's Mason?

633
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:42,470
Vaporized. Blown out to sea.

634
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:44,829
Blown out to sea, huh?

635
00:58:44,909 --> 00:58:47,269
Yeah.

636
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:52,188
Poor bastard.

637
00:58:52,269 --> 00:58:57,070
Goodspeed, where's Mason? Where's his
body? I wanna see that son of a bitch!

638
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:00,630
Vaporized, sir.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

639
00:59:00,709 --> 00:59:05,150
What? Vaporized?
A body can vaporize?

640
00:59:05,229 --> 00:59:08,269
Oh, yeah!
Absolutely, sir.

641
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:14,909
St. Michael's Church,
front pew, right leg.

642
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:16,869
Front pew, right leg.

643
00:59:16,909 --> 00:59:18,909
Vandals! Vandals!

644
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:21,110
Oh, yes, baby, come on!

645
00:59:21,188 --> 00:59:24,869
- Stop! Vandals! Stop!
- I'm sorry!

646
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:27,709
- Come on, baby!
- I've got it! Okay, let's go!

647
00:59:27,789 --> 00:59:30,950
- Stop! Stop!
- Sorry!

648
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:34,150
Stop! Hey, hey, you!

649
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:38,829
Vandals! Vandals!

650
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:43,829
Honey, uh, you wanna knowwho really killed J.F.K.?
