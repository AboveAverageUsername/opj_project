3
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:44,999
We can't hold out much longer, sir!

4
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:14,400
General Hummel, you've gotta
get us outta here now!

5
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,998
I won't let you down.
I won't let you down, son.

6
00:01:22,638 --> 00:01:26,799
Goddamn it, sir! How long do we have
to wait? I've lost 15 men already!

7
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,400
Sir, they're lightin' us up
like a firestorm!

8
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,680
This is General Hummel.
You gotta get my men outta there!

9
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,200
We don't have clearance
to go behind enemy lines, sir.

10
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:40,799
They're not coming for us,
are they, sir?

11
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,319
Congressman Weaver
and esteemed members...

12
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,120
of the Special Armed Services
Committee.

13
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,400
I come before you to protest
a grave injustice.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Aim!

15
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,199
It has to stop.

16
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:57,837
I miss you so much.

17
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,280
There's something I've gotta do, Barb.

18
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:12,117
Something I couldn't do
while you were here.

19
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,878
I tried.
You know I tried everything.

20
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:21,038
And I still don't have
their attention.

21
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,837
Let's hope this elevates
their thinking.

22
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:27,199
But whatever happens...

23
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:31,679
please don't think less of me.

24
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,478
Marine, inform the garrison C.O...

25
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,278
that General Hummel's coming on
board with a security inspection team.

26
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,959
Yes, sir.
Sir, it's an honor having you, sir.

27
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:52,439
Ya know, at least
we can get some--

28
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,439
- A long time before guard meeting, huh?
- Yeah, I'll tell ya.

29
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I got the access card. We've got
30 minutes 'til those darts wear off.

30
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,120
Move it!

31
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,598
The access card, sir.

32
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:26,079
Let's do it.

33
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,920
2400 magazine check.

34
00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:49,439
- Man, it's wet out there!
- Check me through, will ya?

35
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,240
Clear!

36
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,240
- I want 16, Major!
- Move it!

37
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,920
Evac! Seal the door!

38
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,120
- No!
- Come on, man!
- No!
- Seal it!

39
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,920
- No!
- Seal it!
- Help!

40
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:07,319
Let me outta here! Oh, God!
Let me outta here! Oh, God!

41
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,439
Let me out! Let me out!

42
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,439
Clear out.
Get outta here!

43
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:22,718
Sorry.

44
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,079
Let's move out.

45
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,319
Two more cc's
of acetylene chloride.

46
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:51,199
- That'll be five dollars, lsherwood.
- You suck.

47
00:07:57,718 --> 00:08:00,360
You guys have too much time
on your hands.

48
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,240
Yes! She's here! Bring it
to me now. Thank you, Phil!

49
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,478
What's that?
Why'd you get it sent here?

50
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,519
Carla wouldn't approve. She thinks
it's dumb to spend $600 on an L.P.

51
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,718
Carla's right. Why don't you
just spend $13 on a CD, man?

52
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,879
First of all,
it's because I'm a Beatlemaniac.

53
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:20,319
And second,
these sound better.

54
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,237
Could be serious.
Could be sarin gas.

55
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,279
A dog out of JFK caught a whiff
of something in this package...

56
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,198
postmarked to
a Bosnian refugee camp.

57
00:08:32,238 --> 00:08:34,999
It could be detergent,
or it could be sarin gas.

58
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:36,879
Bosnian refugee camp?

59
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,159
Half a million Serbians
reside in the U.S., Marvin.
Serbians don't like Bosnians.

60
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:42,399
You guys wanna get suited up?

61
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,879
- You bring the cockroaches?
- Got 'em.

62
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,999
We have air lock, Stanley.
You're all set to go.

63
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,359
October 1, 0900 hours.

64
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,999
Agent Stanley Goodspeed,
Agent/Trainee Marvin lsherwood...

65
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:05,239
initiating exam
of wooden crate.

66
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,599
Suspicion of sarin gas inside.

67
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,119
- Marvin, sarin is a--
- G.B. aerosol.

68
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,799
That is correct.

69
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:15,039
Now, let's see.
We have some dirty magazines.

70
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:17,039
Stone Age Cave Girls
in the Raw.

71
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:21,078
Kinky. And, uh--
Not a good sign.

72
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,159
Hello, little baby doll.

73
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:26,200
Lookit, Stan.

74
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,320
- Hi there, Stanley.
- Marvin!
- Marvin, don't!

75
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,559
- Hi, Stan.
- Shit! Move back! Move back!

76
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,200
- I want the exhaust.
- Hang on, guys.

77
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:38,559
We'll have that room clear
in 50 seconds! You're gonna be okay.

78
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,879
Jesus Christ!

79
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:45,479
Okay, I've got some bad news
and some really bad news.

80
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:48,799
The bad news is that the gas is
corrosive and it's eating our suits.

81
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,919
- It's all over my hand, man!
- The really bad news...

82
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:55,559
is there's enough C-4 explosive and
poison gas to blow the whole chamber...

83
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:58,599
-and kill everybody
in the building.
-Detonation too heavy.
-Everybody, out of the room now!

84
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,958
Seal us inside.

85
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,679
- Where are the sprinklers, Lonner?
- The acid's eating my su--

86
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:11,039
It's eating my fucking suit!
All right? Shit!

87
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:14,440
- Just wash us off!
- Where are my sprinklers?

88
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:16,279
We're working on it.
It's coming. It's just a flow problem.

89
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:18,879
Well, that's a pretty big
friggin' problem, Lonner. Fix it now!

90
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,159
- We're working on it! How much time
do you have on that detonator?
- A minute ten.

91
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:24,399
- Look at this!
- We're gonna have the room clear.

92
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:27,399
- Tell 'em to take the atropine, now!
- The atropine, lsherwood.

93
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:30,078
- What?
- Where's my water, Lonner? One minute!

94
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,320
- Marvin, the atropine, now!
- Inject it in your heart
before your suit melts.

95
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,799
Shit!

96
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,679
Make him take his dose.

97
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,999
- Where's that water?
- Get that away from me!

98
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,479
Come on, Phil, fix it
for Christ's sake!

99
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,799
- Take the atropine now, Stan,
for Christ's sake!
- We're fucked.

100
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,759
The poison's mixing.

101
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,559
What the fuck are you
waiting for, Stanley?
You take the fucking needle now!

102
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,119
- Fuck! Shit! Oh, fuck, shit!
- Forty seconds!

103
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,519
If that suit melts--
If you die, we all die!

104
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:03,078
Inject your heart
and then diffuse the bomb!

105
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:06,159
- Come on, just do it, Stan!
- Shit! What if I miss my heart?
I can't see shit!

106
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:10,999
-Do it now!
-Look how big this is. You want
me to stick this into my heart?

107
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:14,479
- Are you fucking nuts?
- The sprinkler's coming! It's coming!

108
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,559
Okay, here we go, man!

109
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,078
Sprinkler activated.

110
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:23,039
How much time left?

111
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:25,359
Twenty seconds!

112
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,320
We're not gonna make it.

113
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,440
Fifteen.

114
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,039
Oh, come on.

115
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:38,320
Clear!

116
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,639
Get me the fuck out of this gas chamber!

117
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,078
I almost stabbed myself
in the heart with this thing.

118
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,559
Please lock me away

119
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,039
- Stan?
- Hey, darlin'.

120
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:52,559
Hi, baby.

121
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,679
Here inside where I hide
with my loneliness

122
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,239
I had such
an interesting day today.

123
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,679
Yeah, I had kind of
an interesting day myself.

124
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,719
Oh, okay, you go first.

125
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:10,078
Oh, just some terrorists decided to send
a little care package, box of goodies...

126
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,119
which had to be neutralized
before blowing up the office.

127
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,879
So I took the rest of the day off.

128
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,719
Glass of wine, little guitar.
Just relaxing.

129
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:24,078
- Wow!
- I mean it, honey. The world is being
Fed-Ex'd to hell on a handcart.

130
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:27,119
I really believe that anyone
who's even thinking about
having a child in this world...

131
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,559
is coldly considering
an act of cruelty.

132
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,399
I know, I'm rambling,
I'm complaining. I'm sorry.

133
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:36,719
- What's your news, baby?
- I'm pregnant.

134
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:39,919
I'm sorry?

135
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,799
I'm pregnant.

136
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,279
- Really?
- Yeah.

137
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:50,239
-Wow!
-Is that all you're gonna say, is "wow"?

138
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,759
- You're pregnant?
- Three weeks.

139
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,999
How do you know? I mean,
h-how do you know?

140
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:01,440
Blue! Just turned blue
so I went to the doctor.

141
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,440
- Well, you didn't mean what
you just said, did you?
- When?

142
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,559
Uh, just right now when you were talking
about bringing a child into the world...

143
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:09,440
and having it be
an act of cruelty.

144
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,359
-I meant it at the time.
-Stanley, at the time? You said
it seven and a half seconds ago.

145
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,679
Well, gosh!

146
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:18,999
Kind of a lot's happened since then.
Look, we're not even married.

147
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:23,919
- I know. It's funny
you should mention that.
- It's funny?

148
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:26,999
- Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.

149
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,119
Good.

150
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:36,399
- Will you marry me?
- Whoa! Whoa! Wai-- Hey,
Marriage Police, pull over!

151
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:39,320
Come on, Stanley.
I'm proposing to you right now.

152
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,440
The Rock is the most famous and was
the most feared prison ever built.

153
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:54,879
Is it really true that
there's never been an escape?

154
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,999
Ah, that's true. From 1936 until
'63 when the prison closed...

155
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:00,839
there were 14 attempts.

156
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:06,359
No one is believed to have made
it to shore, alive at least.

157
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,479
No, uh, h-h-hey, hey, fellas. I'm sorry,
but tourists are not allowed back here.

158
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,919
- I don't really give a shit!
Do you give a shit?
- No.

159
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:14,359
- Come here, fruity.
- Move!

160
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,159
- Hey, girls? Hi.
You all havin' a good time?
- Yeah.

161
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:20,958
Will you do something for me?
It's really, it's really important.

162
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,999
I need you to tell your teacher
that you need to get back on
the boat and go home right now.

163
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:28,159
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Broadway!

164
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:30,200
This cell block housed...

165
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:33,679
the most awesome scum in America.

166
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:36,279
Ladies and gentlemen,
l, Ranger Bob...

167
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:40,879
cordially invite you to become inmates
of Alcatraz, temporarily, of course.

168
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,759
On the line!

169
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:50,159
Pretty tight quarters,
aren't they, huh?

170
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:52,519
Like being a caged animal.

171
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:55,119
Spend a couple of years in there--

172
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:58,320
- What's the matter, fellas?
Something wrong with the tour?
- The tour's over, Bob.

173
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,479
What kind of fucked-up tour
is this?

174
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,479
General Hummel, Captains Frye
and Darrow reporting, sir.

175
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:27,200
Welcome to The Rock, gentlemen.
Land the choppers on the
back side and deploy as planned.

176
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,559
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir. Move out!

177
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,559
I'm not allowed
to carry a gun.

178
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,279
Oh, you're not allowed to carry
a gun? I got a goddamned gun.

179
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,958
If I'd have known this was
gonna happen, I'd have brought
my motherfuckin' gun! Help!

180
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:44,239
All right, gentlemen, this'll be
our new home. Tom, I want
my command center right here.

181
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,078
- I want Coms up.
- Roger that, sir.

182
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,359
Put the satellite over there.
I wanna be up at 1600.

183
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,279
Let's move it.

184
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:13,399
- Systems up.
- Possible penetration point
in the shower room.

185
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:16,759
- We're setting anti-intrusion.
- I brought a personal touch, sir.

186
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,719
It's an anti-motion trembler device.
It's custom-made.

187
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,320
Nobody knows about it
and nobody expects it.

188
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:26,599
- What's it do?
- We head-fake 'em with the laser beam.

189
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,519
And then if they disturb
Mr. Backup here, we own 'em.

190
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:47,078
Ladies and gentlemen, you're being
detained against your will.

191
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:49,399
For that, I apologize.

192
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:51,479
It is not our intention
in any way to harm you.

193
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:54,799
You will not be detained one
minute longer than is necessary
for us to complete our mission.

194
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,317
Attention on deck!

195
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:06,959
Stand easy, men.

196
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,640
Make no mistake about it, gentlemen,
we are now in harm's way.

197
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:16,160
For Major Baxter and l,
this is the last campaign
in a career datin' back to Tet '68.

198
00:17:17,557 --> 00:17:19,999
Likewise for Captain Hendrix,
Gunnery Sergeant Crisp,

199
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,719
who cut their teeth
under my command in Desert Storm.

200
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,239
Captain Frye, Captain Darrow,
this is my first operational
situation with you and your men.

201
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:29,999
And I have to say, thus far
your conduct reflects your reputations.

202
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,959
- Thank you, General.
- Thank you, sir.

203
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:35,359
We have achieved our position
through poise, precision and audacity.

204
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
To this we must now add resolve.

205
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,839
We'll be branded as traitors,
the gravest capital crime.

206
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,999
Punishable by death.

207
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,200
A couple hundred years ago...

208
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:48,759
a few guys named Washington,
Jefferson and Adams...

209
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:51,999
were branded as traitors
by the British.

210
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:54,798
And now they're called patriots.

211
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,798
In time, so shall we.

212
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,479
God willing,
in less than 48 hours...

213
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:05,920
you will evacuate this island
in gunships under cover of
hostages and V.X. gas warheads.

214
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:09,359
Your destination:
a non-extradition treaty country.

215
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,839
You will each be paid a fee
of $1 million for services rendered.

216
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,519
But you can never again
set foot on your native soil.

217
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:21,359
- Can you live with that?
- Yes, sir!

218
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,119
The men of
Marine Force Recon...

219
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,640
are selected to carry out
illegal operations throughout the world.

220
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,959
When they don't come home...

221
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,680
their families are told fairy tales
about what happened to them...

222
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:36,839
and denied compensation.

223
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,239
Well, I have choked
on these lies my entire career!

224
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:42,719
Well, here and now the lies stop!

225
00:18:48,278 --> 00:18:51,920
God be with all of you.
Man your positions, men.

226
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:57,959
This is FBI Director Womack.

227
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:01,440
Director, be advised.

228
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:04,160
Eighty-one, I say again,

229
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:06,440
81 civilians are under
my control as of this moment.

230
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,920
81 civilians are under
my control as of this moment.

231
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:12,119
You are to take measures to assure this
remains a need-to-know classified fact.

232
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,519
Who is this?

233
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,239
Mr. Director, you have
a very serious problem.

234
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:18,959
A battery of V.X. gas rockets
is presently deployed...

235
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,160
to deliver a highly
lethal strike on the population
of the San Francisco Bay area.

236
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:27,440
-I will call again at 0100 hours
to state my demands.
-I want to know who I'm talking to.

237
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,519
This is Brigadier General
Francis X. Hummel, United States
Marine Corps, from Alcatraz.

238
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,680
Out!

239
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,798
- I'll cancel your reservations.
- Get the Pentagon.

240
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,680
And call the San Francisco office.
It seems Alcatraz was just reopened.

241
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Last night General Hummel,
using brutal but nonlethal force...

242
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:51,519
under the guise of a security
exercise, walked off with 15
V.X. poison gas rockets.

243
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,557
He lost one of his own men
in the process.

244
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,160
That's General Hummel in Vietnam.
I think he was a major at the time.

245
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:01,317
Three tours in Vietnam,
Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm.

246
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,160
Three Purple Hearts,
two Silver Stars...

247
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:05,920
and the Congressional Medal of--

248
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:09,079
Jesus! This man is a hero!

249
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:11,557
Well, I think "legend" might be
a better description, Mr. Sinclair.

250
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,920
Well, now we can add kidnapping
and extortion to his list of accolades.

251
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:17,400
Mr. Sinclair, General Hummel
is a man of honor.

252
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,557
General, it's him.

253
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,479
Frank, it's AI Kramer.

254
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,317
Hi, Al, how you doin'?

255
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,680
I don't know, Frank.
Ah, why don't you tell me.

256
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:31,479
Got a lot of very, very
worried people here, Frank.

257
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:33,400
I'll come straight to the point.

258
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,798
Eight-three Force Reconnaissance Marines
have died under my various commands.

259
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,160
Forty-seven in northern Laos
and southern China.

260
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,278
Southern China? We never admitted
we sent troops into China.

261
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,557
Who is this?
ldentify yourself.

262
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,400
White House Chief of Staff
Hayden Sinclair, General.

263
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:52,079
- How old are you,
Chief of Staff Sinclair?
- I'm 33.

264
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,160
Well, Mr. Sinclair, you've probably got
no fucking idea what I'm talking about.

265
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:58,519
By your ninth birthday, I was
runnin' black ops into China...

266
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:01,519
and my men were responsible
f-for over 200 enemy kills.

267
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:06,278
Al, put some rigging tape over Mr.
Sinclair's mouth. He's wasting my time.

268
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,759
Ah, you want to continue, Frank?

269
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,959
Remember Operation Desert Storm?

270
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:13,680
Those surgical hits made by
our smart bombs, covered so well on CNN?

271
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,200
It was my men on the ground
that made those hits possible
by lasing the targets.

272
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,599
Twenty of them were left to rot outside
Baghdad after the conflict ended.

273
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,160
No benefits were paid
to their families.

274
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:27,519
No medals conferred.

275
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,798
These men died for their country,
and they weren't even given
a goddamn military burial.

276
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:37,719
The situation is unacceptable.
You will transfer $100 million...

277
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,519
from the Grand Cayman Red Sea
Trading Company account
to an account I designate.

278
00:21:41,557 --> 00:21:44,200
From these funds, reparations
of $1 million will be paid...

279
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:46,719
to each of
the 83 marines' families.

280
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:50,200
The rest of the funds I will
disperse at my discretion.

281
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:52,400
Do I make myself clear?

282
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,719
Except for the Red Sea Trading Company.
What is that?

283
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:58,640
- Identify yourself.
- This is FBI Director Womack, General.

284
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:02,239
It's a slush fund where the Pentagon
keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.

285
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:04,719
Jesus, Frank!
This is classified information.

286
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,359
You alert the media,
I launch the gas.

287
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,038
You refuse payment,
I launch the gas.

288
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,880
You've got 40 hours,
'til noon day after tomorrow
to arrange transfer of the money.

289
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:18,759
I am aware of your
countermeasure. You know and I
know it doesn't stand a chance.

290
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,479
Hummel from Alcatraz. Out.

291
00:22:22,557 --> 00:22:27,239
All right. We have to identify
the hostages and contact
each of their families.

292
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:31,079
Uh, tell 'em somethin'. Make up a story,
and we've got to keep this undercover.

293
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,239
If this comes out, the city
of San Francisco will be
in chaos. I am talking anarchy.

294
00:22:35,317 --> 00:22:38,759
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What is the potential casualty rate...

295
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:43,798
for a single rocket armed with
V.X. poison gas, General Peterson?

296
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:46,798
- Sixty or seventy.
- Well, that's, that's not so bad.

297
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,557
- Thousand. Seventy thousand dead!
- Oh.

298
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,119
One teaspoon of this hits the floor,
it's lethal up to a hundred feet.

299
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,880
One teaspoon of this shit
detonated in the atmosphere...

300
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:02,798
will kill every living organism
in an eight-block radius.

301
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,160
Get the point?

302
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:07,680
Uh, what did Hummel mean
by your countermeasure, General?

303
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,798
Standard poison is countered
by napalm. It burns it up,
consumes it upon detonation.

304
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,119
Now, the problem
with V.X. poison gas is...

305
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,519
that it's designed specifically
to withstand napalm.

306
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:19,920
That's where, uh, thermite plasma
comes in. General Peterson?

307
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:23,719
Thermite plasma incendiary systems
can burn hot enough to consume V.X....

308
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:27,239
but they're still in the test phase;
it's not operational.

309
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:31,599
Hummel knows this. We are dealing with
one smart son of a bitch.

310
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,317
What's it gonna take to equip a flight
of F-18s with thermite plasma...

311
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,999
within the next 36 hours?

312
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:40,519
- An act of God.
- Excuse me?

313
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,317
All right, we can try.

314
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,880
But I strongly urge you to consider the
use of this as a secondary initiative.

315
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,119
Then we have to go to our
primary initiative. Uh, Admiral?

316
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,557
Sir, I'd like to bring in our SEAL
ground commander, Commander Anderson.

317
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,160
Mr. Womack, who is
your best chemical/biological man?

318
00:23:57,317 --> 00:24:01,200
- Oh, that's interesting.
- Oh, yeah.
- That's very compelling.

319
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,599
- You like my pigtails?
- Oh, yeah, the pigtails
are very naughty.

320
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,440
Naughty. Naughty.

321
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,719
Just the Amaretto cream
with peach sorbet persuasion.

322
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:20,160
- This isn't happening.
- No, Stan, don't answer it.

323
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,119
- This isn't happening!
- No, just don't answer it. It's okay.

324
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,880
- I have to. It's the office,
baby. They know I'm home.
- No.

325
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,519
How could they possibly know
that you're home?

326
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,719
It's the FBl.

327
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:34,640
Stanley!

328
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:37,278
Goodspeed.
Uh, yeah. O-Okay, yeah.

329
00:24:37,317 --> 00:24:39,640
I'll be, I'll be down, yeah,
downstairs in ten minutes.

330
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,317
No, you won't.

331
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,680
- I have to go to San Francisco.
- No, you don't.

332
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,759
Stanley, no, you do not have
to go to San Francisco.

333
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:53,839
Are you kidding me right now?
You need to stay here
and talk to me about things.

334
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,359
-I've got to go, baby.
-Oh! I am Catholic! Do you realize that?

335
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,519
I am pregnant and I am unmarried. And
this causes a serious problem for me.

336
00:25:01,557 --> 00:25:03,479
I cannot believe you.

337
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,959
No, no.

338
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:19,239
I love you.
I will marry you.

339
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,920
I just didn't plan on this, that's all.

340
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:25,880
- Come to San Francisco.
- Really?

341
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,839
Yeah, I'm sure it's just
a training exercise.

342
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,160
Check into the hotel.
Order up some champagne.

343
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,160
- And we'll finish what we started?
- Exactly.

344
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,920
- Baby, you're gonna marry me?
- You know it.

345
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,557
You're gonna marry me!

346
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,317
- Oh, honey, come on.
Just a really quick one.
- Oh, oh, I gotta go now.

347
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,359
A nighttime airdrop incursion
is out due to the full moon.

348
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,278
Likewise a frontal
seaside attack.

349
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:48,519
If we're compromised and shots
are fired, Hummel might launch.

350
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:51,160
Our only alternative
is an attack from within the prison.

351
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:54,640
We penetrate the island
through the tunnels under the
prison buildings undetected...

352
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,557
and emerge in its center; that way
we can jump the marines from behind.

353
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,239
And if we're lucky, take their
rocket positions without a shot fired.

354
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:03,680
I don't understand. You-you've studied
the architectural plans?

355
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,557
They're useless. Alcatraz has been
ripped up and rebuilt for years.

356
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,479
- Under there is a maze of shit.
- Well, there's no question, gentlemen.

357
00:26:10,557 --> 00:26:12,959
We need firsthand intelligence
of the tunnel systems.

358
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,317
- So what about the former warden?
- Died in 1979.

359
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:18,400
All the guards we contacted
were useless.

360
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:23,278
Um, there is someone
who I think can help us.

361
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,359
- This is for the sake
of national security.
- No!

362
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,999
It's the sake of national
security that got us here
in the first place 33 years ago.

363
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:34,798
I knew! I knew someday
this would come back to bite us.

364
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:37,640
Forget it!
He does not exist.

365
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:41,038
He does exist! We just chose
to forget him for 30 years.

366
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,160
- We locked him up
and threw away the key.
- Oh, and a lot of goddamn good
it did us.

367
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:47,839
He broke out of two maximum-security
prisons. And if he hits the streets--

368
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,160
He's not gonna hit the streets, Jim.

369
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,119
Thirty years ago he was
a highly-trained SAS operative.

370
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,920
He is my age now,
for Christ's sake!

371
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:57,798
I have to get up three times
a night to take a piss.

372
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:00,880
We can't risk
letting him out.

373
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:04,479
He's a professional
escape artist.

374
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:39,440
- Gosh. Neat, uh--
- Yeah.
- Neat, neat plane.

375
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:41,359
Dr. Goodspeed.
James Womack.

376
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,999
- A pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

377
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,880
You come very highly recommended.

378
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,278
B.A. Columbia;
M.A., PhD, Johns Hopkins.

379
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:50,359
Biochemistry, toxicology.

380
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,920
Well, I'm one of those fortunate
people who like my job, sir.

381
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:55,719
Got my first chemistry set when I
was seven. Blew my eyebrows off.

382
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,599
We never saw the cat again.
Been into it ever since.

383
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,400
What do you know about V.X. gas?

384
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:03,719
Liquid. Failed pesticide
discovered by a mistake in 1952.

385
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:05,239
Uh, actually, it's kind of like
champagne that way.

386
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:06,920
The Franciscan monks thought
they were making white wine.

387
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:08,880
Somehow the bottle carbonated.
Voila! Champagne.

388
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:11,479
- And then the whole thing just--
- The gas, Dr. Goodspeed.

389
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,680
It's very, very horrible, sir.

390
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,079
It's one of those things
we wish we could disinvent.

391
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:19,519
This isn't a "train" exercise, is it?

392
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,839
No, Dr. Goodspeed,
it's not a training exercise.

393
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:01,359
- Hello, sir.
- Good morning, Director.

394
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,119
This is Ernest Paxton, agent in charge
of the West Coast operation.

395
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,200
- Dr. Goodspeed.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do, sir?

396
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,557
It's been a fairly interesting day
so far. The prisoner's here. Shall we?

397
00:29:11,557 --> 00:29:15,440
Now, my boys, they haven't been
able to find a file on this guy.
Who is he anyway, sir?

398
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,239
His name is John Mason,
a British national...

399
00:29:18,317 --> 00:29:23,160
incarcerated on Alcatraz
in 1962, escaped in '63.

400
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,759
I was under the impression that no one
ever escaped Alcatraz, sir.

401
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:27,999
Paxton, don't argue!

402
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,038
This man has no identity, not in
the United States or Great Britain.

403
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:34,599
He does not exist. Understand?

404
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,839
I want one thing:
how he escaped The Rock.

405
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,839
Specifically the route he took
through the island's bowels.

406
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,239
- The papers are in order, sir.
- We're prepared to offer him
a full pardon.

407
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:47,759
And Paxton, no strong-arming Mason.
I know him too well.

408
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:50,079
Well, if you know him,
then why don't you question him?

409
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,680
No, he'll remember me. I don't want
his anger clouding the issue.

410
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:56,160
All right, I'll take care of him.

411
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:08,239
Mr. Mason, I'm Special Agent
in Charge, Ernest Paxton.

412
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:12,440
In charge of what? Fucking me over
for another three decades?

413
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:15,359
I don't know anything about your
previous matters. I'm here because...

414
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,719
a special situation exists that we feel
you might be able to help us with.

415
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:20,640
Well, what might that be?

416
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:24,839
I've been in jail longer than
Nelson Mandela, so maybe you
want me to run for president.

417
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,119
- Not exactly.
- Mmm, a pity.

418
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,119
I feel rather like Alcamenes.

419
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,400
- Who?
- Alcamenes. He was imprisoned
by his king in ancient Greece.

420
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:38,557
-Like Sir Walter Raleigh. The same fate.
-James the First.

421
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,038
Even someone as bright as you
must be aware that, uh,

422
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:44,400
there's a certain pattern
emerging here.

423
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:46,359
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn?

424
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,719
Yeah, I heard of him. Didn't he play
hockey for the fuckin' Red Wings?

425
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:52,759
- That's the chap.
- Get this straight, pops.

426
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:55,519
I don't like you any more
than you like me.

427
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:57,880
But I'm here to make you
a legitimate offer.

428
00:30:57,959 --> 00:31:00,119
You wanna hear what
I have to say or not?

429
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,680
By all means, dear Paxton.
By all means.

430
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:06,999
We got a problem in a place
that I think you know.

431
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:09,759
There's a hostage situation
on Alcatraz.

432
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:13,239
- Hostage?
- Eighty-one tourists.

433
00:31:13,317 --> 00:31:16,640
The Rock has become
a tourist attraction?

434
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:19,519
Why don't we cut the shit, huh?
You know The Rock.

435
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:22,839
- You broke out.
- Yes, successfully.

436
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,759
Yeah. So why don't you do yourself
a favor while you're helpin' us?

437
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:28,640
I mean, it'd be nice to get out of jail
while you're still vertical.

438
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:31,798
Hmm? While you got a little lead
left in your pencil.

439
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:36,079
While I'm considering your offer...

440
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,200
I want a suite
in the Fairmont Hotel.

441
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:43,880
You know I'm here
to cut you a deal.

442
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:47,959
I am not here to bend over
and take it up the ass from you.

443
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:50,599
Here. Here's a quarter.

444
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:59,278
Do yourself a favor. Call your lawyer.
You're goin' back to jail.

445
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,119
- Y-You're sending him back to jail?
- I'm not sending him anywhere.

446
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,400
I'm just givin' him
somethin' to think about.

447
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:09,200
With all due respect, sir,
I don't think we have time...

448
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:10,557
for him to just sit around
and think about it.

449
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:13,759
- Oh, really?
- No, Goodspeed's right.

450
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,959
- You go talk to him.
- Me?
- Yes.

451
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:18,479
- Sir, I'm not qualified for that.
- You're an FBI agent!

452
00:32:18,557 --> 00:32:20,599
- W-What is your specialty again?
- Chemical weapons.

453
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,317
Don't mention that!

454
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:29,160
- You want me to lie?
- Yeah, lie.

455
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:33,759
We got less than 24 hours.
Give it a shot.

456
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:37,160
Okay.

457
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,160
Hi.

458
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,079
I'm an agent with the, uh,
uh, F-Federal--

459
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,920
FBl. Uh--

460
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:54,557
- Eh, well, my-- I'm Stanley Goodspeed.
- But of course you are.

461
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,079
Well, at least
he got his name right.

462
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,759
- Of course I am. Huh.
- And you have an emergency.

463
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:04,079
That's right.

464
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,317
And you need my help.

465
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,278
Exactly right.

466
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:12,640
- Coffee.
- No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

467
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:15,557
Offer me coffee.

468
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,239
Oh, yes! Well, that was,
in fact, gonna be my next--

469
00:33:18,317 --> 00:33:20,959
Can we get a cup of coffee
in here, please?

470
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:23,798
And offer to take these off.

471
00:33:24,557 --> 00:33:26,079
Mr. Mason, really.

472
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,719
- All kidding aside.
- As a gesture of your good faith.

473
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:35,999
- Prisoner requests to have
his handcuffs taken off.
- No, no, no, no.

474
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,317
Why don't you go ahead and have
his handcuffs taken off, please?

475
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:42,999
Well, I guess
that's one way to go.

476
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,959
This is a pardon and release contract
from the Attorney General's office.

477
00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:52,920
Now, it makes you a free man
provided you cooperate.

478
00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:56,239
So if you'll just, uh, sign...

479
00:33:56,278 --> 00:33:58,200
uh, at, uh, where it says--

480
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:01,439
- "Signature"?
- That's-- Yes. "Signature."

481
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,278
Well, timeo danaos et dona ferentis.

482
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:09,277
"l fear the Greeks
even when they bring gifts."

483
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:11,878
Oh, an educated man!

484
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,838
That rules out the possibility
of you being a field agent.

485
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:19,679
In point of fact,
I am a field agent, Mr. Mason.

486
00:34:19,717 --> 00:34:22,000
- Really?
- Yes.

487
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:25,599
- In which field?
- Antiterrorism.

488
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,599
Then you're trained in weaponry,
explosives and mortal combat.

489
00:34:30,717 --> 00:34:33,438
Well-trained.

490
00:34:33,518 --> 00:34:36,358
Then it's the Fairmont Hotel.

491
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:39,759
Okay.

492
00:34:39,797 --> 00:34:43,599
I want a suite,
a shower, a shave...

493
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,480
and the feel of a suit.

494
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:48,639
May I also suggest, uh, a haircut?

495
00:34:48,717 --> 00:34:52,838
- Am I out of style?
- Unless you're a 20-year-old
guitarist from Seattle.

496
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:55,079
- It's a grunge thing.
- Grunge?

497
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,039
Yeah, well, uh, uh--
Okay, thank you very much.

498
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:02,599
All right. Call the Fairmont.
Close the floor if necessary,
but I want him sealed off.

499
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:05,559
And he gets two hours max.

500
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,797
-Great job, Goodspeed.
-Why didn't you throw in a trip
to Tahiti while you were at it?

501
00:35:22,878 --> 00:35:26,199
- I'll deliver this
to the Attorney General.
- Uh, no, you'll give it to me.
Give it to me, Reynolds.

502
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:30,878
And take Attorney Reynolds
outside. There's a car
waiting for you. Thank you.

503
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,559
That's a signed federal document, sir.
Isn't that illegal?

504
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:39,079
You're not acquainted
with the full facts, Goodspeed.

505
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:43,358
With all due respect, sir, I'd like
clarification. I gave that man my word.

506
00:35:43,438 --> 00:35:48,599
Damn it! You're on a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

507
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:51,518
It's, uh, it's, eh,
kind of curious, but, uh,

508
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,838
Sir Walter Raleigh,
Alcamenes, Solzhenitsyn,

509
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,679
they, um, well, they were all
wrongfully imprisoned.

510
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:10,199
Womack! Now, why am I not surprised,
you piece of shit!

511
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:12,480
Eh, peace! Peace!

512
00:36:19,717 --> 00:36:21,918
Hey, we're not home.
Leave a message.

513
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,079
Hi, darling, it's, uh, it's me.

514
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:27,079
Uh, listen, don't come
to San Francisco.

515
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,559
I repeat, do not come
to San Francisco.

516
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:31,119
- Stanley, no!
- Carla.
- Wha--

517
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,639
- Carla.
- Like hell I'm not coming!

518
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:35,039
Wait. Car--

519
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,000
Who's Carla? And why don't you
want her to come to San Francisco?

520
00:36:48,398 --> 00:36:51,679
You're on a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

521
00:36:51,717 --> 00:36:54,599
Watch it, he'll bite you.

522
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:05,039
Good. Mobile Command
is fully operational.

523
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:05,838
Good. Mobile Command
is fully operational.

524
00:37:05,918 --> 00:37:09,277
- We'll be there in
approximately two hours.
- I'm not armed, sir.
- Right.

525
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:12,039
- I am unarmed, sir.
- Well, where's your issue?

526
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:16,119
I left it in my,
uh, my sock drawer.

527
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:19,000
A gun?

528
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:22,599
For what?
You're a chemical freak.

529
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:27,000
No, I'm a chemical super-freak,
actually. But I still need a gun.

530
00:37:27,918 --> 00:37:30,159
Give him a goddamn gun.

531
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Have you fired one of
those things since the Academy?

532
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:39,039
- Wear some flowers in your hair
- If you're going to San Francisco

533
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:41,679
Don't forget to wear
flowers in your hair

534
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,159
- If you're going
- If you're going

535
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:48,639
- To San Francisco
- To San Francisco

536
00:37:48,717 --> 00:37:52,119
- You're sure to meet
some gentle people there
- You're gonna meet

537
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:57,679
- Some gentle people there
- And you come for--

538
00:37:57,759 --> 00:38:00,518
If you're going
to San Francisco

539
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:02,960
Uh, uh, room service?

540
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,277
Ah, listen. This is the penthouse.
Do you do snacks, drinks? Huh?

541
00:38:07,398 --> 00:38:09,480
Hello!

542
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,797
- You the barber?
- No. Stylist.

543
00:38:11,878 --> 00:38:14,318
Barber.

544
00:38:14,398 --> 00:38:18,119
- Just clippers. No scissors.
- No scissors? You've got to be
kidding me, no scissors!

545
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:20,398
I mean, did they tell Picasso,
"No brush"?

546
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,277
With scissors,
this man could kill you.

547
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:26,918
I can't cut anyone's balls off
with a trimmer now, can l?

548
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,960
Why don't we do this outside?
Get some sun.

549
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:36,079
Oh, who did this to you? This is
just not right. In fact, it's nasty!

550
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:38,079
Well, it's a grunge thing.

551
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:40,079
Well, it's some kind of thing.

552
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:42,918
Do you think we have time for a sea kelp
protein pack and maybe some color?

553
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,199
No.

554
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:48,960
Okay. Not very nice, is he?

555
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:50,960
No, he's not.

556
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,239
'Cause I'm leavin'

557
00:39:07,277 --> 00:39:09,599
Hey, somebody ordered it.
Can't let it go to waste.

558
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:12,679
- Don't know when I'll be back again
- Don't you ever stop eatin'?

559
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:14,838
Not when it's free.

560
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:18,039
- We're supposed to be on duty.
- Hey, don't worry. He's an old man.

561
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,960
The boss is watchin' 'im. Come on.
Have-- Try some of this lobster.

562
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,159
-Mm-hmm.
-My secretary here will settle the bill.

563
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:28,480
So what do you have in store for me,
Womack, when this is over?

564
00:39:28,518 --> 00:39:31,277
You'll get your life back, Mason.

565
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:34,079
But you could've given me
my life back years ago.

566
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:42,639
- Why should I trust you now?
- You've got my word.

567
00:39:42,717 --> 00:39:45,717
Will you shake on it?

568
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:59,000
- Freeze, mister!
- Oh, man!

569
00:39:59,918 --> 00:40:01,679
Help!

570
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:04,518
Drop the gun,
or I drop your boss.

571
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:07,679
You will not!

572
00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:09,559
Get!

573
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:12,159
- He's getting very heavy.
- Then pull him up.

574
00:40:16,438 --> 00:40:19,277
Please don't!

575
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:22,039
Help! Shit!

576
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,759
Come on. Have a scallop.
Come on. Catch.

577
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,639
You hoist him!

578
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:36,599
Help! Help! Help!

579
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:38,797
- Where's Mason? Where is Mason?
- Help! Hang on!

580
00:40:38,878 --> 00:40:42,000
- Where's Mason?
- Mason's gone!
- Gone?

581
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:46,159
Clear.

582
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:48,717
Living room's clear!

583
00:40:48,797 --> 00:40:52,000
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

584
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:54,838
All units, this is Caretaker.
We have a Signal Six. He's in the hotel!

585
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,079
Okay, I don't wanna know
nothin'. I never saw you throw
that gentleman off the balcony.

586
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:09,159
All I care about is, a-are
you happy with your haircut?

587
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,878
Easy!

588
00:41:13,277 --> 00:41:16,759
Watch it, you fuckhead,
you're gonna pull my arm out!

589
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,358
Watch out!

590
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:26,759
Oh, no!

591
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,559
Watch it!

592
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:42,079
- Hey, watch it!
- He's over there!

593
00:41:57,797 --> 00:41:59,717
Hey!

594
00:41:59,797 --> 00:42:05,119
This is my Humvee. I don't want
any dings, dents or scratches,
or I'll have your ass. Hey!

595
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:06,797
Hey! Stop! Hey!

596
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,838
Hey, I was inside the bedroom
with Jack Powell!

597
00:42:13,918 --> 00:42:15,559
Hey, call the guard! Go!

598
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,559
FBl.

599
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:32,398
Move!

600
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:41,398
Whoa! Whoa!

601
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,878
Suspect is in a black Humvee,
heading west on California.

602
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,000
Speed approximately
70 miles per hour.

603
00:42:53,797 --> 00:42:57,239
Get out of the way!

604
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,599
I want a net put on this
son of a bitch, you hear me?

605
00:43:33,318 --> 00:43:36,159
This guy's hittin' every fuckin' thing
in sight tryin' to block us!

606
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:15,480
I hope you're insured!

607
00:44:23,717 --> 00:44:25,838
Oh, well, why not?

608
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:43,318
You're goin' down!

609
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,599
Hello?

610
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm only borrowing your Humvee!

611
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:17,438
Information? San Francisco?

612
00:45:17,518 --> 00:45:20,559
Uh, Jade Angelou.
That's A-N-G--

613
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,878
Welcome aboard, y'all.
How y'all doin' today?

614
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:30,239
Hang on!

615
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,480
Holy shit!

616
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,039
Whoa-oa!

617
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:51,480
Oh, no!

618
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:57,438
We're gonna crash!
Save yourselves!

619
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:04,838
Oh, my baby!

620
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,358
Oh, no!

621
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:26,039
Oh, no.

622
00:46:29,717 --> 00:46:31,599
Oh, God!

623
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,277
Oh, God!

624
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:55,759
Hey, man, you just fucked up
your Ferrari.

625
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:59,599
- Oh, no! Baby's goin' down in flames!
- It's not mine.

626
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:01,239
Neither is this!

627
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:08,478
Damn! This sucks!
Where's that son of a bitch at?

628
00:47:08,518 --> 00:47:12,119
I'm gonna hunt him down!
That motherfucker ain't safe nowhere.

629
00:47:13,878 --> 00:47:18,119
- Chem weapons. Isherwood.
- Marvin, look up Wolfburg
Federal Penitentiary.

630
00:47:18,197 --> 00:47:20,119
The inmate is Mason, John.

631
00:47:20,197 --> 00:47:23,039
Hey, Stan, listen, I'm gettin'
out of this government shithole.

632
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,958
I'm goin' over to Orkin to
design roach motels. Cool, huh?

633
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:27,518
Look, I just stole
a kid's motorcycle.

634
00:47:27,597 --> 00:47:29,998
I'm not really feeling too good
about it, okay? Wolfburg. Got it?

635
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,318
Yeah, I got it. All right,
Magrane, Masconi, Masters. No Mason.

636
00:47:34,398 --> 00:47:38,998
Go to February '76. Who was transferred
to Wolfburg from San Quentin?

637
00:47:40,597 --> 00:47:42,719
This is weird.
They got medical records.

638
00:47:42,797 --> 00:47:47,958
They got place of birth. Glasgow.
Uh, but they don't have a name.

639
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:49,637
Uh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
They have next of kin.

640
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:53,797
A Jade Angelou
of 32 Stenson Drive, San Francisco.

641
00:48:12,717 --> 00:48:14,358
Jade?

642
00:48:14,438 --> 00:48:17,998
No, Stacy. Jade's friend.

643
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,318
Were you afraid
to come alone?

644
00:48:25,398 --> 00:48:27,277
Yeah.

645
00:48:28,918 --> 00:48:31,958
- It's okay.
- I'll be over here if you need me.

646
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:36,039
The last photograph I had of you,
you were about ten.

647
00:48:36,077 --> 00:48:37,918
Yeah?

648
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:42,838
Well, I found a picture of you
among my mom's things when she died.

649
00:48:44,157 --> 00:48:48,998
Oh, yeah? Well, uh--
Why don't we take a walk?

650
00:48:49,077 --> 00:48:51,878
I got 'im.
Palace of Fine Arts.

651
00:48:51,918 --> 00:48:55,918
Your mother, uh-- Yeah, well,
sh-she was very special.

652
00:48:55,998 --> 00:48:58,239
Yeah, she was.

653
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:02,277
But I don't think that we
should romanticize what happened
between you and her.

654
00:49:02,358 --> 00:49:05,157
Meeting in a bar
after a Led Zeppelin concert.

655
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:07,878
Head out, and I was the result.

656
00:49:07,918 --> 00:49:10,717
Well, I'd like to think it
would've led somewhere if only--

657
00:49:10,797 --> 00:49:13,878
If only what? Six federal marshals
hadn't kicked down our door...

658
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:16,398
and dragged you back to prison?

659
00:49:17,478 --> 00:49:20,358
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

660
00:49:21,556 --> 00:49:25,478
- So, they let you out?
- Yeah.

661
00:49:25,556 --> 00:49:27,478
That's good.

662
00:49:29,398 --> 00:49:31,918
What did you do?

663
00:49:31,998 --> 00:49:33,679
J--

664
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:41,878
Jade, I don't have
a great deal of time here.

665
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:44,597
But I'll be coming back.
And, uh--

666
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:48,199
- Maybe we can--
- What? We can what?

667
00:49:49,639 --> 00:49:53,998
You know, you're almost
the only evidence...

668
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,398
that I exist.

669
00:49:56,478 --> 00:49:58,277
But I don't know you.

670
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:00,358
That's what I want to change, eh?

671
00:50:05,157 --> 00:50:09,079
I've rehearsed this speech a thousand
times on the chance that we would meet.

672
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,918
Here we are, and I'm lost.

673
00:50:11,998 --> 00:50:14,757
Well, I don't know how
I'm supposed to be feeling either.

674
00:50:15,556 --> 00:50:18,679
Jade, I'm not an evil man.

675
00:50:18,757 --> 00:50:21,797
If you can believe that,
then it's a start.

676
00:50:25,478 --> 00:50:27,157
Okay.

677
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:40,038
Is this about you?

678
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:56,518
You broke out of prison again,
didn't you? Why did you come to me?

679
00:50:56,597 --> 00:51:00,239
FBl, ma'am.
Your father's working with us.

680
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:02,277
He's helping us resolve
a dangerous situation.

681
00:51:02,358 --> 00:51:04,639
- He is?
- Yes, ma'am.

682
00:51:04,717 --> 00:51:07,559
Well, gee whiz, John,
I guess we oughta get goin', huh?

683
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:10,038
Whatever you say, Stanley.

684
00:51:15,998 --> 00:51:18,398
Thank you for that.
You could've handled it differently.

685
00:51:18,438 --> 00:51:21,518
What do you say we cut
the chitchat, a-hole?

686
00:51:21,597 --> 00:51:25,478
You almost got me killed twice.
And my jaw hurts like hell!

687
00:51:26,518 --> 00:51:28,358
- Good.
- Cocksucker!

688
00:51:28,398 --> 00:51:31,117
If I had my way, you would be shipped
back to Wolfburg in leg irons...

689
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,518
and caged like an animal for the rest
of your natural fucking life!

690
00:51:34,597 --> 00:51:37,559
You wrecked half the city!

691
00:51:40,878 --> 00:51:42,958
Now, tell me about the tunnels.

692
00:51:43,038 --> 00:51:48,079
If you know the system, it will
take you wherever you need to go.

693
00:51:48,157 --> 00:51:52,117
All right, there's an intake pipe here,
below low tide. Is that our best access?

694
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:54,398
Yes. That's exactly
where I had come out.

695
00:51:54,438 --> 00:51:56,478
Then beneath the cistern,
there's a connection
to the abandoned septic system.

696
00:51:56,478 --> 00:51:57,797
Then beneath the cistern,
there's a connection
to the abandoned septic system.

697
00:51:57,878 --> 00:51:59,478
How many feet is that?

698
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:02,639
Uh, 57 paces.

699
00:52:02,677 --> 00:52:04,717
Where do we go from there?

700
00:52:07,398 --> 00:52:10,559
Where do we go from there?

701
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:12,998
That's a good question.

702
00:52:14,358 --> 00:52:17,677
- I have no idea.
- What?

703
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:20,878
I mean, I'll know it
when we're all inside.

704
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:24,237
No. You're not goddamn goin'.
Show us on the blueprints.

705
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:28,478
I can't! My blueprint
was in my head.

706
00:52:28,518 --> 00:52:31,717
I was underground
for three days in the dark...

707
00:52:31,797 --> 00:52:34,318
just waiting for the tides
to be right.

708
00:52:34,398 --> 00:52:37,717
But don't worry.
It'll all come back to me.

709
00:52:37,797 --> 00:52:40,277
You're not going anywhere, Mason.

710
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:45,438
Wait a second. Now, this piece
of work might be the only chance
those people over there have.

711
00:52:45,518 --> 00:52:47,998
If he's not going, then why the
hell did we get him out of jail?

712
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,398
- He's smart.
- I got him out to get you
people in, not go with you.

713
00:52:51,478 --> 00:52:55,478
If it's the only way of getting
the intelligence I need, then he goes.

714
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:57,237
He'll fuck with you.

715
00:52:57,318 --> 00:53:00,958
You compromise my men's lives,
and I'll bury you out there.

716
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:04,878
Now, Womack...

717
00:53:04,958 --> 00:53:07,518
you're between The Rock
and a hard case.

718
00:53:10,237 --> 00:53:12,878
How is your bowling arm?

719
00:53:14,237 --> 00:53:16,478
Dr. Goodspeed, the goal is
to take out the launchers,

720
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,478
then neutralize
the V.X. chemical rounds.

721
00:53:18,518 --> 00:53:21,958
Well, we know the poison's being
kept in the prison morgue from
the satellite thermal imaging...

722
00:53:22,038 --> 00:53:24,639
which is right here;
these colorized dots.

723
00:53:24,717 --> 00:53:28,838
-Have you ever actually seen
one of these devices?
-No, sir, but I've studied them.

724
00:53:28,878 --> 00:53:32,199
I should really begin briefing your guys
on defusing and detoxification.

725
00:53:32,277 --> 00:53:34,838
Got a really neat layout over here of
the chem round as well as the rocket...

726
00:53:34,918 --> 00:53:37,677
- so let's get rolling.
- That won't be necessary.

727
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,597
Oh, it's very necessary, sir.

728
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:45,838
The power of this chemical
is way beyond anything you can imagine.

729
00:53:45,878 --> 00:53:47,559
An ecological disaster, sir.

730
00:53:47,597 --> 00:53:49,958
Plus the devices themselves
are complicated.

731
00:53:50,038 --> 00:53:51,438
That's why you're
coming with us.

732
00:53:55,478 --> 00:53:59,199
-I am?
-You're the expert. What's your problem?

733
00:53:59,237 --> 00:54:03,759
You mean I'm going, going out there,
under the water?

734
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:05,998
Well, earlier today
you wanted a gun.

735
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,237
Now you're getting a gun
and a wet suit.

736
00:54:08,277 --> 00:54:10,918
Have you ever been
in a combat situation?

737
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:13,398
- Define "combat," sir.
- Shep?

738
00:54:13,478 --> 00:54:16,838
An incursion underwater to
retake an impregnable fortress
held by an elite team...

739
00:54:16,918 --> 00:54:19,998
of U.S. Marines in possession
of 81 hostages and 15 guided rockets...

740
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:23,038
armed with V.X. poisoned gas.

741
00:54:23,117 --> 00:54:26,759
Oh. In that case, no, sir.
Excuse me.

742
00:54:32,918 --> 00:54:34,759
- Here.
- Ah, thank you.

743
00:54:37,398 --> 00:54:39,878
You don't look too good.

744
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:42,559
In fact, you look like shit.

745
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:45,759
My stomach's doing hula hoops
around my ass.

746
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:49,079
You all right?

747
00:54:49,157 --> 00:54:51,237
I mean, you gonna make it
through this thing?

748
00:54:51,277 --> 00:54:53,277
I don't know.

749
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:55,717
I always expected something
like this was going to happen...

750
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:58,478
but nothing prepares you for it.

751
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,797
Now I'm--
I'm responsible...

752
00:55:00,878 --> 00:55:02,759
for a whole city.

753
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,358
Look, I know this
isn't easy for you.

754
00:55:07,438 --> 00:55:09,639
Remember, you were trained
for this kind of a situation...

755
00:55:09,717 --> 00:55:11,639
and believe me,
it'll come back to you.

756
00:55:11,717 --> 00:55:14,998
Besides, you got the best SEAL team
in the country backing you up.

757
00:55:15,038 --> 00:55:18,677
Okay. You're right.

758
00:55:18,717 --> 00:55:22,199
I-l'll be on the wire.
I'll help talk you through it.

759
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,998
There's something else.

760
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:28,518
It's terrible.
N-No, it's wonderful...

761
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,918
except it isn't.

762
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:34,159
My girlfriend's pregnant...

763
00:55:34,237 --> 00:55:37,998
and she's just flown in to see me.

764
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:40,717
You keep your mind on what you're going
to be doing out there tonight.

765
00:55:40,757 --> 00:55:44,679
And I'll send someone to pick up
your girlfriend and bring her
here to the command center.

766
00:55:55,878 --> 00:55:59,597
Hummel!
- Hello, Frank. Lou Linstrom.

767
00:55:59,637 --> 00:56:03,237
I'm at the White House
with General Kramer.

768
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:07,117
Uh, Frank, uh, we're havin' a few
problems with the account transfer.

769
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:10,597
- Don't tell me problems.
Tell me solutions.
- Now, we've spoken to the president...

770
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:12,878
and I know that you're
well aware of his stance on terrorism.

771
00:56:12,918 --> 00:56:17,998
- So what we'd like to do is--
- This isn't about terrorism.
This is about justice.

772
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,597
It's about reminding you people
who found it politically
convenient to forget.

773
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:22,958
This is goin' nowhere, Frank.

774
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,679
Well, then, let me tell you what is.

775
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:27,159
Fifteen V.X. gas rockets
into the heart of San Francisco.

776
00:56:27,237 --> 00:56:29,478
You've got 17 hours
to deliver the money.

777
00:56:29,518 --> 00:56:32,159
Or be prepared to reap
the whirlwind, gentlemen.

778
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:39,717
- What's the word from Mojave?
- General Peterson can give us...

779
00:56:39,757 --> 00:56:42,757
no definite assurance
on the thermite plasma.

780
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:44,878
That is the word.

781
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:51,199
Green light to SEAL incursion.

782
00:57:08,597 --> 00:57:11,918
Fall in! All right, listen up.

783
00:57:11,998 --> 00:57:14,039
Mr. Mason will run point for us.

784
00:57:14,117 --> 00:57:16,039
Lieutenant Shepard
will be attached to his hip.

785
00:57:16,117 --> 00:57:19,958
You breathe, he breathes with you.
You piss, he helps.

786
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:22,079
Understood?

787
00:57:22,117 --> 00:57:24,237
Dr. Goodspeed is our specialist.

788
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:28,918
When he neutralizes the threat,
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

789
00:57:28,998 --> 00:57:32,878
Make no mistake, gentlemen.
We're in the fight of our lives...

790
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:35,797
against maybe the greatest
battalion commander in the Vietnam War.

791
00:57:35,878 --> 00:57:37,998
I shit you not.

792
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,918
Any questions?

793
00:57:41,277 --> 00:57:43,518
Let's load up!

794
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:53,679
After you, ace.

795
00:58:13,878 --> 00:58:16,597
Pass out and activate
the minicams.

796
00:58:18,998 --> 00:58:22,757
Everything set here?
Minicams operational?

797
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:26,079
Roger that, sir.
We are on-line.

798
00:58:29,637 --> 00:58:34,478
Shep, what's the status on the special
operational gear for Mr. Mason?

799
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:39,518
Uh, let's see.
We have, uh...

800
00:58:39,597 --> 00:58:42,277
one quart of kerosene
in a squeeze bottle.

801
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:49,838
Three washers and waterproof matches.

802
00:58:49,878 --> 00:58:53,117
Use the green flares to signal
when the threat has been neutralized.

803
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:55,478
Now, this is atropine.
If you come in contact with the gas...

804
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:57,679
you have 20 seconds
to inject it into your heart.

805
00:58:57,757 --> 00:59:00,958
Don't fuck with me on this.
It may save your life.

806
00:59:04,358 --> 00:59:07,358
I have three incoming bogeys
bearing 275.

807
00:59:07,438 --> 00:59:09,757
Range: 6,000 meters.

808
00:59:12,998 --> 00:59:15,918
FBI Command Center?

809
00:59:15,998 --> 00:59:19,039
- Oh, I would just love for you
to tell me what is goin' on.
- Nope.

810
00:59:19,117 --> 00:59:22,679
Listen, Stanley Goodspeed
is my boyfriend.
Actually, he's, um, my fiance.

811
00:59:22,757 --> 00:59:24,637
- Where is he?
- Classified, lady.

812
00:59:24,679 --> 00:59:27,559
Okay. Well, you just sit here
and act like a Bureau bonehead, then.

813
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:29,717
Hey, where are you g--
Goddamn it!

814
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,039
Decoy choppers
commencing run to Alcatraz.

815
00:59:38,717 --> 00:59:40,757
I just lost one, sir.
I just lost one.

816
00:59:40,838 --> 00:59:44,679
- We only got two flying in.
I just lost one.
- Shit!

817
00:59:53,878 --> 00:59:57,398
In my day, we did it all
with a snorkel and a pair of flippers.

818
00:59:57,478 --> 01:00:00,679
- Your day?
- Yes. Didn't you read my resume?

819
01:00:00,757 --> 01:00:03,717
I don't--
I don't know anything about you.

820
01:00:03,797 --> 01:00:06,117
- Hmm. I know something
about you, Godspell.
- Goodspeed.

821
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:09,717
Goodspeed, Godspeed,
Godspell...

822
01:00:09,797 --> 01:00:12,438
you never went to
any antiterrorist school.

823
01:00:12,518 --> 01:00:15,318
So just make sure you don't
get us all fucking killed.

824
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:21,159
- We're goin' dark.
- Night vision!

825
01:00:22,717 --> 01:00:24,918
Raider One has dropped
below radar coverage...

826
01:00:24,998 --> 01:00:26,838
heading around
Treasure lsland.

827
01:00:28,679 --> 01:00:31,797
Sir, we've got two bogeys
bearing due east and closing.

828
01:00:36,918 --> 01:00:38,318
Decoys?

829
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:41,237
- Prepare to deploy!
- Good luck, Commander.

830
01:00:46,117 --> 01:00:47,998
Sir, Raider One
is at the drop zone.

831
01:00:50,277 --> 01:00:53,277
Stanley's not a very good swimmer.
I mean, he can't even snorkel.

832
01:00:54,757 --> 01:00:56,679
- Everyone, good to go?
- Good to go!

833
01:00:56,757 --> 01:01:00,358
- Good to go!
- Good to go! Good to go!

834
01:01:09,438 --> 01:01:12,117
All right, so the S.D.U.s
have been deployed,
and the Eagles are in the water.

835
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:23,838
Major, I want the perimeter patrolled
to the west end of the island.

836
01:01:23,878 --> 01:01:25,958
- Double-time it.
- Yes, sir. Hendrix!

837
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:27,998
- You lead the patrol.
- Aye, aye, sir.

838
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,039
Let's move. Move out!
Move out! Move out!

839
01:02:24,597 --> 01:02:27,998
The Eagles are on The Rock.
They've entered the cistern room.

840
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:36,159
Thank you very fucking much,
Mr. Mason.

841
01:02:36,237 --> 01:02:38,478
You've led us into a room
with no exit.

842
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:45,117
- Any ideas, Dillinger?
- Figure it out soon.
We're sitting ducks.

843
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:46,679
We're a little tight on time.

844
01:02:46,757 --> 01:02:49,878
You stand by the door
until I open it.

845
01:02:49,958 --> 01:02:53,079
I'd like to know how you plan
on accomplishing that?

846
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:56,237
Through here.

847
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:05,559
- You're shitting me.
- I memorized the timing.

848
01:03:05,637 --> 01:03:07,478
I just hope it hasn't been changed.

849
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:10,398
You catch one of those flame bursts,
you're a corpse.

850
01:03:10,478 --> 01:03:13,597
- Thank you.
- Commander, you said never
to leave his sight, but, uh--

851
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:15,637
Stand fast, Lieutenant.

852
01:03:16,518 --> 01:03:18,438
Have a nice day.

853
01:03:39,918 --> 01:03:43,559
- Where'd you dig up this guy?
- That's classified.

854
01:03:50,597 --> 01:03:53,438
Clear here, sir.
No motion sensors tripped.

855
01:03:53,478 --> 01:03:57,079
- Nothing.
- Well, tell 'em to stay out there.

856
01:03:57,157 --> 01:03:59,358
Sweep forward!

857
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:10,478
Looks like he fucked us, Commander.

858
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:13,559
I knew it.
That son of a bitch jumped ship.

859
01:04:18,797 --> 01:04:20,637
Welcome to The Rock.

860
01:04:35,197 --> 01:04:37,518
- Mason.
- That's a no-no.

861
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:41,239
That's the subway.
That'll drop you into the tunnels.

862
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:43,318
Do it!

863
01:04:59,117 --> 01:05:02,478
Sir, the Eagles have breached
the tunnel system.

864
01:05:08,518 --> 01:05:11,038
You enjoying this?

865
01:05:11,117 --> 01:05:14,077
Well, it's certainly more enjoyable
than my average day.

866
01:05:14,117 --> 01:05:18,398
Reading philosophy,
avoiding gang rape in the washroom.

867
01:05:18,438 --> 01:05:22,277
Though it's less of a problem these
days. Maybe I'm losing my sex appeal.

868
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,719
We've got seismic activity
in one of the storm grates. North side.

869
01:05:29,797 --> 01:05:32,478
Continue patrolling the area.

870
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,398
Sweep forward!

871
01:05:35,637 --> 01:05:37,719
Commander, halt.
We've got movement.
