Budapest.

00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,873
The next stop's Budapest.

4
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,875
Budapest is the next stop.

5
00:00:54,212 --> 00:00:56,211
Budapest.

6
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:57,914
Tickets, ladies.

7
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,783
Oop, here you go.

8
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:01,317
- Here's mine.
- And mine.

9
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:02,988
- Mine, too!
- Here you go!

10
00:01:05,324 --> 00:01:08,625
Thank you, young man.

11
00:01:08,627 --> 00:01:10,360
Man, I hate wearing disguises.

12
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,995
These heels are killing me.

13
00:01:12,997 --> 00:01:14,331
Okay, take it down a notch.

14
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,965
We don't want to alarm
the humans.

15
00:01:17,268 --> 00:01:19,703
Psst. Drac.

16
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:22,171
I'm about to <i>und</i> freak out!

17
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:24,009
You're a nice kitty.

18
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:26,643
I'm <i>und</i> kitty-cat.

19
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:28,581
Meow. Meow!

20
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,820
Oh, no,
not this clown again.

21
00:01:37,822 --> 00:01:40,223
Good evening, travelers.

22
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,792
I am Professor
Abraham Van Helsing.

23
00:01:43,794 --> 00:01:46,962
Yes. One of the Van Helsings.

24
00:01:46,964 --> 00:01:50,367
For centuries, my family
has protected humanity

25
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,935
from the evils of monsters.

26
00:01:52,937 --> 00:01:55,204
So you can believe me
when I tell you,

27
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:57,974
there are monsters
hiding amongst you!

28
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:01,010
But fear not,

29
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:04,848
for I am a professional,
and I know how to flush out

30
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,852
these beasts
and bring them into the light!

31
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:10,353
Fire bad!

32
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:37,315
Whoa!

33
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:44,220
Sorry, guys.

34
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:58,334
Finally! First I kill Dracula,

35
00:02:58,336 --> 00:03:01,336
and then
the rest of the monsters!

36
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:03,173
Why do you keep doing this?

37
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:06,109
Your dad, your grandfather,
your great-great-granny...

38
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:08,078
I defeated them all.

39
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,747
When will you Van Helsings ever
learn to let go of the hate?

40
00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:15,451
Never! Because you,
monster, are a...

41
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:17,287
Eh, squeak, squeak.

42
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:18,822
What? A mouse?

43
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,123
Ahhh!

44
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,394
You can't run from me,
Prince of Darkness!

45
00:03:24,396 --> 00:03:27,197
I will hunt you
for all eternity!

46
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:34,037
I swear I will never rest until
I destroy you...

47
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,138
And...

48
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,339
Every...

49
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,507
Other...

50
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,942
Monster... Ow!

51
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:40,509
If it's the last thing...

52
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,845
I...

53
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:42,846
Ever...

54
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,149
Do!

55
00:03:47,986 --> 00:03:50,152
Boy, that guy is annoying.

56
00:03:50,154 --> 00:03:52,254
Maybe one day
there will be a place

57
00:03:52,256 --> 00:03:55,057
where monsters can go
to get away from it all,

58
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:56,459
take a vacation.

59
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:59,194
Who knows,
maybe even get married.

60
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:00,832
Wouldn't that be something?

61
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:39,138
Hmm?

62
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:47,376
It's okay.

63
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:49,479
Oh, when is
this thing starting?

64
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:51,948
Aw, you made them cry,
Wayne.

65
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,517
All except this little one.
Coochie-coochie...

66
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,553
That's Sunny.
She doesn't cry.

67
00:04:57,988 --> 00:04:59,823
She bites.

68
00:04:59,825 --> 00:05:02,392
This is a very special moment, Carl.

69
00:05:02,394 --> 00:05:07,800
Any second, your beautiful bride is
going to walk right down the aisle.

70
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:11,600
Oh, no, Drac,
she's not coming.

71
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,369
Oh, don't worry.

72
00:05:13,371 --> 00:05:18,041
Mavis is with her. I'm sure
everything is under control.

73
00:05:18,043 --> 00:05:20,577
Mavey, is everything
under control?

74
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:23,345
Um, yep, just a slight case
of pre-wedding jitters.

75
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:28,052
Ahhh!

76
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,025
Yep, everything is
fine here.

77
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:39,229
Please try to relax, Lucy.

78
00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:41,130
I've taken care
of everything.

79
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,066
The wedding
is going to be perfect.

80
00:05:44,068 --> 00:05:45,467
It's not that.

81
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:48,570
Just, how do I know
I'm doing the right thing?

82
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,409
I know just how you feel.

83
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:56,612
The day I married Johnny was
the best day of my life,

84
00:05:56,614 --> 00:05:58,414
but I was so nervous.

85
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,316
Not as nervous
as I was.

86
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,119
And you should have seen my dad.
He was a mess.

87
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:05,955
I wouldn't get out
of my coffin that night.

88
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:07,957
But he knew
it was meant to be.

89
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,092
It doesn't matter
where you come from

90
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:11,660
or how different
you are.

91
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,296
A Zing only happens
once in your life,

92
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:15,931
and you have to
cherish it.

93
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:20,270
Aw.

94
00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:22,337
You're right! Thank you!

95
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:24,474
Okay.
All right. Okay.

96
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:26,378
Oh. Uh... Okay.

97
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:31,080
I do.

98
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,249
I do.

99
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:41,691
Do you hear that?

100
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,159
Yes. I thought we
locked him in his room.

101
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:44,327
We did!

102
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:46,496
Whoa! Whoa!

103
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:48,097
Hi, Mom. Hi, Papa.

104
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:49,398
- Dennis!
- Dennis!

105
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,301
Tinkles was crying,
so we let him out.

106
00:06:56,106 --> 00:06:57,176
Ahhh!

107
00:07:00,577 --> 00:07:02,447
Tinkles, sit!

108
00:07:09,688 --> 00:07:12,522
Ah. Whose idea was it
to let Dennis have a puppy?

109
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:15,424
Um... Yours?

110
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:17,963
Right.

111
00:07:18,596 --> 00:07:20,362
Poor Tinkles.

112
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:22,431
Dennis...

113
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:25,068
Look, honey,
I know you love Tinkles,

114
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,035
but we're not allowed
to bring our dogs...

115
00:07:27,037 --> 00:07:30,138
Uh... I mean, our pets everywhere.

116
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,140
Okay?

117
00:07:31,142 --> 00:07:32,508
Okay.

Ooh! Watch out now.

129
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:07,777
She got stitches
in all the right places.

130
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,114
Okay, there's no way that
is related to you, Frank.

131
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,782
No, she's
my right arm's cousin.

00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,621

- Ah! I see it now.

134
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,690
Frank wanted me to meet you.

135
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:24,229
We're arm cousins,
twice removed.

136
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:27,162
Of course.

137
00:08:27,164 --> 00:08:30,767
I'd recognize that bicep
anywhere.

138
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:33,468
He thought, since we're both
single, we might hit it off,

139
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,770
maybe go on a date?

140
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:36,405
"Date"? Oh!

141
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:38,743
Well, eh,
it's just that, eh...

142
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,312
Whoa!

143
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,348
The DJ booth
is a sacred space!

144
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,384
I love this song!

145
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,821
Don't you?

146
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,222
Dracula?

147
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:55,158
Oh, where'd he go?

148
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,092
Dracula?

149
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:02,298
What's the matter, Drac,
you didn't like her?

150
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,534
No offense, but you
can't be too picky.

151
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:06,568
You haven't had a date
in 100 years.

152
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,140
Look, guys, I appreciate your
concern, but it's not up to me.

153
00:09:11,142 --> 00:09:14,409
You only Zing once,
and I did.

154
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:16,344
Times have changed, buddy.

155
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:18,780
You can even find someone to
Zing with on your phone now.

156
00:09:18,782 --> 00:09:20,583
What? Really?

157
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:22,217
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.

158
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:24,187
I'm far too busy.

159
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:28,091
I have Mavis and Dennis and the
hotel, and bleh, bleh-bleh.

160
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:30,358
Um, did you guys
hear that?

161
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,361
He actually said,
"Bleh, bleh-bleh."

162
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,433
I don't say,
"Bleh, bleh-bleh"!

163
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:45,674
Eh, uh,
I'm looking for a Zing.

164
00:09:45,676 --> 00:09:48,578
<i>Okay. Changing phone ring.</i>

165
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,414
No, no.
I'm looking for a date.

166
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:56,184
No, no, no.

167
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:58,254
I want to meet someone.

168
00:10:00,825 --> 00:10:03,159
Are you kidding me right now?

169
00:10:03,161 --> 00:10:06,294
Don't you get it?
I want to go on a date!

170
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:08,831
I'm lonely.

171
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,435
<i>You want baloney.</i>

172
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,177
What? Look at
that hair. Come on.

173
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:22,778
Ah. Too many eyes.

174
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,514
Too few eyes.

175
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:26,249
Not into tentacles.

176
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,482
"Match found"?

177
00:10:27,484 --> 00:10:29,318
No, no, no!

178
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,653
<i>First things first.</i>

179
00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:31,721
Whoa!

180
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,655
<i>I'm not into games.</i>

181
00:10:33,657 --> 00:10:35,625
<i>You'd better have a job,
and my cats have to like you.</i>

182
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:39,361
Oh, no.

183
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:41,230
Oh, whoa, no.

184
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:42,231
Dad?

185
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:43,565
Oh! Mavis! Oh.

186
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:45,668
Uh, what are you doing here?

187
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,504
I was just checking on the honeymoon
suite, and I heard something.

188
00:10:48,506 --> 00:10:50,606
Oh, I'm sorry,
my little bedbug.

189
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,775
I was just cleaning
the attic.

190
00:10:58,315 --> 00:11:00,415
It's so dirty, ah, yes...

191
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:02,517
- <i>Who is that?</i>
<i>- Are you on the phone?</i>

192
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,557
What, this? I was just
trying to find a maid

193
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,925
- to help me with the mess.
<i>- A maid?</i>

194
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:11,427
<i>Who do you think...</i>

195
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:12,428
Thank you,
I'll check your references

196
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,199
and get back to you. Goodbye!

197
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:19,434
Dad.

198
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:21,236
Stop trying to
hide it from me.

199
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:23,573
Hide? Who?
I mean, what? Me?

200
00:11:23,575 --> 00:11:24,707
Yes.

201
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:26,675
And I know what it is.

202
00:11:26,677 --> 00:11:28,578
Uh... Really?

203
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,313
You're stressed out
from working too hard.

204
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,615
Oh!

205
00:11:32,617 --> 00:11:33,848
Okay, yes.

206
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,384
You got me.

207
00:11:35,386 --> 00:11:37,520
It's a big hotel,
you know?

208
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,255
Can't get to everything.

209
00:11:39,257 --> 00:11:40,389
But what about you?

210
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:42,390
You're pretty busy yourself.

211
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:45,694
I know. It seems like now that
we're working together more,

212
00:11:45,696 --> 00:11:48,264
we're seeing
each other less.

213
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:50,565
Ah. Yeah.
You're absolutely right.

214
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:53,501
I am working too much,
you're working too much.

215
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:56,606
We should really take a break,
starting right now.

216
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:57,776
Night-night.

217
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,746
<i>I'm still here!</i>

218
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,528
Aw.

219
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:21,631
Oh! Hey, honey.

220
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:23,732
You ready for

221
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:25,501
date night?

222
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:26,769
Aw.

223
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:27,969
That's okay, sweetheart.

224
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:29,438
You rest.

225
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:34,510
You know, Dad's right.

226
00:12:34,512 --> 00:12:36,312
We need a break.

227
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:39,381
We need to all be together
again, like a family.

228
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,652
Like we used to.

229
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:46,422
<i>Are you
overworked and stressed out?</i>

230
00:12:46,424 --> 00:12:48,624
<i>Do you need some family time?</i>

231
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:50,726
<i>Are you a monster?</i>

232
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,029
<i>Then you need a vacation,</i>

233
00:12:53,031 --> 00:12:55,363
<i>a monster vacation.</i>

234
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:58,369
<i>♪ Sail away, sail away,
sail away ♪</i>

235
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,804
Welcome aboard
Gremlin Air.

236
00:13:08,378 --> 00:13:10,045
Ah!

237
00:13:19,824 --> 00:13:21,723
Ladies and gentlemen,

238
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:24,092
please direct your attention
to the front of the cabin.

239
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,562
For your safety, please
unbuckle your seat belts.

240
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:28,030
Ooh.

241
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:33,602
In the likely event we experience
a sudden drop in cabin pressure,

242
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,306
oxygen will be provided.

243
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:39,607
Can I stow that
for you, sir?

244
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:40,811
All right. Thanks.

245
00:13:42,913 --> 00:13:45,347
Beverages. Snacks. Beverages.

246
00:13:45,349 --> 00:13:47,083
Beverages. Snacks.

247
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:48,516
Beverages.

248
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:53,956
Ahhh!

249
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,058
- Coffee?
- That would be lovely.

250
00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:05,067
Mavis, please,
you're torturing me.

251
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:07,403
You know I hate surprises.

252
00:14:07,405 --> 00:14:09,738
This is
a fun surprise.

253
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,807
There are no fun surprises.

254
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,641
Just tell me
where we're going.

255
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:15,111
Why are we on a plane?

256
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:17,011
We can fly, you know.

257
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:19,615
Back in my day,
people took trains.

258
00:14:19,617 --> 00:14:21,049
Now, that's classy.

259
00:14:21,051 --> 00:14:24,086
Sure, Dad. Forty hours
in a closet-sized room

260
00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:26,988
with you and Uncle Bernie
and his smelly cigars,

261
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,958
arguing who was
more attractive,

262
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,726
Cleopatra or Nefertiti.

263
00:14:30,728 --> 00:14:32,761
Nefertiti.

264
00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:34,496
Okay, Dad, thank you.

265
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,665
Mavis, this is
such an amazing surprise!

266
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:41,536
I can't wait to spend time
with the people I love most.

267
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:45,607
But I beg of you,
tell me where we're going!

268
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:49,444
Nope. I've taken care of everything,
so you don't need to worry.

269
00:14:49,446 --> 00:14:51,012
You've been
so stressed out lately.

270
00:14:51,014 --> 00:14:53,384
It's time for you to relax.

271
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,192
Now, isn't that better?

272
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,693
Oh, yes.

273
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,031
So relaxed.

274
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:11,467
I'm gonna go check
on you-know-who.

275
00:15:11,469 --> 00:15:13,068
I'll be right back.

276
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,438
I have to go to the bathroom.

277
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,672
Hey, did you see that?

278
00:15:16,674 --> 00:15:18,207
Dennis went to the bathroom!

279
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,045
Uh... Okay.

280
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:25,783
Psst. Hey, where are you?

281
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,688
There you are, Tinkles.

282
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,058
Don't worry, we'd never
leave you home alone.

283
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,193
<i>Okay, folks,
you're free to move</i>

284
00:15:37,195 --> 00:15:38,593
about the cabin, as we have

285
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:39,931
started our descent.

286
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:57,813
So, any big plans
for the weekend there, Bill?

287
00:15:57,815 --> 00:15:59,180
Oh, you know,
the usual.

288
00:15:59,182 --> 00:16:00,982
Got to take the kids
to soccer.

289
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:06,655
Snacks. Beverages.

290
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:08,993
Snacks. Beverages. Snacks.

291
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:24,273
Ladies and gentlemen, we've
arrived at our destination,

292
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,877
the Bermuda Triangle.

293
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:39,991
Ooh!

294
00:17:16,093 --> 00:17:18,627
Welcome to
the Bermuda Triangle,

295
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:22,634
where you'll embark on a
monster cruise of a lifetime.

296
00:17:26,804 --> 00:17:28,202
A cruise?

297
00:17:28,204 --> 00:17:30,072
Surprise!

298
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:31,707
Oh, no, you... No.

299
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:36,111
But it's just like a hotel
on the water.

300
00:17:36,113 --> 00:17:38,279
I just figured
you need a vacation

301
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:40,783
from running
everyone else's vacation.

302
00:17:40,785 --> 00:17:43,619
You've barely been
out of the hotel since...

303
00:17:43,621 --> 00:17:46,688
Well, since Mom died.

304
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,823
But this is a chance
to make new memories,

305
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:50,124
with all of us.

306
00:17:50,126 --> 00:17:52,327
With Dennis.

307
00:17:52,329 --> 00:17:57,801
- Boat!
- Boat!

308
00:18:01,238 --> 00:18:04,206
Who made you
such an amazing daughter?

309
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,373
You.

310
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,874
That's right!

311
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:08,843
What a father I am.

312
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:11,313
Come on, Denisovich,
let's get cruising!

313
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:12,683
Yay!

314
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:34,738
Wow!

315
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:02,363
Okay. Smile.

316
00:19:02,365 --> 00:19:03,899
Thank you.

317
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:14,345
Ow!

318
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:17,182
"No pets allowed"?

319
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:19,150
Uh-oh.

320
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:29,994
Perfect.

321
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,932
Welcome aboard.
How are you doing?

322
00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:39,333
- Dennis, come on.
- Nice to see you.

323
00:19:39,335 --> 00:19:40,869
Oh, lovely shirt. Yes.

324
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:43,675
Oh, hello.
Welcome aboard.

325
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,415
Uh, this is Bob.

326
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:55,016
Say hi, Bob.

327
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:56,186
"Hi, Bob."

328
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,195
Oh, my gosh, Griffin.

329
00:20:06,197 --> 00:20:08,029
I'm, like, so excited.

330
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:10,298
This is, like, the nicest
hotel I've ever been to.

331
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,900
Yeah!

332
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:13,502
Man, this is amazing!

333
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,103
There's so much to do!

334
00:20:15,105 --> 00:20:17,107
Olympic-size swimming pool...

335
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:19,944
<i>All-you-can-eat buffet...</i>

336
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,980
<i>Full-service spa...</i>

337
00:20:25,982 --> 00:20:28,816
Whoo! I'm gonna get me
a seaweed rewrap!

338
00:20:28,818 --> 00:20:31,820
Wow, it sounds like
everything we can do

339
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:33,287
at our hotel!

340
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:35,990
Except on the water!

341
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:50,072
Ooh! Ah!

342
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:52,006
Wow!

343
00:20:52,008 --> 00:20:53,175
You nailed it, honey.

344
00:20:53,177 --> 00:20:55,409
Your dad is going to
love this!

345
00:20:55,411 --> 00:20:57,345
Best summer vacation ever!

346
00:20:57,347 --> 00:20:59,247
Wait till you see
the itinerary.

347
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:00,815
Oh!

348
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:02,184
That's nice.

349
00:21:02,186 --> 00:21:04,952
Frank, "fire bad." Remember?

350
00:21:04,954 --> 00:21:07,555
Oh, yeah, right, but,
uh, maybe you'll find

351
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,124
your own fireworks
on the cruise, huh?

352
00:21:10,126 --> 00:21:12,194
It's not the Love Boat, Frank.

353
00:21:12,196 --> 00:21:15,200
I'm just here to have fun
with my family.

354
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:20,070
Huh?

355
00:21:22,006 --> 00:21:23,205
Ha!

356
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:24,305
Ahoy there!

357
00:21:24,307 --> 00:21:25,873
Welcome aboard!

358
00:21:34,184 --> 00:21:36,053
Whoa! Who is that?

359
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:42,958
I am Captain Ericka.

360
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,827
And, yes, I'm human. But
don't hold that against me.

361
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:48,897
I could not be more excited
to have all of you on board

362
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:51,432
our first-ever
monster cruise!

363
00:21:57,074 --> 00:21:59,076
Whoo-hoo!

364
00:22:00,544 --> 00:22:02,244
Dad? Are you okay?

365
00:22:02,246 --> 00:22:04,580
Eeny feeny fanny
foonyah wah wah?

366
00:22:04,582 --> 00:22:06,614
Oh, no! He's having
a heart attack!

367
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,583
Drac? Not likely.

368
00:22:08,585 --> 00:22:11,018
Yeah, the only heart attack that can
hurt him is with a wooden stake.

369
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,153
It must be a stroke!

370
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:14,156
Actually, I think
it might be her.

371
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:17,124
Ow! Watch where you're pointing,
mister, I'm right here.

372
00:22:17,126 --> 00:22:18,960
You always stand
so close to me.

373
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,896
It's creepy.

374
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:24,065
For so long, monsters were
hiding, living in the shadows,

375
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:26,034
but not anymore!

376
00:22:26,036 --> 00:22:30,037
You've stood up and waved
your hand or claw or tentacle

377
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:35,009
and said, "We're here, we're hairy,
and it is our right to be scary!"

378
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:40,448
Now it's time to celebrate!

379
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,552
You'll enjoy gourmet dining,
thrilling adventures,

380
00:22:43,554 --> 00:22:45,320
and nonstop entertainment,

381
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,422
all on the way
to our final destination,

382
00:22:48,424 --> 00:22:51,525
the lost city
that isn't lost anymore,

383
00:22:51,527 --> 00:22:54,196
Atlantis!

384
00:22:58,501 --> 00:23:00,002
Oh, yeah!

385
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,402
Whoo-hoo!

386
00:23:01,404 --> 00:23:03,639
Whoa!
The fish are acrobats!

387
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:05,474
They're fishcrobats!

388
00:23:08,578 --> 00:23:11,045
Hello. How y'all doing?

389
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:13,247
So...

390
00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:16,621
You must be
the one and only Dracula.

391
00:23:18,488 --> 00:23:22,056
I have waited so long
to meet you.

392
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:24,191
Wow, you really don't age,
do you?

393
00:23:24,193 --> 00:23:25,627
I would kill
for your skin.

394
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:29,031
Eh doobeeday
shoolah eh koobeeday?

395
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,966
Oh. You're speaking
Transylvanian.

396
00:23:30,968 --> 00:23:32,400
Oh. Always wanted
to learn.

397
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:35,269
Uh, eh doobeeday
shoolah koobeeday?

398
00:23:35,271 --> 00:23:37,406
- Eh koobeeday.
- Koobeeday.

399
00:23:37,408 --> 00:23:39,274
- Eh koobeeday.
- Koobeeday.

400
00:23:39,276 --> 00:23:41,310
Eh doobeeday
shoolah koobeeday.

401
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:44,079
Doolah-day shoolah koobeeday.

402
00:23:44,081 --> 00:23:46,314
Oh, such a romantic language.

403
00:23:46,316 --> 00:23:48,249
You know, there's just
something about an accent

404
00:23:48,251 --> 00:23:51,652
that makes a man
sound so intelligent.

405
00:23:51,654 --> 00:23:53,220
Alibooboo.

406
00:23:53,222 --> 00:23:54,957
That's Transylvanian
right there.

407
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:57,059
He's saying
it's nice to meet you.

408
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:00,728
Well, then
"alibooboo" to you as well.

409
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,265
- Alibooboo. Alibooboo.
- Drac! Drac, snap out of it.

410
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:06,200
Wait. I've always wanted
to do this.

411
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:08,269
Wake up! Wake up, Drac!

412
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:09,537
Snap out of it!

413
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,038
Hey, cut it out!

414
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,341
Hey, buddy, you okay?

415
00:24:12,343 --> 00:24:15,009
No, not okay.

What's a kids club?

Whee!

I'm still not sure
I understand.

443
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,815
You take my kids,
all day, on purpose?

444
00:26:34,817 --> 00:26:36,250
Fish.

445
00:26:36,252 --> 00:26:37,518
That's right.

446
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,688
What exactly
don't you understand?

447
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,555

- Shh.

448
00:26:41,557 --> 00:26:45,259

Oh, don't worry, you get them

451
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:53,567
Fish.

452
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:55,705
Oh, well. That's better
than nothing.

453
00:26:57,508 --> 00:26:59,076
Oh. Oh!

454
00:27:05,481 --> 00:27:06,547
So...

455
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:08,182
What do we do now?

456
00:27:08,184 --> 00:27:12,556
I think we do
whatever we want.

457
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,756
"Whatever we want"?

458
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:17,825
Whatever we want.

459
00:27:17,827 --> 00:27:19,227
Whatever we want.

460
00:27:19,229 --> 00:27:20,562
Whatever we want!

461
00:27:20,564 --> 00:27:24,466
Whatever we want.

462
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:27,268
- Stop! Help me!
- Whatever we want.

463
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,306
- Whatever we want.
- Whatever we want.

464
00:27:30,373 --> 00:27:31,840
Oh, hi. Hello.

465
00:27:31,842 --> 00:27:33,507
How y'all doin'?

466
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:34,676
- Oh.
- Good evening, Captain.

467
00:27:34,678 --> 00:27:36,678
Well, hello.
Oh, my goodness.

468
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,546
Ah!

469
00:27:38,548 --> 00:27:42,217
Would you mind, uh, lifting your tail?
You know...

470
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:43,485
Oh! Certainly.

471
00:27:43,487 --> 00:27:45,790
Okay. Thank you
so much.

472
00:27:48,191 --> 00:27:49,658
Oh, hello.

473
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,728
Welcome aboard.

474
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,590
Ugh! You were so right,
Great-Grandfather.

475
00:28:21,592 --> 00:28:24,492
Monsters are disgusting!

476
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,430
They're animals!

477
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,412
I'll be right there.

478
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:55,623
Dracula, is he on board?

479
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:58,927
Yes. I saw him.
Face-to-face. Ugh!

480
00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:00,562
I was so nice to him.

481
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:02,863
That pale face of his
and his goofy smile,

482
00:29:02,865 --> 00:29:04,565
showing off his fangs.

483
00:29:04,567 --> 00:29:06,368
Argh, it's just like
you taught me!

484
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,937
It's even worse than I feared!

485
00:29:08,939 --> 00:29:12,040
It was that fateful night
that I realized

486
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:15,643
a human could never defeat
a monster.

487
00:29:19,783 --> 00:29:23,618
<i>But I wouldn't let
our family legacy die.</i>

488
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:28,590
<i>And so, I began to search
for an answer.</i>

489
00:29:28,592 --> 00:29:33,861
<i>And I saw it in an ancient text,
an instrument of destruction</i>

490
00:29:33,863 --> 00:29:36,398
<i>so powerful
it destroyed Atlantis,</i>

491
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,302
<i>a whole city of monsters.</i>

492
00:29:40,304 --> 00:29:44,572
<i>And there, deep within the
rubble, it lay, waiting.</i>

493
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:48,375
Endlessly, I searched
for the lost city

494
00:29:48,377 --> 00:29:51,880
Time passed, and my body
began to fail me.

495
00:29:51,882 --> 00:29:54,481
Oh, it was so sad, Ericka.

496
00:29:54,483 --> 00:29:56,985
First my liver,
then my spleen,

497
00:29:56,987 --> 00:29:59,653
followed by a kidney or two.

498
00:29:59,655 --> 00:30:03,324
Then my golden locks.

499
00:30:03,326 --> 00:30:05,860
But I wouldn't let
that stop me.

500
00:30:05,862 --> 00:30:10,832
I replaced my failing organs
with technology!

501
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:12,534
Ha-ha!

502
00:30:12,536 --> 00:30:14,436
And look at me now.

503
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,036
Mmm-hmm!

504
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:18,908
Oh, girl,
it's an improvement, really.

505
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:22,343
Um, sure.

506
00:30:22,345 --> 00:30:28,015
And now, after 120 years,
I have finally found Atlantis.

507
00:30:28,017 --> 00:30:29,851
Oh, forget about all this!

508
00:30:29,853 --> 00:30:31,452
Let me get rid of
Dracula right now.

509
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,088
I was so close to him,
I could've just...

510
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,659
No, no, no!

511
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:39,694
We have to
stick to the plan.

512
00:30:39,696 --> 00:30:41,563
Lure the monsters
to Atlantis,

513
00:30:41,565 --> 00:30:43,931
retrieve the instrument
of destruction,

514
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:46,801
trap them there,
and then wipe them out.

515
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,636
It's simple, Ericka!

516
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:51,706
Now, promise me you won't
try and kill Dracula.

517
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:53,108
Ugh, fine!

518
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,543
- I promise.
- Promise what?

519
00:30:55,545 --> 00:30:59,080
I promise I won't
try and kill Dracula. Okay?

520
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:05,620
Ugh.

521
00:31:05,622 --> 00:31:09,690
Don't worry, Great-Grandfather,
I won't try and kill him...

522
00:31:09,692 --> 00:31:11,461
I will kill him.

555

Captain Ericka?

560
00:33:13,682 --> 00:33:15,249
Oh, no!

561
00:33:15,251 --> 00:33:17,584
Uh, what? Eh, oh...

562
00:33:17,586 --> 00:33:18,986
Oops, no,
not her.

563
00:33:20,556 --> 00:33:22,189
Ooh, that's good!

564
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:23,291
Very amusing.

565
00:33:32,701 --> 00:33:35,602
Sorry, Drac. You know, it's just
we've never seen you like this.

566
00:33:35,604 --> 00:33:36,838
I know.

567
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,238
It doesn't make any sense.

568
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,975
You can't Zing twice,
it's impossible!

569
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,277
But I did! So now what?

570
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,947
And what about Mavis?

571
00:33:45,949 --> 00:33:48,082
She wants you
to be happy, right?

572
00:33:48,084 --> 00:33:50,919
I'm sure she'll go
with the flow.

573
00:33:50,921 --> 00:33:52,653
Oh, no, no, no!

574
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:55,122
Mavis needs me.
She depends on me.

575
00:33:55,124 --> 00:33:58,191
I need to be home
with my family.

576
00:33:58,193 --> 00:34:02,296
Hey, Murray here may be from
Egypt, but you're the one in

577
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:03,831
"da Nile."

578
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,000
You guys get that?

579
00:34:07,002 --> 00:34:08,268
Ow! You hit me right in the...

580
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,273
Mavis!

581
00:34:13,008 --> 00:34:15,278
Don't say a word, or
I'll haunt your dreams.

582
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:18,613
Having fun?

583
00:34:18,615 --> 00:34:21,014
Oh, I'm having even more fun
now that you're here.

584
00:34:21,016 --> 00:34:25,119
You know, Dad, I feel really lucky
to have this time with you.

585
00:34:25,121 --> 00:34:28,021
All of us together,
it's really special.

586
00:34:28,023 --> 00:34:30,925
Me, too,
spider monkey.

587
00:34:30,927 --> 00:34:34,195
Now, are you ready for me to
destroy you in monster ball?

588
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,965
Whoo-hoo! Monster ball!

589
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:38,231
Come on, Papa Drac!

590
00:34:38,233 --> 00:34:39,934
Bring it on!

591
00:34:39,936 --> 00:34:42,539
For I am king of family fun!

592
00:34:45,175 --> 00:34:48,910
Ha-ha! All right!
Who is ready to get pummeled?

593
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,613
I got to warn you,

594
00:34:52,615 --> 00:34:55,617
I played second-team coed intramural
volleyball at Santa Cruz.

595
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:58,318
Sure, pal. Whatever you say.

596
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,055
Everybody, just please
watch the hair.

597
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,889
Watch the hair!

598
00:35:02,891 --> 00:35:05,293
Oh-ho-ho! Let's go!
Let's do this!

599
00:35:05,295 --> 00:35:07,762
Oh, my gosh, this is
gonna be so much fun.

600
00:35:07,764 --> 00:35:09,130
Ha-ha! Get ready.

601
00:35:09,132 --> 00:35:10,733
Here comes the pain!

602
00:35:14,336 --> 00:35:17,171
- Spike!
- Not the hair!

603
00:35:17,173 --> 00:35:18,976
Whoa!

604
00:35:20,876 --> 00:35:23,211
No, no, no!

605
00:35:24,347 --> 00:35:27,247
All right!

606
00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:30,418
<i>Captain
Ericka, you are needed on deck.</i>

607
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,820
Next stop...
Buh-bye, Dracula.

608
00:35:33,822 --> 00:35:35,358
Ha-ha! All right, baby!

609
00:35:57,681 --> 00:35:59,113
Oh, baby, I got this.

610
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,682
Hey there, monsters.

611
00:36:00,684 --> 00:36:01,619
Huh?

612
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,222
Yeah! What'd I say!

613
00:36:09,124 --> 00:36:11,362
<i>We're arriving
at our first destination.</i>

614
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,133
<i>The underwater volcano!</i>

615
00:36:20,135 --> 00:36:24,238
<i>Everyone, grab your scuba
gear and get ready to explore</i>

616
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,644
<i>the wonders of the sea.</i>

617
00:36:27,277 --> 00:36:29,242
Especially you,

618
00:36:29,244 --> 00:36:30,813
Count Dracula.

619
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,784
You see that, pal?
She likes you.

620
00:36:36,786 --> 00:36:38,151
Oh, no, no, no.

621
00:36:38,153 --> 00:36:40,220
That sounds like a Zing
in full effect.

622
00:36:40,222 --> 00:36:42,122
Oh, no, no, no.

623
00:36:42,124 --> 00:36:43,825
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

624
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,461
I'm just here
to have family fun.

625
00:36:46,463 --> 00:36:48,766
Family, family, fun, fun.

626
00:37:10,385 --> 00:37:12,822
Hmm, let's see.
What about here?

627
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,379
Right this way, everyone.

628
00:37:47,456 --> 00:37:51,425
Welcome to one of the true wonders
of the underwater kingdom.

629
00:37:51,427 --> 00:37:54,961
I give you Volcano del Fuego.

630
00:37:54,963 --> 00:37:57,264
Or, as the local sea life
call it...

631
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,126
Whee!

632
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,215
Aw, what a cute family.

633
00:39:55,217 --> 00:39:56,284
What? No, it's not.

634
00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:58,121
Argh! Dracula bad!

635
00:41:13,028 --> 00:41:14,394
Frank, we just ate.

636
00:41:14,396 --> 00:41:16,564
I can't believe
you're hungry already.

637
00:41:16,566 --> 00:41:18,298
I'm sorry.
You know what it is?

638
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,233
It's all... Just all that
seafood just swimming around,

639
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:22,202
and when I "see food..."

640
00:41:22,204 --> 00:41:25,305
Oh, man! I'm gone.

641
00:41:25,307 --> 00:41:28,242
Oh! Dracula, Dracula, Dracula!

642
00:41:28,244 --> 00:41:30,311
Dracula, Dracula!

643
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:33,414
I get so close, but it's
almost like he's teasing me.

644
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:35,648
I just, I can't
stand it anymore.

645
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,953
I have to get him!

646
00:41:47,729 --> 00:41:51,164
Boy, that underwater volcano
looked hot.

647
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:53,036
Mmm-hmm.

648
00:41:56,738 --> 00:41:58,671
Oh... Hi, Bob.

649
00:41:58,673 --> 00:42:02,642
Right. We promised you we'd
play, uh, ping-pong now.

650
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:05,211
Um, Dennis?
Who is this?

651
00:42:05,213 --> 00:42:07,280
Uh, it's our friend, Bob.

652
00:42:07,282 --> 00:42:09,118
- Say hi, Bob.
- "Hi, Bob."

653
00:42:10,586 --> 00:42:13,586
Okay! Time to go
play ping-pong.

654
00:42:13,588 --> 00:42:14,722
- Drac!
- Drac!

655
00:42:14,724 --> 00:42:17,327
- Drac!
- Drac!

656
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,361
Hey, boys,
where's the fire?

657
00:42:21,363 --> 00:42:22,729
Oh, well,
Griffin here, he...

658
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:25,099
- He has something to tell you.
- Me? Uh...

659
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:27,468
Oh. Yeah, I got this bite on
my hand, and since, you know,

660
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,769
you're a biting expert, I
thought you could take a look.

661
00:42:29,771 --> 00:42:31,340
- Yeah. Come on over here.
- The light is better.

662
00:42:32,574 --> 00:42:34,110
Okay...

663
00:42:35,811 --> 00:42:38,211
Okay, what is going on?

664
00:42:38,213 --> 00:42:41,247
You guys are acting weirder than normal,
and your normal is pretty weird.

665
00:42:41,249 --> 00:42:43,249

But what are you talking about?

674
00:43:02,472 --> 00:43:04,771
Okay, well, see, Frank got
hungry, so no surprise there...

675
00:43:04,773 --> 00:43:08,642
But we swam back to the ship, and
we found Ericka raving about you.

676
00:43:08,644 --> 00:43:10,477
She can't live

Uh, yes.

681
00:43:21,289 --> 00:43:23,791
- Maybe? No.
- Ugh.

682
00:43:23,793 --> 00:43:27,128
It's been a while. I don't
even know where to start.

683
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,530
It's easy, Drac.
Just make some small talk.

684
00:43:29,532 --> 00:43:31,365
- Remember to smile.
- Look into her eyes.

685
00:43:31,367 --> 00:43:33,367
- Keep it casual.
- Say something funny.

686
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:34,635
Ask her where
her parts are from.

687
00:43:34,637 --> 00:43:36,336
Oh, and say
that her wrappings look nice.

688
00:43:36,338 --> 00:43:38,139
- "Do you like coffins?"
- Compliment her.

689
00:43:38,141 --> 00:43:40,140
- "Your neck looks delicious."
- Here she comes.

690
00:43:40,142 --> 00:43:42,543
Okay, Drac,
hit it.

691
00:43:42,545 --> 00:43:44,744
Your delicious neck wrappings
are in a nice coffin.

692
00:43:44,746 --> 00:43:47,648
Would you like
to see my parts?

693
00:43:50,452 --> 00:43:52,552
Yes, I'd love to go out

00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:28,418
<i>and we hope you'll find yourself
some fun and relaxation.</i>

711
00:45:29,751 --> 00:45:31,918
Whoo-hoo!
Beach time!

712
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,753
Johnny, you go
set everything up.

713
00:45:33,755 --> 00:45:35,689
And, Dad, you go get in
line for the snow cones.

714
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:38,459
You know, actually,
I was thinking you and Johnny

715
00:45:38,461 --> 00:45:40,293
should spend
some time together.

716
00:45:40,295 --> 00:45:42,729
What do you call it again?
Eh, date night?

717
00:45:42,731 --> 00:45:44,264
Date night?

718
00:45:44,266 --> 00:45:46,032
- What are you gonna do?
- Well, I thought

719
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:48,401
me and the guys would
take this opportunity

720
00:45:48,403 --> 00:45:51,505
to spend some quality time
with Dennis.

721
00:45:51,507 --> 00:45:53,374
Oh. Okay.
That's a great idea.

722
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:55,041
Come on, Johnny.
Date night.

723
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,813
Duh-duh-duh-duh-date night!

724
00:46:12,695 --> 00:46:14,494
Okay, here you go!

725
00:46:19,635 --> 00:46:21,438
- Good girl!
- I got this one.

726
00:46:30,478 --> 00:46:31,979
What was that?

727
00:46:31,981 --> 00:46:33,880
It sounds like our children.

728
00:46:33,882 --> 00:46:36,717
- It is our children! Run!
- Run!

729
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:38,785
Please! Help! Someone!

730
00:46:38,787 --> 00:46:40,753
Get the parents!

731
00:46:40,755 --> 00:46:43,691
Frank? Would you rub
some moonscreen on my back

732
00:46:43,693 --> 00:46:45,325
before I get burned?

733
00:46:45,327 --> 00:46:46,526
Wait one second, honey.

734
00:46:46,528 --> 00:46:47,860
You know, the kids buried me
in the sand.

735
00:46:54,369 --> 00:46:56,035
Mmm. Thanks, honey.

736
00:46:56,037 --> 00:46:58,539
- Shall we have another?
- Sure.

737
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:01,874
- Sounds good.
- Straight up.

738
00:47:01,876 --> 00:47:04,010
Isn't this place amazing?

739
00:47:04,012 --> 00:47:07,014
Whoa! The menu is in a bottle!

740
00:47:07,016 --> 00:47:08,918
Genius! Isn't that
awesome, honey?

741
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,052
What? Oh, sorry.

742
00:47:13,054 --> 00:47:15,055
I was just thinking
about my dad.

743
00:47:15,057 --> 00:47:17,958
Don't you think
he's acting weird lately?

744
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,394
Not really. Besides having
a huge crush on the captain.

745
00:47:21,396 --> 00:47:23,363
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

746
00:47:23,365 --> 00:47:25,932
The Love Boat is definitely
making another run.

747
00:47:25,934 --> 00:47:27,700
No way. He's...

748
00:47:27,702 --> 00:47:29,970
He's my dad.

749
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,771
I know, right? It's weird.

750
00:47:31,773 --> 00:47:35,608
When my parents kiss,
I still close my eyes.

751
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:40,914
I guess I never thought about
him with anyone besides my mom.

752
00:47:40,916 --> 00:47:43,416
You're cool with it,
though, right?

753
00:47:43,418 --> 00:47:45,552
Of course. I want him
to be happy.

754
00:47:45,554 --> 00:47:46,556
Totally.

755
00:47:48,624 --> 00:47:50,456
Totally.

756
00:47:56,699 --> 00:47:59,166
<i>Buenas noches, mi amigo.</i>

757
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:05,171
Have you a beverage
to quench me of my parchment?

758
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,677
Yes, of course,
Mr. Chupacabra.

759
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:13,516
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

760
00:48:29,465 --> 00:48:30,798
You look ravishing.

761
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,898
Oh.

762
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,099
Uh, thank you. I just...

763
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:34,603
Oh.

764
00:48:43,646 --> 00:48:45,512
So, um...

765
00:48:45,514 --> 00:48:48,581
Does Captain Ericka
have a last name?

766
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,050
Uh, oh, uh...

767
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,186
Oh, guacamole!

768
00:48:52,188 --> 00:48:53,720
"Ericka Guacamole"?

769
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:57,057
That's so international.

770
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,860
No.
Guacamole for us to share.

771
00:49:00,862 --> 00:49:03,229
Oh, how beautiful
is that full moon tonight?

772
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,666
Look. Right behind you.

773
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:12,539
Mmm! The food here
is to die for.

774
00:49:23,184 --> 00:49:27,119
Holy moly, that was
a lot of guacamole.

775
00:49:27,121 --> 00:49:29,490
Are you feeling all right?

776
00:49:29,492 --> 00:49:32,159
- Totally fine. Why?
- No reason.

777
00:49:34,028 --> 00:49:35,695
Oh...

778
00:49:35,697 --> 00:49:39,131
There must have been garlic
in the guacamole.

779
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:40,666
Oh, no.

780
00:49:40,668 --> 00:49:42,135
Isn't that deadly
for you?

781
00:49:42,137 --> 00:49:44,106
No, no, no.
It's just that I'm...

782
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:46,708
Garlic intolerant.

783
00:49:55,016 --> 00:49:56,185
Was that you?

784
00:49:58,019 --> 00:50:00,787
Whoo!

785
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,021
Oh, yeah!

786
00:50:02,023 --> 00:50:04,224
Dolphin surfing!

787
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,932
Whoa!

788
00:50:12,934 --> 00:50:14,867
Hi, Mama. Hi, Papa.

789
00:50:14,869 --> 00:50:16,003
Hey-hey.

790
00:50:16,005 --> 00:50:17,738
Oh! Hey there.

791
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,740
- Papa.
- Hidey-ho!

792
00:50:19,742 --> 00:50:20,941
Hi.

793
00:50:20,943 --> 00:50:23,309
Is my dad
in there, too?

794
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,914
Don't worry,
I'm over here. Bleh, bleh-bleh.

795
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:31,954
No, Papa Drac's not here.
He's on his date.

796
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,822
Date?

797
00:50:36,724 --> 00:50:39,191
Please, forgive me,

798
00:50:39,193 --> 00:50:40,894
I'm just very nervous.

799
00:50:40,896 --> 00:50:42,863
You see,

800
00:50:42,865 --> 00:50:48,104
I haven't had a date
since my wife died.

801
00:50:50,139 --> 00:50:52,072
How old was your daughter?

802
00:50:52,074 --> 00:50:54,041
She was just an infant.

803
00:50:54,043 --> 00:50:56,008
It was hard
being a single dad,

804
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:58,547
but I did my best.

805
00:51:01,215 --> 00:51:03,983
I never knew
my mother, either.

806
00:51:03,985 --> 00:51:05,151
Or my father.

807
00:51:05,153 --> 00:51:07,354
Oh, I'm so sorry.

808
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:08,889
Who raised you?

809
00:51:08,891 --> 00:51:10,958
My great-grandfather.

810
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,660
I basically grew up
on this ship.

811
00:51:13,662 --> 00:51:15,896
That's why
you're a captain.

812
00:51:15,898 --> 00:51:19,166
Yeah. It's all
I've ever known.

813
00:51:19,168 --> 00:51:21,671
It was just expected.

814
00:51:22,637 --> 00:51:24,137
You know, a family thing.

815
00:51:24,139 --> 00:51:28,075
I understand,
family is everything.

816
00:51:28,077 --> 00:51:30,843
You have to honor the past.

817
00:51:30,845 --> 00:51:33,115
But we make our own future.

818
00:51:46,362 --> 00:51:48,361
- Dad?
- Mavis!

819
00:51:48,363 --> 00:51:50,900
- Mmm.
- Johnny!

820
00:51:53,267 --> 00:51:58,305
Captain Ericka and I were just
discussing the hospitality industry.

821
00:51:58,307 --> 00:52:00,374
You know,
just work stuff.

822
00:52:00,376 --> 00:52:01,941
You're working now?

823
00:52:01,943 --> 00:52:03,843
This is supposed to be
a vacation.

824
00:52:03,845 --> 00:52:05,244
A family vacation.

825
00:52:05,246 --> 00:52:08,881
I should really go
do captain-y things.

826
00:52:08,883 --> 00:52:11,918
Dad, you said you were
gonna spend time with Dennis.

827
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,122
Dennis. Dennis? Dennis.

828
00:52:15,124 --> 00:52:17,890
Oh! Yeah, you're right.
Where is that kid?

829
00:52:17,892 --> 00:52:20,427
Denisovich? You're
supposed to be with me.

830
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,695
Come on now, kid,
it's family time.

831
00:52:22,697 --> 00:52:24,199
Quit hiding. Dennis?

832
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:26,967
What was that about?

833
00:52:26,969 --> 00:52:28,267
You mean
your dad's date?

834
00:52:28,269 --> 00:52:31,271
It wasn't a date.
It was work stuff.

835
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,439
Uh-huh.

836
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:34,273
I'm telling you, Johnny,

837
00:52:34,275 --> 00:52:36,108
there is something about
that woman I don't trust.

838
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:39,211
But you want your dad
to be happy, right?

839
00:52:39,213 --> 00:52:40,713
Yes.

840
00:52:40,715 --> 00:52:42,749
Just not with her.

841
00:52:42,751 --> 00:52:44,450
Mmm.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

842
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,885
Heads up, honey.

843
00:52:45,887 --> 00:52:48,055
This guac is loaded
with garlic.

844
00:52:48,057 --> 00:52:49,125
Garlic?

845
00:52:55,863 --> 00:52:58,166
Aw! That was
a cute toot, honey.

846
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:18,285
- We've been up all night!
- Let's stay up all day, too!

847
00:53:18,287 --> 00:53:20,186
Let's get wild!

848
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,901
- Ericka!
- What?

849
00:53:34,903 --> 00:53:38,271
Just where have you been, young lady?

850
00:53:38,273 --> 00:53:40,740
Uh, doing work.

851
00:53:40,742 --> 00:53:42,742
Wearing that?

852
00:53:42,744 --> 00:53:45,278
You were with him!
I know it!

853
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,247
Who?

854
00:53:47,249 --> 00:53:49,381
"Who?" You know who!

855
00:53:49,383 --> 00:53:51,952
You've been sneaking around
my back

856
00:53:51,954 --> 00:53:55,287
trying to kill Dracula again,
haven't you?

857
00:53:55,289 --> 00:53:58,090
So what if I have?
I am a grown woman!

858
00:53:58,092 --> 00:53:59,392
I have the right to kill
whoever I want.

859
00:53:59,394 --> 00:54:01,861
It's not just about you.

860
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:05,164
You could have ruined
the legacy.

861
00:54:05,166 --> 00:54:07,934
What if he discovered
who you were?

862
00:54:07,936 --> 00:54:11,238
I know. I wasn't thinking.
There's just something about him

863
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,173
that just drives me crazy!

864
00:54:13,175 --> 00:54:15,307
I just, I see him,
and I want to...

865
00:54:15,309 --> 00:54:16,443
Punch him?

866
00:54:16,445 --> 00:54:19,146
Uh... I guess.

867
00:54:19,148 --> 00:54:21,213
Just, I can't wait
to get this over with.

868
00:54:21,215 --> 00:54:23,450
Don't worry,
it won't be long now.

869
00:54:23,452 --> 00:54:26,887
Once you recover the
instrument of destruction,

870
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:28,889
no one can stop us.

871
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,760
Not even Dracula!

872
00:54:31,827 --> 00:54:34,197
- Oh. Excuse me.
- Spies!

873
00:54:38,867 --> 00:54:41,200
Now, quickly,
before someone comes!

874
00:55:02,324 --> 00:55:04,958
<i>Everyone assemble
on the forward deck.</i>

875
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,861
<i>We are arriving
at our final destination.</i>

876
00:55:08,863 --> 00:55:10,430
From the depths of creation,

877
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:14,166
the mighty city has risen
once again.

878
00:55:14,168 --> 00:55:16,970
<i>Home to the greatest
monster civilization</i>

879
00:55:16,972 --> 00:55:18,872
<i>the world has ever known,</i>

880
00:55:18,874 --> 00:55:23,577
far surpassing Athens and Rome in
art, culture and sophistication.

881
00:55:23,579 --> 00:55:28,918
I give you the legendary
lost city of Atlantis.

882
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:57,209
It's a giant Kraken!

883
00:55:57,211 --> 00:56:00,079
<i>♪ There's a place

884
00:56:00,081 --> 00:56:03,416
<i>♪ A thousand leagues

00:56:03,418 --> 00:56:08,320

00:56:09,624 --> 00:56:12,892

Ooh. I am so excited!

899
00:57:08,282 --> 00:57:09,585
Come to Daddy!

900
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,586
- Oh.
- Twenty-eight black!

901
00:57:15,157 --> 00:57:16,092
Oh!

902
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:20,660
- Ahhh!
- Oh, no, you don't.

903
00:57:20,662 --> 00:57:23,662
Last time you gambled, you lost
an arm and a leg. Literally!

904
00:57:23,664 --> 00:57:25,664
- Replacement limbs...
- I'll raise you 40.

905
00:57:25,666 --> 00:57:28,133
...aren't just lying around
like they were in the old days.

906
00:57:28,135 --> 00:57:30,436
So, no gambling.

907
00:57:30,438 --> 00:57:31,570
Frank!

908
00:57:31,572 --> 00:57:33,508
Yes, dear! Got it!
No gambling!

909
00:57:40,048 --> 00:57:41,715
- Tinkles, stop.
- Wait.

910
00:57:41,717 --> 00:57:44,017
- Stop it, Tinkles, stop.
- Ah! Wait!

911
00:57:47,521 --> 00:57:49,555
Have you guys seen Mavis?
I have to find her.

912
00:57:49,557 --> 00:57:51,057
Why? What's going on?

913
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:53,093
I'm going to tell her
about Ericka.

914
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:55,561
I can't lie to
my own daughter anymore.

915
00:57:55,563 --> 00:57:58,465
She's the most important
person in the world to me.

916
00:57:58,467 --> 00:58:00,469
I have to tell her the truth.

917
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:04,506
Right after I talk to Ericka.

918
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:07,977
Hey.

919
00:58:10,211 --> 00:58:11,543
All right, I'm all...

920
00:58:11,545 --> 00:58:13,613
Frank, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

921
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:16,319
I got this. I'm all in.

922
00:58:19,487 --> 00:58:21,421
Johnny, have you seen
my dad?

923
00:58:21,423 --> 00:58:24,157
- Maybe he's with Bob.
- Why would he be with Bob?

924
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:26,159
Bob's a great guy.

925
00:58:26,161 --> 00:58:28,229
- Oh, there he is.
- Who? Bob?

926
00:58:45,579 --> 00:58:48,481
There he is!
Hi, Bob!

927
01:00:13,869 --> 01:00:15,071
Oh.

928
01:01:27,508 --> 01:01:28,711
There it is.

929
01:01:47,228 --> 01:01:48,695
You saved my life.

930
01:01:48,697 --> 01:01:50,630
Of course.
Why wouldn't I?

931
01:01:50,632 --> 01:01:54,267
I just can't believe you
would do that for a human.

932
01:01:54,269 --> 01:01:57,302
Humans, monsters,
what's the difference?

933
01:01:57,304 --> 01:02:00,340
Yeah, right. Right.

934
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:02,575
Wait. What are you doing here?

935
01:02:02,577 --> 01:02:06,412
Oh, uh... Well, you know,
vampires can predict the future,

936
01:02:06,414 --> 01:02:09,448
so I knew you would
need my help.

937
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:11,684
Ha! Never heard that before.

938
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,753
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's a well-known fact.

939
01:02:14,956 --> 01:02:16,622
What are you doing here?

940
01:02:16,624 --> 01:02:17,756
Oh! Uh...

941
01:02:17,758 --> 01:02:19,858
Well, I'm here to get that.

942
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:21,827
Yeah, it's a family heirloom.

943
01:02:21,829 --> 01:02:26,465
Yeah, it was lost at sea, and
my great-grandfather is... Was!

944
01:02:26,467 --> 01:02:29,802
Uh, was totally obsessed
with getting it back.

945
01:02:29,804 --> 01:02:34,242
So, anywho, thanks for saving my
life, but I can take it from...

946
01:02:39,981 --> 01:02:41,514
Got to be
a little more careful.

947
01:02:41,516 --> 01:02:43,416
How many times
can you save my life, right?

948
01:02:43,418 --> 01:02:45,885
I don't know. Every time?

949
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,457
Really? Well, then...

950
01:03:23,023 --> 01:03:24,359
Wow!

951
01:03:41,876 --> 01:03:44,847
Ah,
that was incredible.

952
01:03:56,023 --> 01:03:57,657
Oh, uh...

953
01:03:57,659 --> 01:04:00,762
Don't you want to get
your family heirloom thingy?

954
01:04:01,595 --> 01:04:03,398
Oh. Right.

955
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,836
Got it.

956
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,700
Mmm.

957
01:04:41,702 --> 01:04:43,568
Oh, here, let me get
that for you.

958
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,008
Dad!

959
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:49,941
Mavis!

960
01:04:49,943 --> 01:04:51,744
What are you doing
to my father?

961
01:04:51,746 --> 01:04:53,713
Wait! Whoa. Whoa!

962
01:04:53,715 --> 01:04:55,981
Mavis, stop!
Put her down!

963
01:04:55,983 --> 01:04:59,485
No! She's trying to hurt you.
Why can't you see that?

964
01:05:00,889 --> 01:05:03,755
Because I...

965
01:05:03,757 --> 01:05:05,992
Because I Zinged.

966
01:05:05,994 --> 01:05:07,492
What?

967
01:05:07,494 --> 01:05:10,031
I Zinged with Ericka.

968
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:13,499
No, that can't be true.

969
01:05:13,501 --> 01:05:15,034
You only Zing once.

970
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,669
That's what I thought, too.

971
01:05:17,671 --> 01:05:19,972
"Zing"? What's a Zing?

972
01:05:19,974 --> 01:05:24,010
Uh, well, it's a thing
for monsters.

973
01:05:24,012 --> 01:05:26,813
It's kind of like
our "love at first sight."

974
01:05:26,815 --> 01:05:29,648
What? No. No, no, no.

975
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:31,983
- You don't even know me.
- Well, not yet.

976
01:05:31,985 --> 01:05:34,486
- But we're just...
- No, you don't understand.

977
01:05:34,488 --> 01:05:36,021
I can't be with you.

978
01:05:36,023 --> 01:05:38,958
I could never be
with someone like you.

979
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,095
I could never be with

980
01:05:41,028 --> 01:05:42,130
a monster.

981
01:05:52,874 --> 01:05:55,640
Dad, I'm so sorry.

982
01:05:55,642 --> 01:05:57,445
- I...
- It doesn't matter.

983
01:05:59,746 --> 01:06:01,482
You heard what she said.

984
01:06:09,057 --> 01:06:10,892
But a Zing never lies.

985
01:06:25,173 --> 01:06:27,142
Ha! You got it!

986
01:06:28,242 --> 01:06:29,677
Yes.

987
01:06:33,914 --> 01:06:36,615
Now that we have
the instrument of destruction,

988
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:39,552
our family legacy
will be fulfilled.

989
01:06:39,554 --> 01:06:44,055
But first, we'll draw them in
with a dance party!

990
01:06:44,057 --> 01:06:46,758
I love to dance.

991
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:02,275
Frank,
could you zip me up?

992
01:07:02,277 --> 01:07:04,242
We're gonna be late.

993
01:07:04,244 --> 01:07:06,546
Where did you get those?

994
01:07:06,548 --> 01:07:08,747
Uh, see,
here's the funny thing.

995
01:07:08,749 --> 01:07:11,651
I lost my hands gambling,
but... It's no big deal!

996
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:13,718
Look, I got these
from the seafood buffet.

997
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:16,088
Look at this. Clickety-click,
click, clack, clack, click, click.

998
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:18,494
I kind of like 'em.
I like 'em.

999
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:25,932
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm.

1000
01:07:25,934 --> 01:07:27,733
Mmm. Mmm.

1001
01:07:27,735 --> 01:07:28,871
A-ha!

1002
01:07:52,327 --> 01:07:54,160
Ah, I guess the party's
this way.

1003
01:07:54,162 --> 01:07:55,097
Whoo!

1004
01:07:56,229 --> 01:07:57,699
Whoa!

1005
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,043
Wow.

1006
01:08:10,744 --> 01:08:13,311
Let's get this party
started right!

1007
01:08:13,313 --> 01:08:14,780
- Whoo-hoo!
- All right!

1008
01:08:14,782 --> 01:08:15,784
What?

1009
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:18,750
Huh?

1010
01:08:18,752 --> 01:08:21,754
I thought they said
the party was this way.

1011
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:50,281
DJ in a clamshell?

1012
01:08:50,283 --> 01:08:52,785
I'm so jealous.

1013
01:09:39,434 --> 01:09:43,402
I can't believe my dad Zinged with
someone who's trying to kill him.

1014
01:09:43,404 --> 01:09:45,804
Yeah, the Zing
makes you do crazy things.

1015
01:09:45,806 --> 01:09:48,040
Really, Johnny?

1016
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:52,812
What's most important to understand
is that love is an infinite enigma

1017
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:55,080
that is beyond
our understanding.

1018
01:09:55,082 --> 01:09:58,451
You and I were two halves,
a world apart.

1019
01:09:58,453 --> 01:10:01,487
But then we followed
the strands of destiny

1020
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:03,254
and were brought together.

1021
01:10:03,256 --> 01:10:06,224
And our halves made one whole.

1022
01:10:06,226 --> 01:10:08,427
But what if she and he...

1023
01:10:08,429 --> 01:10:11,996
You must release all the
negativity and look within.

1024
01:10:11,998 --> 01:10:14,036
Your bond is unbreakable.

1025
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:18,237
You're right, honey. Wow.

1026
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:19,738
Thanks.

1027
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:22,107
Whoa, you sounded
pretty smart, Dad.

1028
01:10:22,109 --> 01:10:24,143
Oh, that? Yeah, it was
just the philosophy

1029
01:10:24,145 --> 01:10:26,911
of Sifu Sing from my favorite
TV show when I was a kid,

1030
01:10:26,913 --> 01:10:28,513
<i>Kung Fu Shaolin Monk Master.</i>

1031
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:30,182
Anyways, let's get back
to dancing!

1032
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:31,319
Cool.

1033
01:10:35,489 --> 01:10:38,057
Dad? You have to talk
to Ericka.

1034
01:10:38,059 --> 01:10:39,157
- What?
- I know.

1035
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:40,992
I know what I said before,

1036
01:10:40,994 --> 01:10:43,862
but maybe I overreacted
a teensy bit.

1037
01:10:43,864 --> 01:10:46,165
It's just the thought
of losing you.

1038
01:10:46,167 --> 01:10:49,300
What? What are you talking
about, losing me?

1039
01:10:49,302 --> 01:10:51,336
Well, obviously,
after you get married,

1040
01:10:51,338 --> 01:10:53,304
you're gonna live on the ship
and travel around the world...

1041
01:10:53,306 --> 01:10:55,907
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Mavis.

1042
01:10:55,909 --> 01:10:58,143
There are two things
I can promise you.

1043
01:10:58,145 --> 01:11:03,982
One, nothing can ever take me
from you and all my family.

1044
01:11:03,984 --> 01:11:07,255
Two, I will never live
on a boat.

1045
01:11:09,791 --> 01:11:12,258
You're my cute
little tarantula.

1046
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:14,393
How could I ever leave you?

1047
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,394
Now, seriously,
go talk to her.

1048
01:11:16,396 --> 01:11:18,798
I can't. You heard
what she said,

1049
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,500
she could never be
with someone like me.

1050
01:11:21,502 --> 01:11:23,835
No, Dad.
You're just a half,

1051
01:11:23,837 --> 01:11:27,339
and you have to follow your destiny
to find an infinite whole.

1052
01:11:27,341 --> 01:11:29,174
You sound like Johnny.

1053
01:11:29,176 --> 01:11:32,076
Point is,
you can't deny a Zing.

1054
01:11:32,078 --> 01:11:34,847
Monster, human, unicorn...

1055
01:11:34,849 --> 01:11:35,917
It doesn't matter.

1056
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:38,886
So go to her! Now!

1057
01:11:40,354 --> 01:11:41,987
Okay. I'm on it.

1058
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:45,023
Hey, man, you're
not allowed up here.

1059
01:11:45,025 --> 01:11:47,526
The DJ booth is a sacred space.

1060
01:11:54,534 --> 01:11:56,535
No. Tinkles, quiet.

1061
01:11:56,537 --> 01:11:58,070
Who is this?

1062
01:11:58,072 --> 01:12:02,473
Ha! I know you recognize me,
your greatest rival.

1063
01:12:02,475 --> 01:12:05,376
Hmm. Oh, right.

1064
01:12:05,378 --> 01:12:08,479
You own that Holiday Inn
down by the airport.

1065
01:12:08,481 --> 01:12:13,117
No! It is I,
Abraham Van Helsing.

1066
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:14,586
Van Helsing?

1067
01:12:14,588 --> 01:12:16,455
After all these years?

1068
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:18,360
You look awful.

1069
01:12:19,594 --> 01:12:22,561
Always with the quick insults.

1070
01:12:22,563 --> 01:12:25,097
Well, this will shut you up.

1071
01:12:25,099 --> 01:12:26,999
And all monsters.

1072
01:12:27,001 --> 01:12:31,036
Eh, huh? That's just Ericka's
family heirloom thingy.

1073
01:12:31,038 --> 01:12:33,539
Good one, Ericka.

1074
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:35,073
Ericka?

1075
01:12:35,075 --> 01:12:36,442
You fool.

1076
01:12:36,444 --> 01:12:39,311
Not only is she
the ship's captain,

1077
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,213
but she also happens
to be...

1078
01:12:43,551 --> 01:12:45,954
Wait. You tell him.

1079
01:12:47,587 --> 01:12:50,257
I'm his great-granddaughter.

1080
01:12:51,591 --> 01:12:54,326
I'm Ericka Van Helsing.

1081
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:57,329
I knew there was
something wrong with her.

1082
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:58,597
But...

1083
01:12:58,599 --> 01:13:01,400
See, what happened...

1084
01:13:01,402 --> 01:13:03,434
Now that we're all caught up,

1085
01:13:03,436 --> 01:13:06,272
let's get back to the dying.

1086
01:13:06,274 --> 01:13:11,677
Behold, the key to the demise
of all monsters.

1087
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:25,491
Let's see.

1088
01:13:25,493 --> 01:13:28,126
Right... Okay.

1089
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:33,365
Listen to the melody

1090
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:35,237
of your destruction.

1091
01:13:38,338 --> 01:13:40,705
Ooh, what's this little
doodad do?

1092
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:43,577
Yeah!

1093
01:14:06,033 --> 01:14:08,303
Hey, look! It's the Kraken.

1094
01:14:23,016 --> 01:14:24,351
Everybody out! Now!

1095
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:39,031
We're trapped! Everybody back!

1096
01:15:00,421 --> 01:15:02,356
Yay!

1097
01:15:09,797 --> 01:15:11,397
Baby!

1098
01:15:11,399 --> 01:15:13,064
Papa!

1099
01:15:23,277 --> 01:15:25,113
This has to stop now!

1100
01:15:26,279 --> 01:15:27,278
Drac, no!

1101
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,248
Ah!

1102
01:15:41,261 --> 01:15:42,361
Dad!

1103
01:15:43,764 --> 01:15:45,263
Mavis!

1104
01:15:45,265 --> 01:15:48,202
Time for the immortal Dracula
to die.

1105
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,446
Dad!

1106
01:16:06,487 --> 01:16:07,521
No!

1107
01:16:09,122 --> 01:16:10,157
Ericka!

1108
01:16:14,295 --> 01:16:15,561
Bob! Help!

1109
01:16:15,563 --> 01:16:16,765
Huh?

1110
01:16:20,167 --> 01:16:21,299
Tinkles?

1111
01:16:21,301 --> 01:16:22,468
Dennis.

1112
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:25,170
Oh, no.
Bob is Tinkles?

1113
01:16:25,172 --> 01:16:26,571
How did he get here?

1114
01:16:26,573 --> 01:16:28,575
But thank goodness he did,
'cause look!

1115
01:17:09,516 --> 01:17:10,781
You can't do this!

1116
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,619
You're wrong
about monsters!

1117
01:17:13,787 --> 01:17:16,655
Dracula... He saved my life.

1118
01:17:16,657 --> 01:17:17,923
What?

1119
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:19,790
I'm so sorry, Drac.

1120
01:17:19,792 --> 01:17:22,260
I was trying to kill you
this whole time,

1121
01:17:22,262 --> 01:17:24,830
but then I realized
how wrong I was.

1122
01:17:24,832 --> 01:17:26,868
How wrong all of this is.

1123
01:17:28,368 --> 01:17:30,235
And then I...

1124
01:17:30,237 --> 01:17:31,439
I Zinged.

1125
01:17:32,706 --> 01:17:34,639
"Zing"? What's a Zing?

1126
01:17:34,641 --> 01:17:35,907
It's a monster thing.

1127
01:17:35,909 --> 01:17:37,709
You wouldn't understand.

1128
01:17:37,711 --> 01:17:40,312
It's like true love.

1129
01:17:40,314 --> 01:17:41,379
Love?

1130
01:17:44,752 --> 01:17:47,518
Well, I guess the legacy
ends with me.

1131
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,454
Hmm, that's an awkward ending.

1132
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:50,656
Nope!

1133
01:17:50,658 --> 01:17:53,294
It's time to start
a new legacy.

1134
01:17:54,328 --> 01:17:56,798
A monster-human legacy.

1135
01:17:57,965 --> 01:17:59,397
No!

1136
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:09,575
Drac! Van Helsing's beats are
controlling the giant octopus thingy.

1137
01:18:09,577 --> 01:18:13,579
If there's one thing I hate,
it's an evil DJ.

1138
01:18:13,581 --> 01:18:16,484
We need positive energy!

1139
01:18:22,689 --> 01:18:25,823
Get ready for a DJ battle!

1140
01:18:25,825 --> 01:18:28,759
You just carry all that
stuff around with you?

1141
01:18:28,761 --> 01:18:31,964
Once a bar mitzvah DJ,
always a bar mitzvah DJ.

1142
01:18:31,966 --> 01:18:35,834
We're gonna use good music
to defeat his evil music.

1143
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:38,469
- What?
- Trust me, I know the tunes,

1144
01:18:38,471 --> 01:18:40,371
but you've got the power.

1145
01:18:40,373 --> 01:18:42,406
All right. Okay.

1146
01:18:42,408 --> 01:18:45,677
Opening song needs to
be off the shizak.

1147
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,782
Ooh, got it. Play this!

1148
01:18:51,484 --> 01:18:53,451
<i>♪ I'm picking up

1149
01:18:54,587 --> 01:18:57,289

01:18:57,291 --> 01:18:59,590

1151
01:18:59,592 --> 01:19:01,360

<i>♪ She's giving me...</i>

1157
01:19:08,836 --> 01:19:10,701
What is that noise?

1158
01:19:10,703 --> 01:19:13,537
<i>♪ I'm picking up
good vibrations</i>

1159
01:19:13,539 --> 01:19:15,273
<i>♪ She's giving me

1160
01:19:15,275 --> 01:19:16,674
Wow! I like this one.

1161
01:19:16,676 --> 01:19:18,509
This feels good.

1162
01:19:18,511 --> 01:19:20,579
<i>♪ Good vibrations ♪</i>

1163
01:19:20,581 --> 01:19:22,613
The fool.

1164
01:19:46,707 --> 01:19:49,640
Whoa! His music
is too powerful!

1165
01:19:49,642 --> 01:19:51,977
We're gonna need something
even more positive.

1166
01:19:51,979 --> 01:19:53,248
Now, Drac!

1167
01:20:01,689 --> 01:20:03,524
<i>♪ So don't worry</i>

1168
01:20:04,992 --> 01:20:06,525

1170
01:20:07,694 --> 01:20:10,362

<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh... ♪</i>

1176
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:22,874
I've had enough
of this nonsense!

1177
01:20:45,565 --> 01:20:48,900
Johnny, we need
the most brain-dominating,

1178
01:20:48,902 --> 01:20:52,670
toe-tappinating song in the
history of all the universe.

1179
01:20:56,042 --> 01:20:58,712
Come on.
Where is it?

1180
01:21:00,713 --> 01:21:02,848
I don't know!

1181
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:04,549
There's too many choices.

1182
01:21:07,087 --> 01:21:09,086
No, wait!

1183
01:21:09,088 --> 01:21:11,926
This is it.

1184
01:21:24,704 --> 01:21:26,004
What the...

1185
01:21:40,621 --> 01:21:42,489
Boy, that stinks.

1186
01:21:48,662 --> 01:21:51,028
It's working!

1187
01:21:57,805 --> 01:22:02,808
Hey, Johnny's corny music
is defeating the evil music.

1188
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:04,142
I kind of like it.

1189
01:22:04,144 --> 01:22:05,880
Ooh!

1190
01:22:26,566 --> 01:22:28,767
No!

1191
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:50,921
Argh! Ahhh! Whoo!

1192
01:22:50,923 --> 01:22:53,961
I'm a slave to the rhythm!

1193
01:23:00,167 --> 01:23:01,436
No!

1194
01:23:03,737 --> 01:23:05,670
Drac, what are you doing?

1195
01:23:05,672 --> 01:23:07,839
You got to be greater
than the haters!

1196
01:23:11,712 --> 01:23:13,481
Huh?

1197
01:23:23,623 --> 01:23:24,656
Why?

1198
01:23:24,658 --> 01:23:27,558
Why, after everything,

1199
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,693
would you save my life?

1200
01:23:29,695 --> 01:23:33,130
Because basically
we are all the same.

1201
01:23:33,132 --> 01:23:36,735
Claws or hands, two eyes
or three eyes.

1202
01:23:36,737 --> 01:23:38,769
- Green skin.
- No skin.

1203
01:23:38,771 --> 01:23:40,170
- Prickly.
- Brainy.

1204
01:23:45,846 --> 01:23:47,148
I'm sorry.

1205
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:56,021
Ew.

1206
01:23:56,023 --> 01:23:58,159
You are amazing.

1207
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:11,639
Look at me, Dennis.
Look at me.

1208
01:24:12,872 --> 01:24:15,639
Come on,
you can't deny it.

1209
01:24:15,641 --> 01:24:17,711
No! I'm too young
to Zing!

1210
01:24:22,649 --> 01:24:24,848
Well, I feel
kind of silly now.

1211
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:28,687
Heh. For decades
I have hunted your kind,

1212
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:30,287
persecuted you.

1213
01:24:33,327 --> 01:24:36,530
The only thing I can do
to make it up to you is

1214
01:24:37,764 --> 01:24:39,063
give you

1215
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:42,334
a 30% refund.

1216
01:24:42,336 --> 01:24:44,838
Preposterous!

1217
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:48,039
Oh, all right.

1218
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:49,240
Full refund.

1219
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,773
Wayne, Wanda,
what happened to you guys?

1220
01:25:22,775 --> 01:25:25,376
Yeah, we, like,
hardly saw you on the cruise.

1221
01:25:25,378 --> 01:25:27,678
Yeah, I know.

1222
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,647
We got tranquilized and spent most
of the trip locked in a closet.

1223
01:25:29,649 --> 01:25:32,353
We're gonna book it
again for the holidays.

1224
01:25:38,358 --> 01:25:39,857
Hi. Checking in?

1225
01:25:39,859 --> 01:25:41,893
Yes. Thank you.

1226
01:25:41,895 --> 01:25:43,864
Great. I have a room all ready for you.

1227
01:25:45,698 --> 01:25:47,866
Hey, buddy, would you mind?

1228
01:25:47,868 --> 01:25:48,970
Sure thing, pal.

1229
01:26:04,818 --> 01:26:08,719
Okay, what's going on,
sneaky pants?

1230
01:26:08,721 --> 01:26:10,754
Oh, nothing.

1231
01:26:10,756 --> 01:26:14,961
It's just, I wanted to make
sure nobody would bother us.

1232
01:26:15,796 --> 01:26:17,394
Oh! Why?

1233
01:26:17,396 --> 01:26:20,064
Are you going to suck-a my blood?
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1234
01:26:21,967 --> 01:26:23,768
No.

1235
01:26:23,770 --> 01:26:26,437
I was going to ask you

1236
01:26:26,439 --> 01:26:28,141
if you would marry me.

1237
01:26:33,145 --> 01:26:35,280
Well? What do you say?

1238
01:26:35,282 --> 01:26:36,816
Will you marry me?

1239
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:42,757
I... I...

1240
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:45,191
