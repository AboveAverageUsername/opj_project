2
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,035
He honestly doesn't seem to like you, Finstock.

3
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,750
He loves me. Do you know why?

4
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,311
He loves me, because I'm his master.

5
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,755
He knows I will protect him.

6
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,514
Like the students here
at Hamilton University. Sit!

7
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,875
They know why I'm here.

8
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,315
Finstock, do you know why you're here?

9
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,040
Yes, sir. 32.500 a year and summers off.

10
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,108
You're here because it's time to bring
the glory back to this institution.

11
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,840
The regional boxing finals
are in three months.

12
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,073
Now, you and I have a sacred oath

13
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,959
to provide these young people
with an opportunity

14
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,352
To develop not only their minds,
but their spirit as well.

15
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,513
Their fighting spirit. Am I right?

16
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,719
I promised the alumni
a winning boxing team

17
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,553
and all you've given me is this Todd Howard.

18
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,679
All he ever did on the field
was play in the school band.

19
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,398
Clarinet, looks like.

20
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,391
Can I make a sudden move?

21
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,950
That's the kid. His cousin Scott played
basketball for me at Beacontown High.

22
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,519
- And?
- And what?

23
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,830
"And what? And what?" What?!

24
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,233
I don't think Scott knew the first thing
about playing the clarinet.

25
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,836
I gave that kid a full scholarship
based on your recommendation.

26
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,389
On my recommendation? That's great.

27
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,518
- Finstock!
- What?

28
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,513
Your job is riding on this boxing team.

29
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,148
And so is my reputation as an educator.

30
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,636
And all you brought me is a clarinet player?

31
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,633
- I think it's that way.
- OK. Three blocks?

32
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,439
Todd! Todd!

33
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,397
- Thanks a lot.
- Bye.

34
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,313
- Come on, Todd. Let's go.
- Excuse me.

35
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,750
She said the dorm was past the quad
and left after the administration building.

36
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,435
- Or was it right?
- We'll just keep going straight.

37
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,115
I know how you feel.

38
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,670
College is a stressful time.
Especially on your first day.

39
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,870
I mean, it's stressful for anyone.

40
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,715
Even for people without your particular worry.

41
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,833
- What worry?
- You know.

42
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,675
I don't believe it.

43
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,678
Wow!

44
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,035
Absolutely, I mean...

45
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,191
I hate it when you do that.

46
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,148
I'm not ashamed of what I am
and you shouldn't be either.

47
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,517
I'm not, because it skipped my family.

48
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,154
No, I've got enough problems.
I'm here at a new school.

49
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,872
I gotta make new friends and try
to fit in without this hanging over me.

50
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,677
It is true that sometimes it skips family members.

51
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,832
Your mother and father aren't werewolves.

52
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,676
But if I were you,
I'd keep my possibilities open.

53
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,589
Uncle Harold, can you please
change back before we get to the dorm?

54
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,149
Thanks.

55
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,759
I think the dorm is a little north from here.

56
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,195
Watch out!

57
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,110
Phew!

58
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,517
Excuse me, I think that this was our space.

59
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,756
- Are you talking to me?
- No, but...

60
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,196
...I'd like to maybe give you a call.

61
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,876
- Gus, he says this is his space.
- A freshman.

62
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,109
Did you think I said that this was my space?
I didn't say that. No.

63
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,829
This is your space.
My space has yellow lines on it.

64
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,357
I brought my uncle by to see your space,
because it's so nice.

65
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,230
And now since you're in your space,
we'll get in ours.

66
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,358
- They seem like nice kids.
- I saw another space up the street.

67
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,353
Todd? Buddy, how are you? Come on in.

68
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,717
Drop your stuff off. Make yourself at home.

69
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,716
- Do I... know you?
- Stiles. We're roommates.

70
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,270
- Stiles?
- Mr. H?

71
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,830
- Stiles!
- Mr. H! How's the prince of paint?

72
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,630
- What are you doing here?
- Connections. Daughter of somebody.

73
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,870
Let me just tidy up a bit.

74
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,228
It's a great room, huh?
I decorated it myself.

75
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,393
Well, what do you think?
You're in the big time, kid. College.

76
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,588
No one telling you what to do.
No more picking up your stuff. No parents.

77
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,877
No offence, Mr. H. Let me help you with that.

78
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,672
- Todd?
- Yeah?

79
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,513
- Will you walk me to the van?
- Sure.

80
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,797
Everything is kosher.
I've taken care of everything.

81
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,316
I've got Todd's year at college all mapped out.

82
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,037
For the drive home.

83
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,273
Todd?

84
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,876
Thanks. You got any fries?

85
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,476
- See you in a bit.
- We are gonna have a great year.

86
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,757
- I think so.
- I've got them vibes happening.

87
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,512
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

88
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,715
In a big way.

89
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,039
- Hey.
- Todd, I...

90
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,476
Listen, Uncle Harold,
everything's gonna be fine.

91
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,916
Once I start those science classes,
I'll really like it here.

92
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,230
But what about that sports scholarship?

93
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,951
The closest you ever came to an athletic field
was playing clarinet in the marching band.

94
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,669
Once they take a look at me,
they won't want me on any team.

95
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,831
They ain't gonna give you
something for nothing.

96
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,798
Well, I guess that's their problem.

97
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,436
- Don't forget your groceries.
- Oh yeah, thanks.

98
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,433
I promised your mum and dad
to look after you.

99
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,512
I didn't expect
to find Stiles as your roommate.

100
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,274
He seems OK.

101
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,753
Stiles was Scott's best friend
in high school. He knows all about us.

102
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,559
Well, I figure since I'm not a...

103
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,550
Since I don't have the family problem,
there's nothing to worry about.

104
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,950
I'm sure you'll be OK. Hey, listen...

105
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,715
- What are you doing?
- Take this. You never know.

106
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,549
- Well, take care.
- Yeah.

107
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,154
What?

108
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,313
- If you need anything, you call me.
- I will.

109
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,678
- OK.
- Thanks, Uncle Harold. Take it easy.

110
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,398
Call me.

111
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,353
All right, all right. I'll see you later.

112
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,673
<i>En garde!</i>

113
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,558
No mercy!

114
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,914
Ha, ha, ha!

115
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,715
Hey! Take it easy.

116
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,313
Die!

117
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,108
- He's nuts!
- Sorry.

118
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,712
Chocolate milk.

119
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,156
Grab the door for me?

120
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,959
- Todd, Chubby. Chub, Todd.
- Hi.

121
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,634
Chub played basketball
at Beacontown, Todd.

122
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,030
- So you know my cousin?
- Scott.

123
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,512
- We just love the Howard family.
- Stiles, where is all my stuff?

124
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,036
Some of my T-shirts are in there,
but help yourself. I don't mind.

125
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,070
What did you mean when you said
you've taken care of everything?

126
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,834
All your classes. I registered for you.

127
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,919
You what? I've already pre-registered.

128
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,710
I know. I saw what you picked.
I made the necessary changes. Trust me.

129
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,676
- This is all wrong. Girls' volleyball?
- Good class.

130
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,195
Candle making? French for chefs?

131
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,830
<i>C'est très magnifique. </i>
It's a good class. I'm taking it again.

132
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,710
- There's not one science class on here.
- Science?

133
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,871
You don't understand.

134
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,358
That boy's got werewolf written all over him.

135
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,798
If everything goes as planned,
he and I are gonna take the school by storm.

136
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,475
I love college. I love it.

137
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,391
- I gotta get these changed.
- Don't make me laugh, kid.

138
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,279
Rules are rules. Policy is policy.

139
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,194
- This has got to be changed.
- You've got a lot of nerve.

140
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,238
Nobody ever changes their classes.

141
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,350
What do you want?

142
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,310
- I...
- Well? Well?

143
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,472
Come on, I haven't got all day.

144
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,270
I'd like... to change... some classes.

145
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,470
Have your professor sign this
and bring it back here. But not to me.

146
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,950
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

147
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,709
It's not as tough as it looks.

148
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,430
- I'm looking for Professor Brooks.
- She's not in there.

149
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,429
I was wondering if you could tell me
where she might be?

150
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,309
Professor Brooks is
both omnivorous and bipedal.

151
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,712
She's also a <i>homo sapiens femininus. </i>

152
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,713
And a brilliant one at that.

153
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,718
- I'm Tanya Brooks. Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Todd... Howard.

154
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,590
- Howard, yes. I know all about you.
- You do?

155
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,558
I'm your faculty advisor.
I read your application.

156
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,154
Your talent for science
is very impressive.

157
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,710
I was surprised that you're here
on an athletic scholarship.

158
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,159
Surprised me too.
I have a favor to ask you.

159
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,993
I wanna be a veterinarian
and I need your class.

160
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,312
I know registration is over,
but could you see it my way?

161
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,075
- Yes?
- You're in my class. It's not full yet.

162
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,869
- As your advisor, I'll make an exception.
- Really? Thank you.

163
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,429
Thank you very much.

164
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,117
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking for <i>lubrus protozoa. </i>.

165
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,838
Let's see.

166
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,113
Here it is, right here.

167
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,149
There's nothing on this.

168
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,118
It sort of helps if you turn it on.

169
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,752
See you.

170
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,593
- I need to speak to a coach.
- You're Todd Howard.

171
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,672
- Yeah.
- We're all depending on you.

172
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,550
- Depending on me for what?
- Hey, you missed a spot.

173
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,748
I had a kid once who had
an athletic scholarship just like you.

174
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,229
A gifted athlete.

175
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,518
But he had this crazy dream
about wanting to become a chiropractor.

176
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,990
But he had to work all night at this diner.

177
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,676
Because he was supporting his sister
and she had three kids.

178
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,709
- And his name was Philip. No wait.
- Doesn't matter.

179
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,633
It sorta does. His name was George.

180
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,519
Her three kids were really nice,

181
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,672
but one had two thumbs on his right hand.

182
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,678
So did he become a chiropractor?

183
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,752
Not with two thumbs
on his right hand, he didn't.

184
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,357
Wait a minute.
You're from Beacontown, aren't you?

185
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,431
Yeah.

186
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,195
Now I get it. You think that I'm...

187
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,640
You can forget it. I'm not Scott.
I can't do what Scott did.

188
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,314
What's a five-letter word
for "Italian sausage"?

189
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,472
So that's why they gave me
a sports scholarship.

190
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,714
So what? Go a few rounds in the ring,
get your head knocked off. Maybe.

191
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,155
You get your scholarship
and everybody's happy.

192
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,438
- Jump into what ring?
- Just show up for practice this Thursday.

193
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,955
- Practice for what?
- Boxing.

194
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,949
"Frank". That's perfect.

195
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,874
Would you take it easy?

196
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,558
I wanna keep this scholarship
and I don't know what I'm doing.

197
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,154
Fat kid's a great dancer.

198
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,594
All right.

199
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,155
OK, you wanna play rough?

200
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,788
I'll throw two jabs. Come back with a right.

201
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,193
- Which one's the Howard kid?
- Hey, Todd.

202
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,108
I guess he's a little rusty.

203
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:31,715
If this is some kind of joke,
you'll notice I'm not laughing.

204
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,797
- I had dibs on this.
- Possession is nine tenths of the law.

205
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,599
So now you're a lawyer?
Thought you were a biologist.

206
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,356
What do you want with it anyway?
It's probably over your head.

207
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,229
- Over my head?
- Over any jock's head.

208
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,879
Jock?

209
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,993
Listen, I just wanna go to this school,
but I'm here on a sports scholarship

210
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,993
with a coach who wants me
to have two right thumbs.

211
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,472
My roommate sunbathes with a light bulb,
some fat kid eats all my food.

212
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,598
I've got Dean Dunn's dog
trying to bite my leg off.

213
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,638
- And you want the only book that I want?
- Shh!

214
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,832
Well, I'll tell you what. You can have
this book and this book and this book.

215
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,877
- And keep that book as well.
- Shh!

216
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,393
You too, buddy.

217
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,073
- You OK?
- Yeah.

218
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,598
- Here. You want this more than I do.
- Thanks.

219
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,317
I... I guess I got a little carried away in there.

220
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,557
I guess you did.

221
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,632
Hey, wait up.

222
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,758
"Phylum and Genus Classes
in North American Crustaceans"?

223
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,876
Little light reading for you, huh?

224
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,916
I should have known
that I'd find you in the science section.

225
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,711
I probably won't be needing
this book anyway.

226
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,876
- I was science fair champion...
... in the tri-county area.

227
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,634
My research is
in crustacean reproduction.

228
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,552
How exciting.

229
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,635
- How's your schedule?
- It's better.

230
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,268
Listen, Nicki...

231
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,029
...I was wondering if, well...

232
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,149
- Would you like to...
- I'd love to.

233
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,276
- You would?
- Sure.

234
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,839
Great.

235
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,078
I'm busy Friday, but Saturday I'm free.

236
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,036
Do lab partners work on the weekends
this early in the semester?

237
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,150
Oh...

238
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:50,112
- I thought you were asking me if...
- Really? Oh...

239
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,991
Well, then you mean you'd like to?
I mean, maybe...

240
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,469
Maybe we can.

241
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,429
Hi.

242
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,717
- Bye.
- Bye-bye. Bye.

243
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,598
- Hi.
- Hi.

244
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,357
- About earlier...
- Don't worry. It's nothing.

245
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,117
- Thanks. You look nice.
- Thank you.

246
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,078
- You wanna dance?
- Sure.

247
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,789
- How's that left hook?
- It's great.

248
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:56,437
Todd Howard, I'd like you to meet
Mrs. St. Claire, one of our benefactors.

249
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,357
The new physics lab, Lennock field
and other endowments.

250
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,873
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you.

251
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:09,194
I'd like you also to meet
Lisa Goldfluss and Emily Lord.

252
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,352
They are co-hostesses
of our reception committee.

253
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,715
We've met.

254
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,830
This fine young man carries
our hopes and dreams into the ring.

255
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,036
Lisa, dance with Todd.

256
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,033
- Dean Dunn, I really...
- Do it.

257
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,553
What are you smiling at? You're next.

258
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,551
How's your boyfriend?

259
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,158
I may have to dance with you,
but I don't have to talk to you.

260
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,838
Hey.

261
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,755
- You sure do sweat a lot.
- Shut up and dance.

262
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:51,355
Oh no. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

263
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,238
Oh my... You're a dog.
I've been dancing with a dog.

264
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,393
- Yeah, I knew you had it in you.
- Hey, look out!

265
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,588
Dip!

266
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,194
Let me give you a hand with that.

267
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,869
Miss Goldfluss, do you
have an explanation for this?

268
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,149
- What are you so upset about?
- Upset, Stiles? Me, upset?

269
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,709
I had a beard all over my body.

270
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,555
Fingernails the size of French fries.
Teeth from here to Texas.

271
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,359
And she called me a dog. A dog!

272
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,637
OK, I might be able to cut you a deal.

273
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,873
If they let you keep the scholarship,
you become the school mascot.

274
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,077
- Yeah?
- This is just the tip of the iceberg.

275
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,231
Everybody will be talking about you.

276
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,915
All you gotta do is be the wolf, Todd.
I'll do the rest.

277
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,438
Wonderful. Wonderful.
She called me a dog.

278
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,273
The bed they laid him in
was only six feet long.

279
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,673
His feet hung over the end.

280
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,630
Mary, his wife, clung to his side.

281
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,271
Her tears mingled with his blood.

282
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,389
Her prayers echoed the grief
of an entire nation.

283
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:42,032
The small projectile from the derringer
that John Wilkes Booth used

284
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,670
- was lodged in his left temple.
- I've got fleas. You distract him.

285
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,393
And all night long the vigil waited
in that small boarding house

286
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,076
across from Ford's Theatre
until the wee hours in the morning.

287
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,231
When fate dealt that final blow...

288
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,997
...a crowd of mourners gathered,

289
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,951
white, black, rich and poor.

290
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:20,389
And so, ten hours after that fatal shot,
President Abraham Lincoln...

291
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,189
Mr. Howard, where are you going? Mr. Howard.

292
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,191
Ah! Ah! Ah!

293
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,756
Todd Howard. I've been wanting
to speak with you, young man.

294
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,435
Your disruptive behavior
at yesterday's reception

295
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,478
warrants my personal attention,
don't you think?

296
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,192
I don't like practical jokes.
I am not a funny man.

297
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,273
I fail to see the humor
of dressing up in a dog costume

298
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,034
- and trying to frighten our alumni.
- But Dean Dunn...

299
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,397
Don't give me any of that backtalk.

300
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,358
If you're trying to push me...

301
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,193
...you have no idea who you're dealing with.

302
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,712
Your first fight is coming up.
So far I'm unimpressed.

303
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,350
You'd better not fail me, because if you do,

304
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,479
I'll call every dean at every school

305
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,189
and you'll never go to college, anywhere, ever.

306
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,636
Do I make myself crystal clear?

307
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,876
Oh!

308
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,753
Strange boy.

309
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,191
Excuse me.

310
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,913
The guy that turned into a dog,
what's his problem?

311
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,469
He's really weird.

312
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,200
Everybody's scratching around here.

313
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,595
Todd, we're looking forward
to your presentation. Are you ready?

314
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,229
Yeah, I think so.

315
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,470
Todd, I wanna see you.
That's all for today. Thank you.

316
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,719
- Do you wanna go to lunch?
- You don't wanna be seen with a dog.

317
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,556
- Do you wanna go to lunch, or not?
- I've gotta go see the professor.

318
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,837
They're giving you a hard time, aren't they?

319
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,754
- I'm your advisor. Maybe I can help.
- I don't think so.

320
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,471
Well, I'd like to try. You have a talent
for science. Let's start with that.

321
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,792
No matter what anyone says or does,
don't lose sight of your goals.

322
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,633
I wanted to study hard
and become a veterinarian.

323
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,998
I can help you with that.
You're a very bright young man, Todd.

324
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,993
You'll find a way to deal
with your other problems.

325
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,230
If you only knew, Professor Brooks.

326
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,717
I'll do my very best to try and understand.

327
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,112
- I'm always here if you need me.
- OK.

328
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,955
Hope you're hungry.
I've got a ton of stuff here.

329
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,509
- You like chicken, don't you?
- Why are you doing this?

330
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,750
'Cause I'm hungry.

331
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,910
- Drumstick?
- You know what I mean.

332
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:50,154
Biologically speaking it's absolutely fascinating
what's happened to you.

333
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,550
If you think I'm gonna
feel sorry for you, forget it.

334
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,234
But I'm a dog.

335
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,551
You'll be OK. You will.

336
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,431
One, two, three. You're out of here.
Bring the doctor in here.

337
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:00,595
- How many does that make?
- Three for them. None for us.

338
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,433
You're up next, big guy.

339
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,673
- But coach, this isn't my weight class.
- That'll be my problem. Go on.

340
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,112
Hey, what if I..?

341
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,632
- He outweighs my guy by 50 pounds.
- It's all water weight, look at him.

342
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,751
Look tough, Chubby.

343
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,113
Let's box.

344
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,589
Hey, what are you doing?

345
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,035
- Put him down.
- Put him down.

346
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,794
- Put me down.
- I'm warning you.

347
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,949
All right. Let's box.

348
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,351
- You pig.
- Come on.

349
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,479
- Come on.
- No more. Let's box.

350
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,873
Use your weight, Chub.

351
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,634
OK. Break. Break.

352
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,193
Get over there.

353
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,673
Hamilton!

354
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,073
That's the last fight you win.

355
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,270
All right, Chubby.

356
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,191
All right. Let's take him.
Get out there, babe.

357
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,678
OK, get in there.

358
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,191
OK, let's box!

359
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,357
Next.

360
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,592
Next.

361
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,315
Don't worry. There's a good hospital on campus.

362
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,916
Let's get this over with.
I've got a date in a half hour.

363
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,115
This makes or breaks your career.

364
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,750
Let's go, Pug.

365
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,388
- You're gonna die.
- I know.

366
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,311
Move, move, move!

367
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,398
Knock him out!

368
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,509
Great move.

369
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,434
I'll break your kneecaps
if you don't keep still and let me hit you.

370
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,718
Come on, Pug.

371
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,955
- All right.
- Yeah!

372
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,509
All right. Get back. Come on.

373
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,557
You're history.

374
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,836
I knew Pug would win that fight.

375
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,071
- You OK, kid? One...
- Todd, get up. Come on.

376
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,958
Don't lie there like a fish.

377
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,393
Three.

378
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,398
Four.

379
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,832
Five.

380
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,148
Holy shit!

381
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,675
Yeah!

382
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,436
- What is this?
- It's that dog you were dancing with.

383
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,071
- Do you wanna stop the fight?
- Hell no. Go on.

384
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,468
All right. Box.

385
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,476
Stay away from him, Pug.

386
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,789
Nail him, Todd. Nail him.

387
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,071
Pug, come on!

388
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,716
Get in there and kill him!

389
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,636
A right hook. He can fight.

390
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,192
Murder him!

391
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,473
- Pug!
- You're out.

392
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,038
Yeah! Yeah!

393
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,952
Yeehaw!

394
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,998
Have no fear, Stiles is here.
OK, we're gonna rock.

395
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,837
Brewskies are coming. We're gonna
have a party and have so much fun.

396
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,433
- What are you waiting for?
- We need music!

397
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,034
Is this thing on? Can you hear me?

398
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,990
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a very special guest with us.

399
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:43,392
Not only does our Teen Wolf
throw a punch like lightning,

400
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,391
but he sings too.

401
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,876
Yeah, we've arrived.

402
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:12,551
Look what I've got,
boys and girls of all ages.

403
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,717
Come and see Stiles.
I've got the stuff for you.

404
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,110
I got T-shirts, anything you want.

405
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,552
Break, break!

406
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,158
The championship is two weeks away.
It's down to you and that wolf.

407
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,719
Any predictions?

408
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,077
Every dog has his day. And his is mine.

409
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,513
Hello?

410
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,755
- Emily.
- Stiles.

411
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,071
- Go away.
- What?

412
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,231
You don't mind, do you, buddy?

413
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,670
Lisa...

414
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,798
- Hey, Todd.
- Stiles, beat it.

415
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,598
Chubby.

416
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,678
Chubby? Chub?

417
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,110
Chubby?

418
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:33,995
- Chubby.
- What?

419
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,234
I've created a monster.

420
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,558
Mmm...

421
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,471
Hmm?

422
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,710
That smell is disgusting.

423
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,116
OK, so I was absent
the day you guys did this.

424
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,398
- Are you mad at me?
- Ha!

425
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,630
- You're jealous.
- What?

426
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,715
Of those two leeches you hang around with?
You can't even see it, can you?

427
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,916
They don't like you, only the wolf.

428
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,119
Look, just because everything
is going great for me

429
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,192
doesn't give you the right
to go off and start...

430
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,275
- You just hit me with a dead frog.
- Jerk.

431
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,919
Jerk?

432
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,999
Frog fight!

433
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,075
Incoming!

434
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,312
What is going on here?
Frog fighting in my lab?

435
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,630
Put those things away.

436
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,280
That's the end of class for today.

437
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,356
Except for you.

438
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,556
I wanna talk to you.

439
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,669
I've been talking with your other professors.

440
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:57,436
I know about the car, your grades
and how you're coasting through.

441
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:03,516
When you have a gift,
you have a responsibility to use it wisely.

442
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,514
You're not. And you're
only letting yourself down.

443
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:13,992
- Are you in a hurry?
- Actually, I have to get to practice.

444
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,639
Team's nothing without the wolf.

445
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,509
You can't expect the wolf
to solve all your problems.

446
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,638
You do realize
you have finals coming up, don't you?

447
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,271
- Yeah, regional finals?
- No, course finals.

448
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:35,315
Listen, I don't think I need this class.

449
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,948
You told me to choose the right path.

450
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,476
And with the road that I've chosen...

451
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,870
...I don't think I need biology at all.

452
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,549
I'm very sorry to hear that.

453
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,230
You waited for me?

454
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,076
I don't know why.

455
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,229
I never thought I'd say it,

456
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,516
but I miss the old Todd.

457
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,752
What happened?

458
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,157
- He turned into a werewolf.
- But that's not the real you.

459
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:27,677
The wolf lets me do what I wanna do. It's a gift.

460
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,559
- I have a responsibility to myself...
- Responsibility?

461
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:35,589
What about school? Or being a veterinarian?
What about you and me?

462
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,593
My feelings for you are real.
They have nothing to do with the wolf.

463
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,797
Those others could care less about the real you.

464
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,713
Look, I'm late and you're wrong.

465
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,988
That's the way it's done, girls.

466
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,799
Watch this.

467
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,509
We'll play through.

468
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,795
How can you take him seriously?
He's a freshman.

469
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,156
With an awful lot of hair.

470
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,313
Why don't you shut your mouth?

471
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,631
- Let's settle this man to man.
- I don't fight chipmunks.

472
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,836
Not here, Gus.

473
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,550
What are you doing?

474
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,677
Where are you going?

475
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,558
You die in the ring, pal.

476
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,992
Fore!

477
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,432
It's in the hole.

478
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,796
You guys studying?

479
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:51,478
Yes, some of us
actually have to take finals.

480
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,916
Mr. Stilinsky...

481
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,913
...what say you, me and the wolf

482
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,389
take the wheels for a little...

483
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,553
...spin?

484
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,029
- Nope.
- Huh, huh?

485
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,955
How about you, big guy?
I might even let you drive.

486
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,997
What do you say?

487
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,588
I'm busy. OK?

488
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,358
- See you, Stiles.
- See you, Chub.

489
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:41,557
- Check 46.
- You know what's funny?

490
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,951
I wanted you to become the wolf
more than anybody else.

491
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:48,556
So I guess I'm partly to blame
for what you've become.

492
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,558
What have I become?

493
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,995
- A jerk, Todd.
- Aw...

494
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,914
Thank you for coming. I...

495
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,514
I really need to talk to you.

496
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,990
- You're in a tough spot, huh?
- Yeah.

497
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,635
I just let it get out of hand.

498
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:05,388
I mean, I know you... you warned me.

499
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,638
And I guess I should've listened, because...

500
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,599
...I got a little crazy, Uncle Harold,
and I ended up hurting

501
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,469
a lot of people that I really care about.

502
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,756
What are you gonna do about it?

503
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,871
I don't know.

504
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,035
I really don't know.

505
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,078
Well, don't be too tough on yourself.

506
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:39,199
After all, you're only human too.

507
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,151
So?

508
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:46,393
So you made a mistake.
You admitted it. It's over.

509
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:50,599
Maybe it's time you were Todd Howard again.

510
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,751
I'm scared.

511
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,752
Really scared.

512
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:03,438
If I'm myself in this ring tomorrow,
I could get killed.

513
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,955
I don't think you're gonna get killed.

514
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:11,238
This guy's really big. He's huge.

515
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,356
Never mind him.

516
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:18,196
'Cause what I'm interested in is you
and what you've got right there.

517
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,835
What does that matter
when the guy is twice your size?

518
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,232
- Well...
- I wouldn't stand a chance.

519
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,550
Maybe not.

520
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:38,635
But sometimes you have to make
a stand. Even if you don't want to.

521
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,031
- What's that?
- Boxing gloves. They used to belong to me.

522
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:47,149
- In college I used to box, too.
- Really?

523
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:51,791
Yeah, I can show you some moves
nobody's seen in 30 years.

524
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,110
- Now when's this big match?
- Tomorrow.

525
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,759
Plenty of time.

526
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,594
- What are you doing?
- Studying.

527
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:33,909
I still have two more finals.
I guess you wouldn't know about that.

528
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,110
Nicki...

529
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,271
...I'm real sorry.

530
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,038
For everything.

531
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:53,479
- I guess the wolf makes you a jerk.
- No, I'm a jerk.

532
01:03:55,720 --> 01:04:00,794
I just hope that there's still time
to make up for it all.

533
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:14,153
- There's still time to try.
- I wanna try.

534
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:17,517
You can start by saying you're really sorry

535
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,558
for mistreating someone you like.

536
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,235
I'm sorry for mistreating someone...

537
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,595
...I really love.

538
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:40,357
- You missed your final.
- What?

539
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:44,479
Your final.
I'm sure Professor Brooks flunked you.

540
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,835
Oh? Yeah.

541
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,471
- Maybe we could talk to her.
- Yeah.

542
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,910
- Professor Brooks? Hi.
- Hi.

543
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:03,231
We were just coming to see you.

544
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,756
Listen, I know
I probably don't deserve it, but...

545
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:11,596
...if you would give me a second chance,
I'd really like to earn my grade.

546
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,038
You can take a make up exam
tomorrow at noon at the latest.

547
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,113
I have to turn the grades in
by the end of the day.

548
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:25,798
- I have a fight at three.
- The test takes three hours.

549
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,396
- Take it or leave it.
- We'll take it.

550
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,630
Yeah, thank you very much.

551
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,439
It's time.

552
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:24,198
- Good luck on your test.
- Thanks.

553
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,237
And at the match.

554
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:32,476
- Will you come see me box?
- Yeah.

555
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,949
- Good luck.
- Bye.

556
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:39,557
Well, that's the best I could do.

557
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,995
I missed a few classes.

558
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:51,878
It looks like you did well enough
to pass the course.

559
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,553
Great.

560
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:57,710
Professor Brooks,

561
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:02,317
I really wanna thank you for trying to help

562
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,233
when things got a little crazy.

563
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,077
Welcome back.

564
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,831
- Where have you been?
- Taking a final.

565
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,319
Where's the wolf?

566
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:40,234
You got to go fight in the 145 pound class now.

567
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,074
That's Peter's weight class.

568
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:49,268
- Yeah, so what?
- Look coach, we are a team.

569
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:55,714
We're gonna fight as a team.
And I am going up against Gus.

570
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,598
That's great.

571
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:03,675
All of you go and get your brains
knocked out. That'll be attractive.

572
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,395
White!

573
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,473
Yeah!

574
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,909
This is only the beginning.
From here we go to the state finals.

575
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,356
Then the nationals. The Olympics!

576
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,751
Remember, this is only your first year.

577
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,071
What you've gotta do, is fight and win.

578
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:22,633
I'll take care of the rest.
Grades, cars, money, women.

579
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,794
It'll be our little secret.

580
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:36,713
I hope you don't have any funny ideas
about not fighting as the wolf.

581
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,348
Oh no.

582
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,798
Remember, I still run this school.

583
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,394
I hold your scholarship.

584
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,437
Give 'em hell, kid.

585
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,594
OK, Peter. Peter, you're next. Go on up.

586
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,637
Sorry, I'm busy right now.

587
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:41,475
I know what you're doing.
I know about the car...

588
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,359
...the grades and the promises.

589
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,715
And I want you to lay off.

590
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,793
Todd Howard has a future here,
but it's not in the ring.

591
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:55,476
Who do you think you're talking to?
He'll do exactly as I say.

592
01:13:55,640 --> 01:14:00,839
- You don't own him.
- Is this your idea of a threat?

593
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,151
No... this is.

594
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:18,790
You don't know who you're dealing with.

595
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,716
- Yeah!
- Chubby, come on!

596
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,677
Box!

597
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,237
Cut. He's out.

598
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:49,155
Let him go. Come on.
Put him down.

599
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:53,154
Put him down so I can count.
Let's go. Come on.

600
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,595
He's out.

601
01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:01,630
All right, Chubby!
Come on out, dude.

602
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,399
Chubby, Chubby!

603
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,792
Ladies and gentlemen!

604
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:19,915
Welcome to the
Hamilton University Memorial Arena.

605
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,595
Now entering the arena,

606
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:29,754
three-time state champion
from the Nimitz Academy

607
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,957
weighing in at 200 pounds

608
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,998
Steve "Gus" Gustavson!

609
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:40,912
Boo!

610
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,435
Yeah! All right!

611
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,876
Steve "Gus" Gustavson!

612
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:53,599
Yeah, yeah, number one! Come on, yeah!

613
01:16:53,760 --> 01:17:00,916
Now entering the arena, weighing in
at 195 wild and woolly pounds,

614
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:05,278
Hamilton's own Todd "The Wolf" Howard!

615
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,836
Wolf, wolf, wolf, wolf!

616
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,630
Todd "The Wolf" Howard.

617
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:40,873
Where's the wolf?

618
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:47,234
Hey, where's the wolf?

619
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:51,393
What's he doing?
Come on. Are you crazy?

620
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:56,277
- Come on!
- Oh man!

621
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:00,556
- What is the meaning of this?
- Tactics?

622
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:03,439
I'll have him kicked out of this college.

623
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,911
Dean Dunn?

624
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:13,359
I won't be needing these anymore.
It's my last fight.

625
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,353
Good. I hope he kills you.

626
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:18,868
He probably will.

627
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,600
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Are you kidding?

628
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,637
Pays to be positive, big guy.

629
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:28,675
Box!

630
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,430
He made such a great wolf.

631
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,590
Kill him, Todd!

632
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:54,795
Come on. Hit me. Come on.

633
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:58,475
Come on. Hit me. Come on.

634
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,518
Come on. Hit me.

635
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,473
My grandmother hits harder than that.
Take that.

636
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,269
Come on.

637
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,078
Good round.

638
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:24,438
- Come on. Try that with me, you freak.
- Come on. Come on.

639
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,797
- Let go of me.
- Calm down. Round's over. Get back.

640
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:30,952
Back. I'm warning you.

641
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,112
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.

642
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,191
Cut the ring off on him.

643
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,435
How are you doing?
Are you feeling OK? Keep 'em up.

644
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:03,229
- How's the ribs?
- Chubby.

645
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,072
- How's the jaw?
- Ow!

646
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:08,710
- I'm sorry I called the wolf a jerk.
- I was a jerk.

647
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,872
If you don't turn back into the jerk,
we're gonna get killed.

648
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,554
It's gotta be this way.

649
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:17,996
Coach, you got anything to say to me?

650
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,832
Well, um...

651
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,753
...no.

652
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:28,829
- Go and kick some butt, Todd.
- Take him out.

653
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,434
Break, break.

654
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:39,838
- Step back.
- He's a baby. Come on.

655
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,911
Let's box.

656
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,512
Come on, get up.

657
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,035
- Come on.
- Ow! Ow!

658
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:05,036
- Break.
- Let go of me, you sissy.

659
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:08,510
Let him go. Break. Break, I said. Box.

660
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,317
Get him. Go ahead.

661
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,790
Come on. Come on!

662
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,669
Sit down.

663
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,753
- That's an early bell.
- Oh God.

664
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,071
Come on, ref. Keep your eyes open.

665
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:06,595
Now listen.

666
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:10,275
Unless you wanna wolf out,
I suggest we throw in the towel.

667
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:11,668
I'm not quitting.

668
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,796
Todd!

669
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,549
It's not as bad as it looks.

670
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:35,637
You're way ahead on points.
Keep fighting the same fight.

671
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:39,076
Look at his face over there.
That guy's in trouble.

672
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:42,118
You got it? Go! Get him!

673
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,748
Touch gloves. Last round. Box.

674
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:55,594
Go, Todd, go!

675
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,193
Do it!

676
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:14,678
- I'm gonna make you howl with pain.
- It's gonna be a long night.

677
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,992
Come on.
