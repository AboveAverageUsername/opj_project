{2668}{2727}Every night, the same dream.
{2727}{2768}The same strange planet.
{2780}{2812}But why?
{2819}{2864}What are they trying to tell you?
{3019}{3090}lt has been 34 years since|they arrived in this planet.
{3090}{3132}And now the days passes,
{3132}{3201}the survivors forced|to live in a barrier cities.
{3201}{3241}Do not live in fear.
{3241}{3299}l have vowed to the end that fear.
{3299}{3360}l believe my dreams hold the key.
{3360}{3396}The question is,
{3396}{3468}Will l be in time to save the Earth?
{6166}{6204}Where are you?
{10700}{10746}This is a restricted area.
{10746}{10780}Do not move!
{10780}{10815}What is she doing here,|captain?
{10815}{10860}l don't know,|but we are getting her out.
{10860}{10903}You're coming with us.
{10909}{10945}Behind you!

{11019}{11039}Damn it!

{11283}{11305}Alright, hold your fire.
{11424}{11462}Ryan, Neil, let's go.
{11603}{11628}What the hell do|you think you are doing?
{11628}{11660}There is a life form in here.
{11660}{11697}There hasn't been life here in years.
{11697}{11721}There is now.
{11721}{11853}Life form or not, l'm not leaving|without that life form.
{11929}{11965}Gonna be one of those days.
{12339}{12409}Captain, principal is not going to|wait any much longer.
{12409}{12438}l understand that.
{12438}{12483}lt's in bad shape.
{12490}{12568}Please. Tell me when l am risking|for this plant.
{12572}{12621}l won't even call it a plant.|lt's wheat.
{12621}{12656}l won't even call it a wheat.
{12656}{12713}l need a minute to extract it.
{12713}{12766}Miss, that's the minute we do not have.
{12766}{12809}l'm afraid his right about that, ma'am.
{12865}{12907}Captain, ww have incomings.
{12907}{12955}Captain, we need to get out from here.
{12955}{12983}Understood, sergeant.
{12983}{13015}Could you hurry please, miss?
{13015}{13036}Done, captain.
{13036}{13051}Yes, Neil.
{13051}{13110}Just all you know, l agree with.|Let's get out from here.
{13208}{13251}Can l have this please?|Thank you.
{13444}{13465}We're surrounded.
{13465}{13491}No! Shit!
{13553}{13587}Alright, everybody.|Just relax.
{13587}{13627}Captain, we got to get to higher ground.
{13627}{13661}Everyone, up to top.
{13727}{13757}Go! Go! Go!
{13859}{13903}Transport requesting immediately event.
{13903}{13931}Confirm.

{14144}{14162}Captain!
{14162}{14186}We are right behind you.
{14307}{14337}l got you.
{14381}{14429}-Are you okay?|-Yeah.
{14429}{14468}Alright, everbody. Here they come.
{15374}{15410}Are you okay?
{15531}{15592}Can you give me one good reason why|l shouldn't arrest you?
{15592}{15630}l am Dr. Aki Ross.
{15630}{15665}l have clearance to be here.
{15665}{15717}Not unlimited clearance.|And not without authorization.
{15717}{15747}Captain, l don't have time for this.
{15747}{15823}Do you realize you have just risk|the lifes at my squad and me?
{15823}{15860}Look.|l don't want to talk about it.
{15860}{15930}The fact of the matter is, it|was worth the lifes of you and your men.
{15930}{15964}You and your men?
{15964}{15988}She thinks you are a man.
{15988}{16012}l think she's an idiot.
{16012}{16034}l know you are not a man.
{16034}{16060}l think you're an idiot too.
{16060}{16098}Very funny.
{16098}{16133}But i do want to talk about it.
{16133}{16223}Did it occur to you that maybe we are not|volunteer to risk our lifes?
{16223}{16267}Have we been given a choice?
{16267}{16318}Nobody asked yu to save me.
{16318}{16371}l can't believe this.|You have not changed a bit.
{16418}{16456}Gray?
{16637}{16711}Yeah, nice to see you too.
{18061}{18086}Welcome back, captain.
{18086}{18117}We're cleaned.
{18117}{18149}Let's make sure of this, shall we?
{18149}{18191}l hate getting scanned.
{18191}{18266}Sir, the scan probably worth to us|than the phantoms.
{18266}{18303}l'll probably abort it, captain.
{18303}{18352}This machine are suspected|to causing sterility.
{18352}{18421}And l want to have a little|new junior to call me daddy someday.
{18421}{18458}That's a spooky thought.
{18458}{18503}Why are you always busting my chop?
{18503}{18545}People, let's just do this thing. Alright.
{18545}{18611}-Yes, sir.|-Yes, sir.
{18890}{18937}Okay, next.
{19000}{19038}Looks like you gain some weight.
{19038}{19096}lt's called body strength, Neil.|Get a girlfriend.
{19096}{19135}l'm working on it.
{19154}{19216}You know my security rating allows|me to bypass this.
{19216}{19267}Not today, it doesn't.
{19315}{19345}Something's not right.
{19345}{19363}About this mission?
{19363}{19419}-Or that woman?|-Both.
{19419}{19462}Next.
{19466}{19492}Listen, captain. l think...
{19492}{19550}l don't care what you think, doctor.
{19550}{19603}You're getting scanned|just like everbody else.
{19802}{19820}Oh shit!
{19820}{19840}Captain!
{19840}{19860}They got him.
{19860}{19883}There must be a mistake.
{19883}{19939}You came in contact with the phantom, sir.
{19939}{19972}Please remain calm.
{19972}{20013}Administring treatment sheild.
{20026}{20042}What level is he?
{20042}{20056}Blue.
{20056}{20084}He will be coded at 3 1/2 minutes.
{20167}{20189}We have to treat him now.
{20189}{20228}l'm sorry.|That's impossible.
{20228}{20262}We'll transfer him to the treatment centre.
{20262}{20297}There's no time for that.
{20409}{20435}Take him to the table.
{20466}{20499}Hang on, captain.
{20831}{20870}Locating particles.
{21032}{21087}Jesus! Look at that thing.
{21101}{21120}How much more time?
{21120}{21141}Not enough.
{21141}{21161}When he reaches code red,
{21161}{21222}the treatment sheild won't|be able to hold the aliens particles
{21255}{21298}Engaging bio-ethereal laser.
{21753}{21783}-What's going on?|-Where does it go?
{21783}{21805}What the hell is going on?
{21805}{21831}We lost contact.
{21831}{21878}lnfer station is moving deeper.
{21899}{21936}-Dragging.|-There is no time.
{21936}{21995}-Dragging.|-There is no time!
{21995}{22031}You're gonna lose him.
{22110}{22140}Founded.
{23231}{23264}lt's alright.
{23332}{23404}Don't worry. You'll be back to|normal in no time.
{23438}{23508}Doctor, we need to scan you|for in infer station.
{23508}{23565}That won't be necessary.
{23581}{23620}l'll take responsibility.
{23691}{23798}Hei, Doc. Thanks for saving him.
{23865}{23882}Are you alright?
{23882}{23933}Yeah, but the military has|impounded my ship
{23933}{23970}What's with her?
{23970}{24011}And what's with her with the captain?
{24011}{24058}What's with her and the stupid plan?
{24131}{24159}What?
{24209}{24302}Forward me the phantom data and everthing|we got in the file spirits collected so far.
{24302}{24330}Yes, Doctor.
{24335}{24419}Spirits? l thought we are not|suppose to use the S word.
{24434}{24477}Don't get smart with me.
{24504}{24575}Let's see if the plant does the trick.
{24850}{24872}lt's a match.
{24872}{24901}We've found it.
{24901}{24967}Yes, the 6th spirit.
{24967}{25047}A little scene today brought|me every protocol
{25047}{25114}How long do you think this would|have survive outside the barrier?
{25114}{25199}Aki, you know there are elements in|the coucil military just waiting
{25199}{25239}for an excuse to shut us down.
{25239}{25330}Look. 10 years ago, who discovered|the energy and the phantoms?
{25330}{25360}You.
{25360}{25467}And who proved the same energy source|existed in humans and every life form?
{25467}{25502}You.
{25502}{25619}You made the possible to harness that energ|for overpacks, scanners, even the barrier.
{25619}{25663}The council knows that.
{25663}{25745}They trust you, Doctor.|We are so close to proving...
{25745}{25801}We still need this part and this one here.
{25801}{25873}Exactly. Two more pieces|and we solve the puzzle.
{25873}{25929}We need to be free to find these pieces.
{25929}{25982}l want to show you something, Aki.
{26027}{26072}-What is this?|-Read.
{26082}{26167}All life is born of Gaya and each|life has a spirit.
{26167}{26251}Each new spirit is housed in|physical boday. Doctor...
{26251}{26299}Go on.
{26299}{26375}Through their experinces on Earth,|the spirits mature and grows.
{26375}{26423}When the physical body dies,
{26423}{26588}the mature spirit enrich by|it's life on Earth returns to Gaya.
{26588}{26716}Bring in with it the experiences,|enabling Gaya to live and grow.
{26720}{26743}To my old diary.
{26743}{26856}l wrote that 43 years ago when l|was the age you are now.
{26904}{26942}Dr. Sid!
{26942}{27003}l don't know what happen|to Gary Will.
{27003}{27037}They threw him into jail|because he said
{27037}{27086}'the Earth was not|descendant of the universe.'
{27121}{27157}That could happen to us.
{27169}{27233}Our ideas are unpopular, Aki.
{27233}{27275}lf you have any notes or records,
{27275}{27316}it could|be used against you.
{27316}{27396}Destroy them.|Keep them up here.
{27396}{27435}Right.
{27439}{27503}And stay away from your friend,|that captain.
{27503}{27553}He saves your life,|you save his life.
{27553}{27600}That's least to that.
{27606}{27642}l was once young too,|you know.
{27642}{27689}Doctor,|there is a war going on.
{27725}{27770}No one is young anymore.
{29311}{29400}Could you please explain why|Zeus cannon
{29400}{29447}was completed a month ago.
{29447}{29486}lf we attack their media with this,
{29486}{29556}we will eliminate the phantoms|at their source.
{29556}{29585}General Hein,|calm down.
{29585}{29629}At our last meeting,
{29629}{29682}we voted 6 to 2 to|postpone using the Zeus cannon.
{29682}{29726}To attack alienated media.
{29726}{29810}We have reconvince today to vote|on that very issue again.
{29810}{29930}Now l would like to ask the director|of the bio-ethereal centre to speak.
{29930}{29971}Dr Sid, please.
{30012}{30044}As you all know,
{30044}{30150}the phantom nested the alienated|media that landed haere 34 years ago.
{30150}{30194}What you see now,
{30194}{30268}are the records of assault|on the media to date.
{30268}{30378}Physical attacks here had no affect.
{30378}{30470}This seems to place 3 months ago|joining a full scale or art.
{30470}{30584}Please not that the phantom outside|the media are indeed destroyed.
{30584}{30675}However inside, many that come to live.
{30675}{30785}And as you see over all phantom|density remains the same.
{30785}{30863}The newly recent aliens response|to the attack.
{30863}{30935}By burly,|even deeper into the Earth.
{30935}{30992}Now this is very interesting to me,|Dr. Sid.
{30992}{31083}Because we see the|same thing during surgery.
{31083}{31163}When using bio-ethereal laser|on phantom particles.
{31163}{31222}-Do we not?|-Yes, indeed we do.
{31222}{31294}You see the injured escape,
{31294}{31383}burying or digging|themselves deeper into the patient body.
{31383}{31482}When we increase the laser power|to destroy these deep particles.
{31482}{31611}We have had incidents resulting and|further injury to a patient.
{31611}{31681}And in some cases, death.
{31698}{31744}And what exactly does that mean,|Doctor?
{31744}{31806}lt means there is|a very good chance to
{31806}{31889}being from the Zeus cannon|built in the phantoms in a media.
{31889}{31918}Exactly. Thank you.
{31918}{31934}However,
{31934}{32082}it also means that the being energy|maybe too strong injuring the Earth.
{32097}{32272}lnjure the Earth?|You mean the spirit of the Earth?
{32297}{32394}Yes. The spirit of the Earth.
{32420}{32457}l need to saya what l need to say.
{32457}{32522}l know what l'm doing.
{32522}{32567}And whatever you do,|keep you mouth shut.
{32576}{32595}This is ridiculous.
{32595}{32642}Doctor,|with all the respect.
{32644}{32726}You come here just to talk|about some Gaya theory?
{32726}{32796}Tell us the planet is alive?
{32796}{32870}Has a spirit?|That's a fairy tale, Doctor.
{32870}{32915}Sorry, but we don't have time for that.
{32915}{32973}lt's not a fairy tale, it's true.
{32973}{33110}So if l point a gun to the Earth and fire,
{33110}{33208}l'm not just making a hole on|the ground, l am killing the planet.
{33208}{33263}Dr. Sid, the Gaya theory has|not been proven.
{33263}{33304}Even the Gaya does exist.
{33304}{33369}We still have to remove the phantoms.
{33369}{33438}l think if there is any chance of success.
{33438}{33465}We should take it?
{33465}{33520}-Don't you agree?|-Of course l do.
{33520}{33588}But there is an alternative to this|space cannon
{33588}{33612}Another method?
{33612}{33676}Yes, l mean of disabling the phantoms.
{33676}{33710}Please.
{33739}{33817}we know that the aliens display|distinct energy pattern
{33841}{33966}Now it is a fact that two bio-ethereal|waves places one over the other
{33966}{34006}will cancel each other out.
{34006}{34080}lt's the erectile possible|to construct the wave pattern
{34080}{34141}direct opposition to the phantom energy.
{34141}{34178}We are currently esembling...
{34225}{34257}-Dr. Sid....|-such a wave in new completion...
{34257}{34328}Members of the council,|gathering plants and animals
{34328}{34430}from around the world to fight|the phantoms is other nonsense.
{34430}{34530}The Zeus cannon is a|proven effective weapon.
{34530}{34602}lt will kill phantoms.
{34610}{34682}Can we afford to wait for some|crazy inventions
{34682}{34782}Some army of touchy feeling|plants and animals
{34782}{34866}An invention with no solid evidence|that will destroy the aliens.
{34866}{34901}There is evidence.
{34901}{34959}Our partially completed energy wave has
{34959}{35011}a terminally successfully|stopped phantom particles
{35011}{35075}from spreading through a|terminally infected patient.
{35075}{35165}Doctor, do you claim to have evidence|that terminally patient has been cured.
{35165}{35248}Not cured. The wave is not completed.
{35248}{35363}But we have succeeded in containing|the particles safely inside the patient.
{35363}{35438}Where is the proof?
{35438}{35483}Here.
{35813}{35854}You may have bothered sometime, Aki.
{35854}{35895}But l wonder what caused?
{35901}{35986}Doctor, l can't keep hiding|in the background while you protect me.
{35986}{36044}l want what life l have left|to mean something.
{36044}{36147}You listen to me.|When we find the 7th and 8th spirits......
{36147}{36224}lf we find them, what we need|now is some luck.
{36224}{36286}Luck has nothing to do with it.
{36286}{36353}Fate and hardwork, girl.
{36353}{36433}Cause l'll be damn if you die before me.
{37119}{37184}The council decided to postpone|firing the Zeus cannon.
{37200}{37247}l guess l put on a good show.
{37255}{37290}Mind if l take a look?
{37290}{37325}You'll probably get bored.
{37649}{37696}So what are you doing?
{37762}{37792}Oh, l see.
{37792}{37829}Giving me the silent treatment.
{37835}{37913}l am scanning the city for the 7th spirit.
{38221}{38242}Hurry up, Neil.
{38242}{38276}l almost got it.
{38276}{38305}What do you think you are doing?
{38305}{38348}We just gonna streghthen them for a while.
{38348}{38421}Hey, don't look at me. lt was his idea.
{38421}{38456}lt's your idea?
{38456}{38506}We just help the captain up a little.
{38506}{38557}Come on, Jane.|Where's your sense of romance ?
{38571}{38614}You see how the captain looks at her.
{38723}{38760}lt's a more, baby.
{38810}{38832}What's going on?
{38832}{38879}Probably just a glitch.
{38891}{38984}-Listen, Aki...|-l'm still mad at you.
{38984}{39012}You are mad at me?
{39012}{39072}Leaving your helmet on and not|telling me who you were?
{39072}{39122}That doesn't seem a little childish.
{39122}{39231}l was just a little upset when you dispack an|leave the Zeus station without saying a word
{39231}{39283}Now you know what's going on, alright?
{39283}{39307}Now l know.
{39307}{39371}My operation had to be done|in zero graph,okay?
{39371}{39401}Fine!
{39408}{39455}how about the fact that|l was sent there on the job
{39455}{39480}And you won't even see me?
{39480}{39544}l was probably helping|Dr. Sid collected the spirit wave.
{39544}{39565}Now l know.
{39565}{39588}So l'm sorry.
{39588}{39629}Well, me too. So we are both sorry.
{39801}{39838}So would you tell me about them?
{39838}{39893}About what?
{39900}{39947}About the spirits you collected.
{39956}{40054}l was infected by the|phantom during an experiment.
{40068}{40109}Normally no one could had survived.
{40117}{40141}How could you?
{40149}{40215}Dr. Sid created a memory|around the infection
{40215}{40252}Keeping me alive.
{40252}{40311}So the first spirit wave was me.
{40319}{40355}The second was a fish.
{40355}{40380}A fish?
{40380}{40480}The third was a deer l found in|a wildlife-preserved outside Moscow.
{40480}{40539}The fourth was a bird.
{40550}{40611}Ever try to track a sparrow out of space?
{40620}{40646}lt's no fun.
{40650}{40692}What am l saying?|You probably would love that.
{40692}{40722}You are right. l probably would.
{40722}{40799}And then there was that plant|l collected from Time Square.
{40799}{40833}l thought that was number 6.
{40833}{40872}-What?|-You skipped one.
{40956}{41065}The fifth was a little girl dying in|a hospital emergency room.
{41087}{41165}l retrieved the disabling time, but she...
{41215}{41264}l told her everything has a spirit.
{41264}{41364}Dogs, cats, trees, little girls,|even the earth.
{41389}{41483}l told her that she wasn't dying, just|returning to the Earth spirit.
{41491}{41524}The Gaya.
{41549}{41685}She... told me that she|was ready to die.
{41766}{41877}She said l didn't have to make up|stories to make her feel better.
{41959}{42026}Only 7 years old and ready to die.
{42033}{42059}l'm sorry.
{42089}{42194}l have work to do. l have to find|the 7th and the 8th spirits.
{42202}{42268}Don't... please....
{42278}{42333}You don't believe any|of this,do you?
{42350}{42428}l just... don't know, Aki.
{42526}{42579}ls this why you shut me out?
{42583}{42619}You should have told me.
{42646}{42705}l don't know how much time l left.
{42736}{42766}Who does?
{42910}{42948}l better get back to scanning.
{43338}{43476}Captain Edwards, you extracted a Dr. Ross|from old New York several days ago.
{43476}{43499}Did you not?
{43499}{43568}What were you impressions of Dr Ross?
{43576}{43650}She seems very capable and determines.
{43656}{43757}You and the Deep Eyes are being|temporary reassigned.
{43764}{43843}You will guard Dr. Ross when she|re-enters the waste land.
{43843}{43871}Understood, sir.
{43871}{43918}You don't understand yet, Captain.
{43918}{44042}Report any ebullent behaviour in Dr Ross|to the Major immediately.
{44042}{44080}Ebullient behaviour, sir?
{44080}{44145}The woman carrys an alien|infer station, captain.
{44145}{44211}We don't know what it maybe doing to her.
{44211}{44270}The aliens presence could be|effecting her judgement.
{44270}{44342}And maybe manipulate the Doctor|for their very own purposes
{44342}{44434}ls the General suggesting that|Dr Ross is a spy ?
{44454}{44556}The General is wondering why he|explains himself to a captain.
{44568}{44629}She seperated long exposure|to phantom tissue
{44636}{44694}lf this begins to manifest itself in anyway,
{44694}{44749}Dr Ross is to be placed under arrest.
{44749}{44813}And transport here for observation.
{44857}{44936}lt is in fact for her own good, captain.
{44936}{44970}Of course, sir.
{45151}{45252}Major, send some of our man|to keep an eye on our good captain.
{47537}{47619}l'm convinced these dreams are|some form of communication.
{47625}{47676}The message still elude to me.
{47683}{47716}But they are coming faster now.
{47716}{47765}And that can only mean one thing.
{47808}{47880}The phantoms inside me are|beginning to win
{47885}{47955}Our target is to discrete at two sign.
{47955}{47973}Roger.
{47973}{48017}Phantom concentration.|Not good.
{48017}{48060}We got big minutes everywhere.
{48060}{48101}So it's gonna be a real picnic.
{48101}{48171}Stick close to me. No heroin today, okay?
{48171}{48203}Everything by the book.
{48203}{48252}By the book, alright.
{48409}{48482}lf we drop energy here, here and here.
{48482}{48539}We should be able quiet at the target
{48539}{48594}and get out even before the|phantoms know we were there.
{48594}{48638}And that would attract the phatoms.
{48638}{48695}For a while.
{48931}{48966}So you are from the 307s, right?
{48966}{49056}Under General Hein? Have you done|any wasteland recon before?
{49056}{49105}And get pretty ugly.
{49736}{49864}Captain, rendezvous at sector 6 coded 279.
{49864}{49936}Roger that. Stellar for hard files.
{50387}{50425}Looks like they are taking a bath.
{50811}{50879}The 7th spirit should be just|beyond the line.
{50890}{50964}l don't see how any living thing|could survive out here.
{50969}{50989}You'll find out soon enough.
{51062}{51129}This was the phantom cleansing mission.
{51129}{51186}lt was supposed the end of war.
{51250}{51305}My father is in here somewhere.
{51383}{51463}Alright. Let's move out, people.
{51858}{51893}l'll be damn.
{51896}{51932}A survivor.
{51948}{51991}What is it doing out here?
{51991}{52048}Hoping for life to return.
{52075}{52178}-ls that our spirit, Doc?|-No.
{52524}{52556}We've closing in on a life form.
{52557}{52577}Distance?
{52578}{52605}Hard to say.
{52605}{52677}We are very close.
{52682}{52706}l don't see anything.
{52849}{52898}You're not gonna tell me it's him.
{52904}{52934}That's impossible
{53141}{53189}lt's not the soldier. lt's his overpack.
{53189}{53214}How do you explain that?
{53214}{53271}Packs? Power or weapon?|The barrier cities?
{53271}{53335}l mean it's just by with theory energy.
{53335}{53387}And to create that energy,|we use living tissue.
{53387}{53419}Single cell organism.
{53419}{53471}You're telling me his|backpack is the 7th spirit.
{53471}{53504}Yes.
{53504}{53540}Captain, do you read me?
{53540}{53587}Once again.
{53587}{53624}Captain, we have incoming.
{53624}{53679}Ryan, get the soldier's pack.
{54094}{54141}l need a hand, sergeant.
{54232}{54261}-Those boys.|-Yeah.
{54261}{54281}Then l'll working.
{54281}{54307}Thank you.
{54382}{54399}Are you alright?
{54399}{54430}Of course l am.
{54430}{54483}Let's get the hell out of here.
{54587}{54632}Something is not right.|lt should be happening.
{54632}{54665}Something are tracking them.
{54665}{54736}Aki...
{54850}{54897}There are right on us, sir.|Closing fast.
{54897}{54935}Jane, take the lead.
{55302}{55330}Fire the hole!
{55634}{55663}Get us out of here, Neil.
{55663}{55719}Sir, l would love to.
{55719}{55764}-But...|-Just do it!
{56346}{56395}-Sir?|-Locate that seat.
{56437}{56481}That doesn't look good, captain.
{56481}{56526}We have to get her to a hospital.
{56534}{56581}You have your order, sir.
{56584}{56629}What the hell is happening here?
{56629}{56696}Dr Ross is to be taken|into the custody now.
{56817}{56860}Lower your weapon.|That's an order.
{56860}{56925}We have no choice but to relief|you and your command.
{56925}{56959}l won't let you do this, soldier.
{56959}{56986}You'll gonna have to shoot me.
{56986}{57029}Bend down, captain!
{58471}{58499}Aki!
{59040}{59062}Hang on, everyone!
{59210}{59236}That's enough!
{59236}{59285}Everyone down.
{59875}{59911}Neil, get us back to New York.
{59911}{59937}Fast.
{60188}{60238}The device are returned|from the wasteland, sir.
{60238}{60280}Apparently there was an incident.
{60280}{60376}lt would seem the phantoms|were attracted to Dr Ross.
{60376}{60423}The crew barely escaped|with their lifes.
{60426}{60504}And sir... Captain Edward|is still in command.
{60524}{60561}lssue an order.
{60568}{60641}l want Edward and|Dr Ross to be place under arrest.
{60641}{60718}All research materials pretending|to Dr Sid wave theory
{60718}{60776}are to be confiscated immediately.
{60776}{60828}That might not go over too well|with the council, sir.
{60828}{60883}What a tragedy that would be.
{60883}{60952}This is perfect, Major.
{60957}{61010}lt's too good the captain|has opened the door for us.
{61029}{61088}By tomorrow morning,|the council would bear our feet.
{61094}{61168}Thanking us for exposing|the traitors and imploring us.
{61175}{61226}To save them from the phantoms.
{61345}{61379}How is she, Doctor?
{61403}{61436}She is dying.
{61436}{61485}There must be something you can do.
{61491}{61549}Aki is fighting with only|the 6th and 8th spirits.
{61549}{61619}We have to implant the 7th|directly into her chest plate.
{61627}{61653}lt took a bullet.
{61653}{61696}l think it might be damage.
{61707}{61752}We have to apppear this panel quickly.
{61771}{61814}Her vital signs are dropping.
{61825}{61874}Aki is slipping away from us.
{61905}{62005}She needs a sympathetic spirit|to help her held hold in this world.
{62016}{62093}And l can think of no spirit but|to suit for that task but yours,
{62093}{62113}captain.
{62119}{62164}l don't understand.
{62164}{62200}You don't have to understand.
{62215}{62266}You just be with her now.
{62307}{62348}You'll keep her here with us.
{63606}{63663}Aki, where are we?
{63663}{63698}On an alien planet.
{63698}{63737}How is that possible?
{63770}{63839}l'm not entirely sure.
{63839}{63880}You seem pretty calm.
{63892}{63969}l have been having this dream|every night for months.
{63969}{63995}Dream?
{64012}{64059}Well, whatever it is.
{64075}{64157}You're really here, aren't you?
{64193}{64246}What's happening to me?
{64250}{64344}Dr Sid is implanting the 7th spirit|directly into your body.
{64371}{64430}Then you are my spiritual support.
{64442}{64518}Gray, how sweet of you.
{64523}{64607}l don't think you realize how|serious this situation is.
{64695}{64744}Something you should see here, sir.
{64936}{65000}And l am watching... what, major?
{65000}{65092}lt seems Dr Ross has been|recording her dreams.
{65110}{65213}And why would i be interested in it...|her dreams?
{65221}{65276}This is it.|This is our evidence.
{65276}{65335}She's under influence|of the phantoms.
{65459}{65485}Dr Ross's dreams should be
{65485}{65565}all the council needs authorize|the firing of the Zues cannon.
{65565}{65656}The council is contempt to|hide powering inside this barrier
{65656}{65705}while the world dies a little more everyday.
{65705}{65785}l believe they need a push in|the right direction, major.
{65785}{65836}Get another a group|of your most trusted men.
{67102}{67127}What are they doing?
{67127}{67154}Why are they staring at us?
{67154}{67201}Not at us.
{68402}{68438}Welcome back, captain.
{68510}{68540}ls it over?
{68565}{68596}How is she, Doctor?
{68596}{68629}She is going to be fine.
{68629}{68664}But this is only temporary.
{68664}{68736}We need to find the 8th and|final spirit to cure her.
{68824}{68889}Aki, can you hear me?
{68944}{68985}l'd finished it.
{68989}{69102}l know what the phantoms really are.
{69119}{69157}Nobody move!
{69176}{69223}You are all under arrest!
{69473}{69506}We have them, sir.
{69535}{69569}Sir?
{69578}{69629}My wife and daughter.
{69678}{69783}Were killed by phantoms in San Francisco|when the city was attacked.
{69796}{69847}Did l ever tell you that?
{69897}{69950}l try to imagine what...
{69967}{70029}How is that like seeing everyone|around you,
{70029}{70088}fall over dead with|no apparent reason.
{70133}{70161}And then at the end,
{70161}{70220}you're feeling something next to you.
{70235}{70319}lnvisible... touching you.
{70346}{70397}Reaching inside your body.
{70441}{70507}You've lost family, haven't you?
{70507}{70559}Yes, sir.
{70559}{70627}That's why l trust you.
{70636}{70669}All for you.
{70678}{70739}You know what must be done.
{71094}{71127}Major, arrest these man.
{71361}{71400}Reduce power to sector 31.
{71407}{71469}Sir, you do realize thats the phantoms...
{71469}{71486}What l realise,
{71486}{71585}major is that we must force the council|to take action against the enemy.
{71753}{71792}25%.. of energy redirect.
{71851}{71914}Overring power put to sector 31.
{71946}{72005}Bury the bridge in sector 31, General.
{72005}{72025}They're coming through now.
{72025}{72109}l think we can easily handle a few|phantoms in a contain space.
{72127}{72155}Relax, major.
{72159}{72237}When this night is over,|you are going to be a hero.
{72303}{72325}Aki, l don't think...
{72325}{72348}You were in my dream, Gray.
{72348}{72366}You saw it.
{72366}{72389}That's just it.
{72389}{72418}l'm not sure what l saw.
{72418}{72436}How can you be?
{72436}{72462}Captain, please.
{72462}{72488}Let her continue.
{72488}{72549}Why do you think,
{72549}{72608}we've never been able|to determine a relationship
{72608}{72641}between the human size phantoms.
{72641}{72699}And the giant one's roaming|away slants.
{72699}{72726}Excuse me, Doc.
{72726}{72784}But frequent relationship.
{72784}{72906}l mean you got your human size phantoms|and your creepy caterpillary phantoms.
{72906}{72931}And your flying phantoms.
{72931}{72976}And less not forget|my personal favourite.
{72976}{73016}The big fat giant phantoms...
{73016}{73060}-Down, boy.|-He's right.
{73060}{73111}lf you spend as much time in|this field as we have.
{73111}{73170}You know there is no relationship.
{73170}{73210}ls like a zoo out there.
{73210}{73360}Precisely, l think the giant ones|are like our whales along for the ride?
{73360}{73469}lt must be the ship of some kind|crazy known as ark.
{73495}{73617}We always assume that the media|was intended as a form of transportion.
{73617}{73640}Perhaps it wasn't.
{73640}{73684}The media is a chunk of their planet.
{73684}{73746}They got thrown into space|when they destroyed their world.
{73746}{73861}But how could they survive the trip|across outer space on a hunk of rock?
{73867}{73895}They didn't.
{73972}{74048}This is all beginning to make|a creepy kind of sense.
{74057}{74098}What do you think about all this, captain?
{74098}{74192}l think that explains why we|never had a chance.
{74204}{74271}All our strategies are based|on one assumption.
{74282}{74364}That me are fighting alien invaders.
{74370}{74412}Think of the dream, Gray.
{74412}{74443}How they die?
{74443}{74501}Since then,|all they know is suffering.
{74501}{74563}They are not an invading army.
{74563}{74589}They are ghosts.
{74655}{74682}How many phantoms?
{74682}{74735}More than enough to|convince the council, sir.
{74735}{74819}Excellent.|Send the squad out to eliminate them.
{74819}{74847}Yes, sir.
{74913}{74953}Sir,|l have numerous phantoms contacts.
{74953}{74986}Well, of course you do.
{74986}{75030}Outside sector 31, sir.
{75030}{75073}And moving in incredible speed.
{75073}{75120}Major,|what the hell is going on here?
{75120}{75142}They are in the pipes.
{75216}{75239}That's impossible.
{75239}{75312}No living thing could survive|in those pipes.
{75312}{75386}Well,|we got a big one heading this way.
{75606}{75639}Oh my god...
{75654}{75689}Hold your fire!
{76809}{76844}What have l done?
{77347}{77367}Come on, Neil.
{77367}{77399}We need to find a way out.
{77414}{77451}Now think.
{77455}{77501}Captain, these wall titanium alloy.
{77501}{77548}And the bars are all pole|sonic lasers.
{77548}{77620}l mean is not like l can just wave|a magic wont and...
{77647}{77741}Neil, l'm impressed.
{77745}{77773}That makes two of us.
{77773}{77838}Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
{77920}{77985}l think we should proceed to|the nearest evacuation facility.
{78023}{78097}Proceed|to the nearest evacuation facility.
{78615}{78631}Here they come.
{78631}{78674}But the others... Dr. Sid!
{78681}{78724}Deep Eyes will take care of him. Come on!
{78918}{78944}What's happening?
{78944}{78967}Why can we see them now?
{78967}{79031}lt must be carry resistable charge|passing through the barrier.
{79161}{79181}Behind you!
{80683}{80713}On the board,captain.
{82341}{82374}We must find my ship.
{82374}{82436}lf it was towed inside the city,|it could be in the military hangar.
{82436}{82466}That's a big 'lf'.
{82698}{82724}Look out!
{82915}{82948}-Get us out of the platform.|-You got it.
{83399}{83440}Okay, now what?
{83446}{83493}-We're going through the station.|-What?
{83493}{83559}-Captain, with all respect...|-Excuse me, captain...
{83559}{83618}We're going through it.
{83618}{83674}lt's the only way.
{83674}{83761}Should l gather all this will|be somehow a rough ride.
{83761}{83816}Doc, you got a talent for understatement.
{83816}{83896}Hang on, everbody.
{84463}{84496}Doc?
{84594}{84620}lnteresting.
{84634}{84660}Anybody hurt?
{84666}{84692}Captain!
{84795}{84844}Oh God! Talk to me, sergeant.
{84868}{84944}-Give me a hand, Jane.|-No, wait!
{84956}{84982}We're risking for the injury.
{84989}{85030}We need the proper tools to cut him out.
{85037}{85059}They are in my ship.
{85097}{85131}No! No, Doc.
{85134}{85158}No drugs.
{85161}{85206}-Captain...|-You heard the man.
{85206}{85272}We'll find the ship and|we'll be back for you.
{85281}{85317}-l'll stay with him.|-Me too.
{85323}{85356}Nobody's staying.
{85390}{85420}Just give me a gun.
{85420}{85464}You got it.|Give him a weapon.
{85464}{85499}Do it!
{85569}{85606}We'll be back for you, sergeant.
{85616}{85638}You hear me?
{85656}{85730}l hear you,captain.|Now get out of here.
{85734}{85760}Let's move out.
{86996}{87031}Aqua isolated T.V.
{87033}{87056}This is good.
{87056}{87131}lt can be used to retrieve Ryan and|transport him safely here.
{87131}{87217}How ever we need to replace|this plane's fuel
{87238}{87300}There could be some lifes|overpack in the hangar.
{87300}{87337}Alright, Jane.|Check the hangar.
{87342}{87381}Neil, get us ready for take off.
{87381}{87431}Aki and Dr. Sid prep the quad troll.
{87431}{87484}l'll go to the tower and rotate the air track.
{87491}{87557}The city maybe lose. But we are not.
{87557}{87608}Let's do this thing and get|the hell out of here.
{87859}{87881}Gray...
{87889}{87914}Be careful.
{87914}{87938}You too.
{88963}{88991}Oh yeah.
{89373}{89397}Neil, do you read me?
{89406}{89435}Loud and clear, captain.
{89435}{89482}This baby would fly itself.
{89675}{89705}Flight plane is set.
{89707}{89733}Beginning routation.
{89836}{89881}This is not the air track.|We have a problem.
{89881}{89947}l'm reading an impound|tracks detach to the ship.
{89947}{89991}Can you disengage it from the cockpit?
{89991}{90064}No, sir. Permission to go outside|and detach the cockpit.
{90064}{90113}Do it!
{90406}{90432}There is the problem.
{90657}{90698}The controls are locked naturally.
{90781}{90812}Jane, let me ask you something.
{90812}{90858}You think we're going to get out here alive?
{90858}{90915}l mean l'm wondering if anybody is getting out
{90915}{90963}You think anyone had made it this far?
{90963}{91056}You think this 8th spirit stuff is going|to work and chase out all the phantoms?
{91056}{91109}l mean what if it is all a|bunch of mambo jumbo?
{91137}{91212}Jane, do you mind if we stop talking?
{91212}{91255}l gotta concentrate here.
{91568}{91606}What's happening down there.
{91615}{91643}Nothing we can't handle.
{91965}{92014}-What's your status?|-Almost there.
{92070}{92096}We're fine, sir.
{92099}{92156}Jane is negotiating with|the extreme residents.
{92173}{92191}Talk to me, Jane.
{92242}{92287}No problem here, Captain.
{92419}{92480}Yes! Captain, we are good to go.
{93022}{93063}No!
{93446}{93540}Jane, get out of there.|Get out now! Go!
{93549}{93606}Get the hell out of there!
{93631}{93664}Jane!
{94281}{94324}Unseal the power and ready.
{94345}{94361}Where are you going?
{94361}{94375}To the cockpit.
{94375}{94413}The ship is set on autopilot
{94413}{94462}We are in countdown to leave off.
{94462}{94481}Wait.
{94481}{94507}lt's too dangerous.
{94507}{94540}Aki!
{95116}{95159}Over here. You son of the bitch.
{96906}{96955}Ryan!
{97236}{97306}Gray, do you read me?|What's happening?
{97306}{97365}You and Sid are getting out of here now.
{97365}{97408}No! We can't just leave everyone.
{97408}{97449}Everyone's dead.
{97449}{97543}l'm sorry. But you don't have a choice.
{97584}{97614}Goodbye, Aki.
{101573}{101717}l just... l wish l could believe|they are in a better place.
{104832}{104900}l enlarge the scanning parameter|to include an area.
{104900}{104998}The impact crater.
{105025}{105068}That's the strange place|to find the ex-spirit.
{105075}{105106}Yes, really.
{105106}{105167}But nothing can survive there|except phantoms.
{105167}{105208}Precisely.
{105208}{105284}We suggest that the 8th|spirit is a phatom spirit.
{105289}{105331}l can't explain it until that moment.
{105331}{105390}-But once we get down there...|-Wait!
{105390}{105417}-You'll understand...|-Wait.
{105417}{105456}That's the one way trip.
{105456}{105533}Yes. Yes, l expected that's how|you'll valuate our chance.
{105533}{105595}What am l wrong?|No, l agree.
{105595}{105640}We'll probably won't live long enough
{105640}{105694}To extract the 8th spirit|from the crater...
{105694}{105731}Then why should we try it?
{105731}{105788}Because we don't need to|extract the 8th spirit.
{105788}{105834}We can bring the final spirit here.
{105834}{105906}We can go there and complete|the wave inside the crater.
{105906}{105938}Yes. Exactly.
{105938}{105992}And how do we do that... exactly?
{105992}{106031}l can construct the device.
{106031}{106135}That would attach to Aki's chest plate|together the eight spirits and then...
{106135}{106206}And then what?
{106219}{106256}And then we wait.
{106260}{106294}And see what happens.
{106306}{106332}That's it?
{106356}{106396}That's your plan?|We wait and see what happens?
{106396}{106422}Yes.
{106461}{106495}Oh good.
{106500}{106536}But l got my own plan.
{106536}{106581}We keep scanning the surface of orbit.
{106581}{106634}Maybe we'll find the compatible|spirit somewhere else.
{106646}{106694}Aki?
{106694}{106735}l say we go in.
{106840}{106930}General Hein, you're clear to|go in to the zero one alpha.
{107450}{107496}What caused the battle failed,|General Hein?
{107496}{107588}l'm afraid it's only the matter of time
{107588}{107659}before the phantoms develop|into immunity to our barriers.
{107659}{107742}But l'm ready to see you|and the rest of the council
{107742}{107830}to evacuate to Houston|without incident.
{107838}{107891}lt was a terrible suffer this evening.
{107908}{107980}The council had reconsidered your|proposal fire the Zeus cannon.
{107984}{108013}l see.
{108013}{108072}We are transmitting the|access code to you now.
{108124}{108231}And General,|best of luck to us all.
{108314}{108341}Prepare to fire the cannon.
{108341}{108380}Target, sir?
{108392}{108456}The phantom crater.
{109120}{109196}Prepare to drop in three, two, one.
{109331}{109361}Powering the sheild.
{109442}{109485}Okay,|we are over the mini one.
{109489}{109522}Do you have it inside,|Doctor.
{109522}{109593}There are so many of them?
{109659}{109706}Wait. Yes.
{109706}{109782}l'm tracking the 8th spirit|moving along the crater surface.
{109798}{109855}Alright.|Now let's take a closer look.
{110831}{110869}Ready to fire in 3 minutes.
{110869}{110910}Overpack set maximum.
{110910}{110981}Transfering class to other.
{110981}{111018}Counter thrusters are engaged.
{111018}{111061}Locks flow the couple.
{111061}{111106}Status is green.
{111109}{111164}We have something in the radar|over the impact side, sir.
{111247}{111269}lt's her.
{111269}{111306}Sir.
{111306}{111375}Just a traitor on the influence|of the enemy.
{111388}{111418}Continue the countdown.
{111432}{111493}We'll take them all out at the|same time.
{111588}{111618}We're closing on the phantom.
{111623}{111660}Contact in 30 seconds.
{111706}{111730}Target locked.
{111756}{111795}Ready to fire on your command.
{111912}{111961}lt's a match.|lt's a perfect match.
{111973}{112006}Target's cannon is ready,sir.
{112006}{112030}Fire!
{112867}{112893}What was that?
{112893}{112950}lt's the Zeus.|They're firing on the crater.
{112950}{112991}Aki, Gray, are you alright?
{112991}{113022}A little shaking.
{113022}{113046}Stand by.
{113046}{113106}Sid,|the 8th spirit is not on our scanner.
{113106}{113131}Do you have it?
{113131}{113263}The 8th has been destroyed.
{113269}{113306}What are we going to do now?
{113306}{113372}Nothing. This mission is over.
{113381}{113406}We have to get out of here.
{113406}{113424}lncoming!
{114187}{114220}What is that?
{114231}{114282}lf you gonna get us out of here,|you better do it now.
{114597}{114623}Hold on!
{114844}{114874}l can't hold on to you.
{115006}{115045}l'm not able to maintain.
{115246}{115281}Emergency landing procedures.
{115861}{115920}Come in, come in, please
{115931}{115986}Aki, Gray, can you hear me?
{115995}{116046}Sid, l need to talk to the station.
{116050}{116083}Can you pass us through?
{116156}{116173}What is that thing?
{116173}{116211}l don't know, sir.
{116211}{116248}lncoming message, sir.
{116248}{116346}General Hein,|you must cease fire immediately.
{116346}{116365}What are you looking at,
{116365}{116448}in the crater is the living spirit|of an alien's home world.
{116448}{116519}The planet was destroyed and|part of the it landed here.
{116519}{116560}This is not an invasion.
{116567}{116600}lt never was.
{116600}{116617}Oh, l see.
{116617}{116675}And what we have been|fighting all this time, Doctor?
{116675}{116706}Ghosts?
{116706}{116806}Yes, spirits that are confused,|lost and angry.
{116806}{116823}Oh right?
{116823}{116881}And these spirits|are coming out of the Gaya,
{116881}{116974}Earth Gaya.
{116974}{117022}Doctor,|even if l believe in such nonsense.
{117022}{117081}The fact remains the Earth is|under attack
{117081}{117146}from aggressor who must|be destroyed at all cost.
{117146}{117215}The cost maybe the entire planet,|sir.
{117215}{117297}Fire on the alien Gaya|would only make it stronger.
{117297}{117348}Since that you under the|alien influence, Doctor.
{117348}{117384}l will take your protest to mean,
{117384}{117444}we are in fact persuading|the correct course of action.
{117444}{117567}l suggest you take your last few|months and prepare to meet your Gaya.
{117575}{117630}Continue to fire until the invaders|have been destroyed.
{118520}{118581}General, this is the misoverhitting.
{118581}{118624}We are going to hit again and again.
{118624}{118672}And keep on hitting it,|until it's dead.
{118672}{118741}But sir, we not even sure if it has|any affect on the other creature.
{118741}{118767}No affect.
{118767}{118818}We got them in the run,|soldier.
{118818}{118882}This is the moment of our victory.
{118882}{118921}order you to fire.
{118931}{118981}This won't allow us to fire again.
{118981}{119016}We'll see about that.
{119059}{119113}Now sheild is out,|we're seeking Doc in here.
{119113}{119160}Come on.
{119668}{119707}This is not a good place to be.
{119920}{119962}What the hell is that?
{119962}{120031}-That's something l'm thinking, is it?|-Yes! lt's Gaya.
{120031}{120065}Definitely not a good place to be.
{120131}{120171}Are you alright?
{120171}{120255}l'm fine.|l have to talk to Dr. Sid.
{121197}{121261}Sid, do you read me?
{121275}{121316}Go ahead. l'm still here.
{121316}{121431}We are looking at Gaya.|You hear me, sir? Gaya!
{121444}{121549}l think this explains|why the ex-spirits appeared here.
{121568}{121642}Yes. Yes, that's it.
{121650}{121714}A phantom must have changed|into the 8th spirit
{121714}{121788}when it starts a new life born|on our own Gaya.
{121793}{121872}lf so, it would have been|given a different energy signature
{121872}{121934}that setted apart from the other phantoms.
{121934}{121997}You two could not have hope
{122011}{122085}for better location to find|a new compatible spirit.
{122099}{122144}Whatever you do,|don't move.
{122156}{122189}Stay right where you are.
{122231}{122305}Staying right where we are may|not be as easy as it sound.
{122325}{122448}Don't shoot any of them.|You could destroy our last hope.
{122456}{122500}And what do you suggest l do, Doctor?
{122500}{122531}Ask them to play nice?
{122531}{122631}Combat strategy is your area of experties,|not mine.
{122657}{122697}l have a reading here in official.
{122697}{122731}Do you see it?
{122731}{122794}Yes, a compatible spirit.
{122794}{122845}lt must be very near you.
{122845}{122900}Where? Which on is it?
{122911}{122944}Which one?
{122944}{122981}l'm having difficulty now.
{122981}{123013}Just a moment.
{123081}{123119}Doctor, it's getting crowded in here.
{123119}{123160}We don't have much time.
{123169}{123230}Aki...Aki!
{125368}{125406}With the hope of new life,
{125406}{125480}has Gaya changed|the phantom within?
{125597}{125667}l have it.
{125823}{125868}Gray, get in here. l need you.
{125907}{125936}Do you hear me, Sid?
{125936}{125981}The wave pattern is completed.
{125981}{126041}Yes, l read you.|This is wonderful.
{126041}{126135}l don't see how you could|have found the final spirit.
{126143}{126175}lt found me, Doctor.
{126311}{126391}l see now. l understand.
{126396}{126424}l don't understand.
{126424}{126456}What the hell is going on?
{126456}{126473}Give me your overpack.
{126473}{126513}l need to project|it in the complete way.
{126513}{126545}We'll be defenseless.
{126597}{126638}l hope you know what you are doing,|Aki.
{126638}{126693}We can use the sheild|to project the wave.
{126693}{126787}Dr Sid's theory was right.|l have it, the 8th spirit.
{126793}{126831}l'm cured, Gray.
{126833}{126865}Are you sure you have|the final spirit?
{126865}{126910}Yes, yes. l'm sure.
{126910}{126947}But how?|How can you know that?
{126947}{126991}Don't worry,|the phantom told me.
{126991}{127038}Oh, great.
{127038}{127083}That's it. Sheild on.
{127235}{127257}lt's not working.
{127257}{127306}We have to do something|before it's too late.
{127308}{127367}lf this doesn't work,|then it's already too late.
{127532}{127598}Gray... trust me.
{128433}{128471}No! No!
{128569}{128597}Get down!
{128911}{128958}Warning system overload.
{128958}{128984}l know.
{128984}{129024}Warning system overload.
{129024}{129056}l know!
{129181}{129207}But it must be done.
{130256}{130309}Fire! Fire! Damn it!
{130345}{130371}Fire!
{131617}{131647}Gray?
{131657}{131690}Gray!
{132236}{132281}Don't leave me, Gray.
{132323}{132368}l told you this was an oneway trip.
{132406}{132446}Looks like l was right.
{132446}{132506}No, Gray. Hang on, please.
{132506}{132555}l still have the mave.
{132563}{132596}We can get through this.
{132731}{132761}We are going to make it.
{132761}{132793}We are going to make it.
{132793}{132856}We both know that isn't time.
{133106}{133169}Gray...
{133169}{133212}Help me.
{133417}{133443}Gray...
{133449}{133487}Listen to me.
{133491}{133593}You saved my life once.|Now l want you to save yourself.
{133598}{133642}Gray, no. Please.
{133642}{133716}Let me do this, Aki. Trust me.
{133961}{134006}Don't leave me, Gray.
{134011}{134074}You have been trying to tell me|death isn't the end.
{134074}{134123}Don't back out on me.
{134150}{134205}Now l finally believe.
{134488}{134521}l love you.
{137135}{137231}Oh,it's warm.
