3
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,105
I do not understand.

4
00:02:07,106 --> 00:02:09,313
Krypton's core collapses and fish.

5
00:02:09,314 --> 00:02:11,793
We may have just a few weeks.

6
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:15,044
I warned. A core harvest was suicide.

7
00:02:15,658 --> 00:02:18,031
Accelerate the implosion.

8
00:02:18,032 --> 00:02:21,049
Our energy reserves are exhausted.

9
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,161
- What you wanted to do, he? - Let's look at the stars.

10
00:02:24,162 --> 00:02:27,412
As they did of our ancestors. A world where we can reach habitat.

11
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,953
- We can use outposts. - You can suggest

12
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:33,633
evacuate the entire planet?

13
00:02:33,634 --> 00:02:36,884
No, everyone here is already dead.

14
00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:40,329
Give me control of the codex.

15
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,925
I will ensure the perpetuation of our species.

16
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:46,176
There is still hope. I kept that hope in his hands.

17
00:03:01,694 --> 00:03:04,383
This council was dismissed.

18
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,634
- Under whose authority? - Mine.

19
00:03:11,544 --> 00:03:14,794
The rest of you will be judged and punished accordingly.

20
00:03:17,194 --> 00:03:19,213
How are you, Zod? This is crazy.

21
00:03:19,214 --> 00:03:21,064
What should I do with years ago.

22
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:23,764
Ace're maker of laws, with their endless debates ite

23
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:27,132
led krypton in ruins.

24
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:31,848
And if your forces fail, you will be the leader of anything.

25
00:03:32,074 --> 00:03:35,324
Then join me up. Help me save our race.

26
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,007
We start something new. We interrupt

27
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:41,067
degeneraþilor line that brought us here.

28
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:44,318
And who decides what line survives?

29
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:48,923
You?

30
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:51,479
Do not do this, El. Last thing I want it

31
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,743
is that we should be enemies.

32
00:03:53,744 --> 00:03:56,525
You've abandoned the principles that bind us.

33
00:03:56,526 --> 00:03:59,776
You raised the sword against your men.

34
00:04:00,348 --> 00:04:03,598
I honor the man you once were, Zod,

35
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:07,312
and not the monster you've become.

36
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:12,466
Luaþi-l!

37
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:19,989
- Sir, everything is okay? - Get out of the way.

38
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:24,096
Am Spus ...

39
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:40,367
Lara calls her.

40
00:04:40,368 --> 00:04:43,618
Jor, behind you!

41
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:49,784
Lara prepares you must release. I will join as soon as possible.

42
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:08,382
H'raka!

43
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,200
Home!

44
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,406
- Can you see the codex? - Is as central, sir.

45
00:05:48,446 --> 00:05:51,696
But I must warn you, going into the room genesis is a crime ...

46
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:55,586
Nobody cares, Helix. The world will end and i

47
00:07:00,517 --> 00:07:03,767
Jor-El, by the authority of Daniel-Zon, teaches codex.

48
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:54,767
Ia-o uºor, H'raka.

49
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:18,205
You found a world?

50
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,456
- Yes. - Orbiting the yellow star, like you said.

51
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:27,142
A young star. Cells of them will absorb radiation.

52
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:33,717
It is instead an intelligent populations.

53
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:35,917
It will be an outcast.

54
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:38,313
A weird.

55
00:08:38,314 --> 00:08:41,793
- I will kill you. - No.

56
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:45,044
They will get.

57
00:08:45,412 --> 00:08:48,619
And if the ship does not arrive?

58
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,870
He'll die there alone.

59
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,280
No can do. I think I can, but ...

60
00:08:57,315 --> 00:08:59,280
Lara ...

61
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,821
Krypton e sortitã pieirii.

62
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:05,171
It's our only chance.

63
00:09:05,172 --> 00:09:08,549
It is the only hope of the people.

64
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,800
- Where them killers? - Approaching from the east.

65
00:09:12,062 --> 00:09:14,255
Scans and evaluates defensive fortress.

66
00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:16,061
You enter data.

67
00:09:16,062 --> 00:09:18,239
No, wait.

68
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,490
- Lara ... - Lhasa-mã mã sã doar uit the the.

69
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:29,126
We will not see running.

70
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,950
We will not hear us calling your name.

71
00:09:37,873 --> 00:09:41,123
There, among the stars,

72
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:46,056
and experienced.

73
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:44,081
Farewell, my son.

74
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:46,081
Whether our dreams to travel with you.

75
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:28,081
Concentration fire on the main door.

76
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:47,081
Systems are on.

77
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,257
Continue to start.

78
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:52,508
General, we identified an impending fire in Citadel.

79
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,507
O lansare.

80
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,758
Maintained platform commander.

81
00:12:12,194 --> 00:12:15,444
I know you stole codex, Jor-El.

82
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:18,768
Preda-mi-l º i te voi Lasa sound trãie º ti.

83
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:22,002
This is a second chance for the whole Krypton.

84
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:25,002
not only the lines that you consider worthy.

85
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,190
- What did you do? - We have a baby on board.

86
00:12:30,464 --> 00:12:33,714
A boy. First born vaginally centuries.

87
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,650
And he will be free. And free to shape their destiny.

88
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:44,555
Make him dead!

89
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,806
Destroy the it!

90
00:13:39,326 --> 00:13:42,029
Lara, ascultã-han!

91
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,280
Codex is the future of Krypton.

92
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:49,386
Cancel launch.

93
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:41,018
Fiul Tau, Lara ...

94
00:14:41,668 --> 00:14:44,918
Where did you send?

95
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:50,368
Numele lui este Kal,

96
00:14:51,018 --> 00:14:52,368
son of God.

97
00:14:55,818 --> 00:14:59,068
And it is far from your grasp.

98
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:12,021
Doborâþi the ship.

99
00:15:18,673 --> 00:15:21,923
Target in sight.

100
00:15:31,877 --> 00:15:35,127
Leave down your weapons. Your forces are surrounded.

101
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:49,151
General Zod to accusations of murder, high treason

102
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:53,505
Council condemns you, you and the insurgents Thy

103
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:57,505
300 cycles of somatic recondiþionare.

104
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:02,897
Do you have any last words?

105
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:06,087
Nu vei not Omori. E º these deja mort.

106
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:07,387
Well veþi renunþa the pãlãrii,

107
00:16:08,287 --> 00:16:11,537
but we are forever condemned to a plateau.

108
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,663
Jor-El was right. Are you some fools.

109
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:19,663
To the last.

110
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:22,167
ªi tu...

111
00:16:22,617 --> 00:16:24,167
Do you think your son is safe?

112
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,167
I'll find!

113
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:29,167
Voi revendica

114
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:33,229
what you stole!

115
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:35,717
I'll find him.

116
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:37,717
I will find Lara.

117
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:44,615
I'll find!

118
00:18:25,131 --> 00:18:28,381
Think you Lara, where do you find refuge.

119
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:32,175
There is no refuge.

120
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:36,137
Jor-El was right.

121
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:39,137
This is the end.

122
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:54,137
Make a better world than ours.

123
00:20:26,036 --> 00:20:29,286
Careful, fool. Keep eyes open them!

124
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:35,282
Unde-au gãsit naiba you?

125
00:20:36,482 --> 00:20:39,032
Ensure deck! I received an emergency signal

126
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:41,032
of ...

127
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:44,386
Ensure deck!

128
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,193
Stay away!

129
00:20:50,194 --> 00:20:52,823
- Is about to explode. - Receive.

130
00:20:52,824 --> 00:20:54,777
But the people inside? Done.

131
00:20:54,778 --> 00:20:57,443
Sunt morþi.
Greenhorn!

132
00:20:57,444 --> 00:21:00,569
Adu-mi binoclu.

133
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,820
Greenhorn!

134
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:14,194
We have no oxygen. I do not know how we can resist!

135
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:26,039
This Coast Guard 6510. We'll make a pass

136
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:28,039
And leave.

137
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:33,241
Wait. We helipod people!

138
00:21:53,382 --> 00:21:55,869
We have to go!

139
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,120
Wait! What are you doing?

140
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:06,821
Du-te!

141
00:22:42,684 --> 00:22:45,934
When Kansaul became ...

142
00:22:46,856 --> 00:22:50,106
Clark...

143
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,400
I listen?

144
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,450
Te.am asked who set up Kansaul.

145
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:16,176
Clark, e º ti thousand?

146
00:23:22,013 --> 00:23:24,909
Clark!

147
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:28,160
Clark!

148
00:23:29,644 --> 00:23:32,894
Clark!

149
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,489
Clark, get out of there!

150
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,247
Leave me alone!

151
00:23:38,248 --> 00:23:41,498
Clark, am sunat-o pe mama ta.

152
00:23:45,544 --> 00:23:48,794
- I'm here. - Clark, the mother.

153
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,440
Would you open the door?

154
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:58,648
His parents did not even let him play with other children.

155
00:23:59,632 --> 00:24:02,882
Darling, how can I help if I do not you let go.

156
00:24:03,978 --> 00:24:06,815
The world is too much, Mom.

157
00:24:06,816 --> 00:24:10,066
Then, do it less.

158
00:24:14,358 --> 00:24:17,608
Focus on my voice.

159
00:24:23,674 --> 00:24:26,924
About Poth sciences?

160
00:24:28,674 --> 00:24:31,924
- I see. - Then, go for it.

161
00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:49,576
What's wrong with me, Mom?

162
00:24:50,882 --> 00:24:54,132
Clark...

163
00:26:16,347 --> 00:26:19,597
Carp ... What do you think? Are you in?

164
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:23,332
- Leave him in peace Pete. - What are you? Girlfriend?

165
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,583
I want to hear what he has to say.

166
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:30,391
Heath!

167
00:28:09,842 --> 00:28:12,695
My son was there. It was on the bus.

168
00:28:12,696 --> 00:28:15,207
Clark saw what he did.

169
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:17,859
I'm sure it did.

170
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,110
- I'm sure he thinks he saw. - It was a Divine act, Jonathan.

171
00:28:21,914 --> 00:28:25,164
That was wisdom.

172
00:28:28,546 --> 00:28:31,796
- I'm exaggerating a bit. - No.

173
00:28:32,688 --> 00:28:35,000
ªi Lana a vãzut.

174
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,000
Not the first time that Clark is such a thing.

175
00:28:53,895 --> 00:28:57,145
- I just wanted to help. - I know, but we discussed it.

176
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:02,409
No? We discussed this.

177
00:29:04,095 --> 00:29:07,345
Clark, should you hold this secret part of you.

178
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:11,249
What should I do? Let them die?

179
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:20,009
Maybe ...

180
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:22,009
Clark is more at stake here than the lives recognition.

181
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:24,009
I am and lives of others.

182
00:29:26,941 --> 00:29:30,191
When the world ... When people find out what you can do

183
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:32,191
will change everything.

184
00:29:33,635 --> 00:29:36,085
Beliefs, notions about ...

185
00:29:36,135 --> 00:29:39,085
what it means to be human and all.

186
00:29:39,313 --> 00:29:42,500
You saw how his mother reacted Pete.

187
00:29:42,513 --> 00:29:44,563
He was scared, Clark.

188
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:48,318
- Why? - People are afraid ...

189
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,534
what they do not understand.

190
00:29:51,535 --> 00:29:54,000
Is he right?

191
00:29:54,035 --> 00:29:56,200
God made me this?

192
00:29:57,445 --> 00:29:59,695
Tell me!

193
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,500
I found in it.

194
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,500
I was sure the government will come to our doorstep,

195
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,500
but no one came.

196
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,500
That was in the room with you.

197
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,500
I took her to metals research center in Kansas

198
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,500
And they said they would be made of any metal

199
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,500
do not exist in the periodic table.

200
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,500
Is another way of saying that it is not of this world.

201
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,965
And here's you.

202
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,500
You're the answer, son.

203
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,500
Are you on whether we are alone in the universe.

204
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,500
- I want to be. - I do not blame you, son.

205
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,965
It is a burden to anyone.

206
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,500
But you're not anyone, Clark. You must think you're ...

207
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,500
You're sent here for a reason.

208
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,500
All stages are through now, someday ...

209
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,500
you'll find a blessing and when that day comes,

210
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,965
You have to make a choice.

211
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,500
Choosing to stand proud in front of the race or not.

212
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,500
Still I can not pretend I'm your son?

213
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,500
But you're my son.

214
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,500
But somewhere out there ...

215
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,500
you have another father who gave you another name.

216
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,500
And you were sent here for a reason, Clark.

217
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,500
And even if I'll take the rest of your life,

218
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,500
find out what that reason.

219
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,965
I know, it's crazy, right?

220
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,500
And Americans are there. Many.

221
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,500
We call an object ...

222
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,965
Back, seriously.

223
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,250
- Haide, Gracie ... - ENDS!

224
00:32:44,285 --> 00:32:46,392
- Have a seat. - Let go of me.

225
00:32:46,427 --> 00:32:48,500
Hey, do you want to do this.

226
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,500
Ce e, Durul?

227
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,500
I feel like I'm asking you to leave.

228
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,500
I think I'll leave when I'm ready.

229
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,500
IATA-l!

230
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,500
Nu Merit, Dragan.

231
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,500
Donkey, do not forget your ferry and and the.

232
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,500
Thank you.

233
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:30,965
Good.

234
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,965
Miss Lane, how did it go?

235
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,500
- Okay. - What is your cargo?

236
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,500
How far is the train station?

237
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,965
Will lead you there.

238
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,500
- Great. - Joe can take luggage.

239
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,965
Joe, help!

240
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,500
Be careful with them. Heavy.

241
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,965
I have to confess, Miss Lane,

242
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,500
not a big fan of the Daily Planet.

243
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,500
.

244
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,965
It was very impressive.

245
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,500
What can I say? I bad writing unless I have an armor.

246
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,500
Drã Lane, colonel Hardy, Northcom,

247
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,500
dr Neil Hammilton,

248
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,500
You have arrived earlier, ma'am. Will wait tomorrow.

249
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,500
Why I came today.

250
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,500
But let's get something straight, guys.

251
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,965
The only reason I'm here is

252
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,500
For a Canadian company wants to keep me away.

253
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,500
Dhaka terminat am sane ne mãsurãm sculele,

254
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,500
You can ask people to show me what they got?

255
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,500
NA ª A satellite anomaly caught first.

256
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,250
No looks great thing ecosunete

257
00:35:45,285 --> 00:35:47,500
but surely there is something down there.

258
00:35:47,535 --> 00:35:49,517
It may be a Soviet submarine.

259
00:35:49,552 --> 00:35:50,965
The depth is 300 m

260
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,500
Much bigger than any could have built then.

261
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,250
And that's the weird part.

262
00:35:56,285 --> 00:35:58,500
Ice surrounding the subject

263
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,500
is 20,000 years.

264
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,500
On this night the temperature reaches -40 degrees.

265
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,500
.

266
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,500
We go.

267
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,500
What if I need to relieve?

268
00:36:23,535 --> 00:36:25,500
It's a bucket corner.

269
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,500
Alo!

270
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,250
It's all right.

271
00:40:49,285 --> 00:40:51,500
It's all right.

272
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,965
Ai hemoragie.

273
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,500
If not I'll cauterize bleeding.

274
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,500
- How do you do? - I can do things that other people can not.

275
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,500
Hold my hand. It will hurt.

276
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,500
What Colonel Hardy and his team believed to be a Soviet submarine,

277
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,500
was something much more.

278
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,500
An isotopic analysis of ice surrounding

279
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,250
suggest that stuck in glaciers

280
00:42:32,285 --> 00:42:34,500
was there for over 18,000 years.

281
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,965
As one who saved me ...

282
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,500
object disappeared during departure.

283
00:42:39,535 --> 00:42:40,965
A background check revealed

284
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,500
that both the past and identity were forged.

285
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,500
Question the existence there my savior

286
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,500
are frightening to contemplate. And I also know what I saw.

287
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,500
We concluded that the object and occupant

288
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,500
not originate on Earth.

289
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,500
I can not print it, Lois may have had hallucinations.

290
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,965
What about civilian contractors

291
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,500
- That confirmed the story. - Pentagon denies that it was a ship.

292
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,965
Of course I do.

293
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,500
That should do. It Pentagon.

294
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,965
Harry, talking about me.

295
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,500
I am a prize winning reporter Pultzer.

296
00:43:18,535 --> 00:43:18,965
Then behave as such.

297
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,500
- Public or leave it. - You can not.

298
00:43:21,535 --> 00:43:23,500
Oh contract.

299
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,965
Not publish a story about ...

300
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,500
and aliens who walk among us three.

301
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,500
Not going to happen.

302
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,500
A scotch without ice for the ladies.

303
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,965
I'll send the original article.

304
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,500
My editor will not print, but can occur online.

305
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,965
I got it.

306
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,500
But once you describe the site

307
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,500
full of untruths cancer?

308
00:43:54,535 --> 00:43:55,965
I still maintain the opinion,

309
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,500
- But I want the story there. - Why?

310
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,500
Because I want to know the mystery man that I know the truth.

311
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,500
Diagnoza finished.

312
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,250
Presence guiding login.

313
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:24,500
All systems are operational.

314
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,500
To see you standing there as an adult ...

315
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,500
Only if Lara would have seen this ...

316
00:44:46,535 --> 00:44:47,965
Who are you?

317
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,500
Summary tatal Tau, Kal.

318
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,500
Or at least a shadow.

319
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,500
His conscience.

320
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,500
My name is Jor-El.

321
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,500
.

322
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,500
What is my name?

323
00:45:10,535 --> 00:45:12,500
Kal-El.

324
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,500
I have so many questions.

325
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,500
How come?

326
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,500
Why did you send me here?

327
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,500
You came from the planet Krypton.

328
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,965
A world ...

329
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,500
with a much harsher environment.

330
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,250
A long time ago

331
00:45:39,285 --> 00:45:40,965
in Expansion Era

332
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,500
Our race has spread among the stars.

333
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,500
searching new world where we so ezãm.

334
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,500
This ship was one of the thousands released.

335
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,500
Outposts built on our planet.

336
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,500
Big cars to reshape our environment as needed.

337
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,500
For years 100,000

338
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,500
Our civilization flourished.

339
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,500
He made wonders.

340
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,500
What happened?

341
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,500
Informal control population.

342
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,500
Exploration outposts were abandoned.

343
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,500
We finished our natural resources.

344
00:46:26,535 --> 00:46:28,500
As a result,

345
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,500
core of the planet has become unstable.

346
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,500
Finally, the military leader

347
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,965
Generalul Zod

348
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,500
made an attempt.

349
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,500
But then, it was too late.

350
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,500
Me and your mom have provided calamitatea.00: 46:42:

351
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,500
I made one and to get your ensure survival.

352
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,500
This is your genesis.

353
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,500
Kryptonienii Everyone could see such a chain.

354
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,500
Every child is made to fulfill a role in society.

355
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,500
A warrior, a worker, a leader.

356
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,500
Me and your mother thought that krypton is something precious.

357
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,500
We all had a choice. And chance.

358
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,500
As a child become something that society predestined.

359
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,500
As a child something to aspire to greatness.

360
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,965
You're the result of that belief.

361
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,500
The first natural born on Krypton, after many centuries.

362
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,500
That's why I risked so much to save you.

363
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,500
Why do not you come with me?

364
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,500
I could not leave.

365
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,500
Even if we wanted,

366
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,250
no matter how much I loved you.

Now you're a child of the Earth as long as you're the kryptonite.

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,965
But I think this is a good thing.

376
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,500
There is no need to make the same mistakes as we are.

377
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,500

each person to be a force for good.

384
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,500
That's what you can bring.

385
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,500
There are so diferiþi them.

386
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,500
Sun Earth is younger and brighter.

387
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,500
Our strength comes from solar radiation.

00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,500
but the atmosphere is more nutritious.

You will become more powerful than I imagined.

393
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,965
If you want to know how powerful

394
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,500
is to continue to test the limits.

395
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,965
You bring people on Earth

396
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,500

How do you find someone who has spent a life-and to cover his tracks.

Start with urban legends ...

406

Everyone friends or girlfriends who claim to have seen.

407
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,500
For some, it is a guardian angel.

408
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,500
For others a mystery, a ghost who could not integrate.

409
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,965
How are you and cut your way while

410
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,250

418
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,500

00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,965
Lini º te!

422
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,500
I'm from the Daily Planet and I'd like to talk about your son

423
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,500
I think if you raise enough stones, you have found.

What are you doing here? Let me tell you the story.

426
00:53:44,285 --> 00:53:46,500
What? I do not want my story to be told.

427
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,500
Eventually you come out to light.

428
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,500
Someone taking a picture and realizes its where you live.

429
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,965
And then I disappear again.

430
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,500
The only way to disappear is to never help people

431
00:53:57,535 --> 00:53:59,500
And feel that this is not an option for you.

432
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,965
Dad thought ...

433
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,500
that if the world knew who I really am ...

434
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,250
mã our respinge.

435
00:54:13,285 --> 00:54:15,500
They will fear me.

436
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,500
I'm tired to be sure.

437
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,965
I want to do something useful with my life.

438
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,500
Being a farmer to feed people and not useful?

439
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,965
I never said that.

440
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,500
In my family we were farmers 4 generations.

441
00:54:28,535 --> 00:54:29,965
Families ta, a mea nu.

442
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,500
I do not even know why I listen to you. You're not Dad.

443
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:34,500
You're just a guy who found me in the field.

444
00:54:34,535 --> 00:54:36,500
Clark!

445
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,500
It's all right, Martha.

446
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,500
He's right. He has a point.

447
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,500
We're not your parents.

448
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,250
But I did everything I could

449
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:51,500
And we adapted the way.

450
00:54:51,535 --> 00:54:52,965
So maybe ...

451
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,500
Why can we no longer best.

452
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,965
Look ...

453
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,500

- John! - Mom, stay here.

463
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,500
I let my father die because I trusted him.

464
00:57:21,535 --> 00:57:23,517
Deoarece was convins

465
00:57:23,552 --> 00:57:25,500
that had to wait.

466
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,500
And the world is not ready.

467
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,500
What do you think?

468
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,500
You better watch out, Lois!

Abia te aºteaptã.

00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,500
I told you not to.

473
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,500
So what are you doing? You left the Whitney to fill the internet.

474
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,500
Now the public will know to sue you.

475
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,500

479
00:58:08,535 --> 00:58:09,965
The story was a flash in the pan.

480
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,500
Or had the attraction to that hope.

481
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,500
Salary unpaid two weeks.

482
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,500
This is your punishment. When doing such a thing,

483
00:58:19,535 --> 00:58:21,500
- Was said to you. - Okay.

484

I think you saw something, Lois,

487
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,500

Pista sa rãcit.

489
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,500
So whatever the reasons,

491
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,500
I think you do what is right.

492
00:58:39,535 --> 00:58:41,500
Why?

493
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,500
You imagine how people would react on this planet

494
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,500
If anyone would know it is ...

495
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,500
that person there?

496
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,500
Prive º te-te!

He came here a reporteriþã.

It's a friend. Do not worry.

499
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,500
- Mom ... - What is it?

500
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,500

Now I know where they come from.

504
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,965
How?

505
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,500
It's great.

506
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,500
Good for you, Clark.

507
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,500
- What? - Nothing.

508
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,500
When you were a kid and, I used to sit next to you at night.

509
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,500
Listen to you breathing.

510
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,500
It was hard for you.

511
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,965
Fight.

512
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,965
I always worry about you.

513
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,500
You were afraid that the truth will come out in the open.

514
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,965
No.

515
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,500
The truth about you?

516
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,500
I saw it the moment I laid eyes on you.

517
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,500
I knew that one day the whole world will see it.

518
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,500
I'm just ... I am worried that I will take.

519
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,500
Do not go anywhere, Mom.

520
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,500
Ithi promit.

01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,250
Swanwick generals. Dle?

522
01:01:18,285 --> 01:01:20,500
What about that thing.

523
01:01:20,535 --> 01:01:22,500
Comet? Asteroid?

524
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,500
Comets and not corrected course, General.

525
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,500
I wanted to see it before as an amateur with a telescope

526

sã creeze o isterie.

527
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,500
It seems that the ship managed to insinuate the monthly secret path.

528
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,965
But we have no idea why.

529
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,500
I tried ... to communicate with her?

530
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,500
Well, not yet responded.

531
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,500
Only speculate ...

532
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,500
but I think who is on board that ship looking

533
01:01:56,535 --> 01:01:58,500
make a dramatic entrance.

534
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,500
Anybody know where pf toner cartridges?

01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,500
- What is happening? - Is the news.

536
01:02:09,535 --> 01:02:11,500
You need to see this.

537
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,250
Clark!

538
01:02:40,285 --> 01:02:42,500
Da ... Vin.

My name is General Zod.

01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,500

546
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,500
We traveled through a sea of ​​stars to reach you.

547
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,500
For a while your world has lost one of my citizens.

548
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,500

01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,500
For reasons unknown ... and chose to keep

existenþa un secret.

552
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,500
Made efforts to integrate.

553
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,965
Arata ca va voi ...

554
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,500
But it is one of yours.

555
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,500
You who you know the current location

556
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,250
fate of your planet

557
01:05:08,285 --> 01:05:10,500
stays in your hands.

558
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,500
Kal-El, I will say this:

559
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,500
Teach Yourself in 24 hours

560
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,500
or concerns about how this world suffer the consequences.

561
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,965
If you do not want us any harm

562
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,965
then will teach his people

563
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,500
And shall bear the consequences. And if you do not do this ...

564
01:05:51,535 --> 01:05:52,965
maybe you should do us.

565
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,500
Lande laws, the Daily Planet º cine este tie.

566
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,500
And I think it would have to interrogate her.

567
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,250
Look at it this sucks?

568
01:06:03,285 --> 01:06:04,965
Runs all morning.

569
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,250
Once in my life I agree with him.

570
01:06:07,285 --> 01:06:09,392
- Have you seen? You know where it is? - No.

571
01:06:09,427 --> 01:06:11,500
And you're right if I did not I would say.

572
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:13,500
The whole world is threatened.

573
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,500
It is time you hold the integrity of journalism.

574
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,965
This is serious, Lois.

575
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,500
The FBI is here. Formulate charged with treason.

576
01:06:23,535 --> 01:06:25,500
I have to go.

577
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,500
FBI hands up!

578
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,500
According to officials, visitors do not present a threat.

579
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,500
Yet it is a question on everyone's mind.

580
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,500
This person Kal-El there?

581
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,500
Haide Kent!

582
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,250
Haide, riposteazã!

583
01:07:26,285 --> 01:07:28,500
Ridicã to Kent!

584
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,965
That's it?

585
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,500
That's all you can?

586
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,500
Haide Kent!

587
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,500
Heath!

588
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,500
Te-au rãnit?

589
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,965
You know well that I can not.

590
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,500
That's not what I meant. I know you're right.

591
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,500
I wanted to hurt that kid. I wanted to hurt him much.

592
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,500
I know you wanted. A part of me wanted.

593
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,965
But then what was?

594
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,500
You would feel better?

595
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,500
You have to decide what kind of man you want to be, because ...

596
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,500
that character will be good or bad,

597
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,500
will change the world.

598
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,500
What are you thinking?

599
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,500
- I do not know where to start. - Where you want.

600
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,500
The ship appeared last night ...

601
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,500
I am the one you seek.

602
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,965
ªtii...

603
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,500
- Why would you? - No.

604
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,965
But this general Zod,

605
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,500
even if I teach, there is no guarantee that, and will keep the word.

606
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,500
This sound loop ° salvez Earth predându-han.

607
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,500
You should take advantage of it?

608
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,250
What your God tell you?

609
01:09:30,285 --> 01:09:32,500
Zod is not reliable.

610
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,965
Problem this ...

611
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,500
I'm not sure that people on Earth can be trusted.

612
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,500
First you have to trust.

613
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,500
Part of the confidence comes later.

614
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,500
Bine at s will find atenþia.

615
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,500
- What? - I'd like to speak to Lois Lane.

616
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,250
What makes you think it's here?

617
01:10:27,285 --> 01:10:29,500
Do not play with me, General.

618
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,965
Ma voi surrender.

619
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,500
But only if I will guarantee freedom Lois.

620
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,500
Why surrender to Zod?

621
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,500
I surrender in the face of mankind.

622
01:10:49,535 --> 01:10:50,965
This diferenþã.

623
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,500
He and the man to come to you?

624
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,500
This would not surrender if I oppose.

625
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,500
And that would make them feel safer.

626
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,500
And everything is for the best.

627
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,500
What does the S's?

628
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,965
It is an S.

629
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,500
In my world means hope.

630
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,500
Here is an S.

631
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,500
How about ...

632
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,965
Super...

633
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,500
Sir ... My name is Dr. ..

634
01:11:34,535 --> 01:11:35,965
Emil Hamilton.

635
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,500
I know. We can see the badge on top pocket

636
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,500
together with those ...

637
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,500
Also see the team in the other room

638
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,250
with those tranquilizers.

639
01:11:48,285 --> 01:11:49,965
You will not need them.

640
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,500
So do not expect me not to take precautions.

641
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,500
You can wear some sort of alien pathogen.

642
01:11:55,535 --> 01:11:57,517
I'm here for 33 years, Doctor.

643
01:11:57,552 --> 01:11:58,965
I have not infected anyone.

644
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,500
But we know her. We grounds of security concerns.

645
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,500
Thi-ai arãtat identity Lane CIDE.

646
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,500
Why do not you do the same with us?

647
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,500
Put books on the table, General.

648
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,500
I hold off because I can not control it.

649
01:12:15,535 --> 01:12:17,500
You can not and you know it.

650
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,500
But that does not mean that you are the enemy.

651
01:12:21,535 --> 01:12:23,500
Then who is? Zod?

652
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,500
That worried me.

653
01:12:26,535 --> 01:12:28,500
Chiar º and º a,

654
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,500

655
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,500
Do what you do, General.

656
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,500
- Thank you. - For what?

657
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,500
Because you believed in me.

658
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,500
Did not make much difference.

659
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,500
He did for me.

660
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,500
Lois ...

661
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,965
Kal-El.

662
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,250
They are under the command of ...

663
01:14:36,285 --> 01:14:38,500
On behalf of General Zod,

664
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,500
Do you greetings.

665
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,500
You're the senior officer here?

666
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,250
- I am. - General Zod would like ...

667
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:52,500
this woman to accompany me.

668
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,500
You asked the alien.

669
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,500
No one said anything of ours.

670
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,500
To tell General

671
01:15:02,535 --> 01:15:03,965
that you opuneþi?

672
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,500
I do not care what they say.

673
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,250
In regular.

674
01:15:10,285 --> 01:15:12,500
I'll go.

675
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,500
The composition of our atmosphere is not compatible with the human

676
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,500
From now on you have to gates so that.

677
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,500
Kal-El. You have no idea of ​​when you bail.

678
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,965
To understand that you're Zod.

679
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,250
General Zod, our commander.

680
01:16:38,285 --> 01:16:40,500
Okay. We can provide a break.

681
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,500
Stranger to our customs.

682
01:16:45,535 --> 01:16:47,500
We should celebrate,

683
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,500
nu sã ne ciondãnim.

684
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,500
I feel out of sorts.

685
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,965
What is happening?

686
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,500
Reject our vessel atmosphere.

687
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,500
He had to adjust to a life on earth,

688
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,500
- But not adapted our atmosphere. - Help him

689
01:17:12,535 --> 01:17:13,965
Nu am cum.

690
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,500
Whatever happens he must fight alone.

691
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,500
S patronage-l!

692
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,500

693
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,500
Turn, Kal-El.

694
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,965
Or want to tell Clark?

695
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,500
's Name Did they gave her, so it?

696
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,965
I was military leader of Krypton.

697
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,965
Your father was the best scientist

698
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,250
The only thing that I both agree

699
01:17:50,285 --> 01:17:51,965
was that the planet was dying.

700
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,500
In return for our efforts to protect our civilization,

701
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,965
º i ne a scathing Planet,

702
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,965
I together with my officers

703
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,500
I was comadamnaþi in the Phantom.

704
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,500
The destruction of our world

705
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,500

706
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,500

708
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,965
Cum ai gãsit Earth?

709
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,500
I managed to replicate projector Phantom

710
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,965
în Hiperpropulsie.

711
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,500
Your father making similar changes vessel that brought you here.

712
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,500
Thus the device that destroyed us

713
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,500
became our salvation.

714
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,500
I look for signs of life on the old colonial post

715
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,500
for signs of life.

716
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,500
We found only death.

717
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,500
Isolated Krypton these outposts have gone long ago.

718
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,500
I saved everything I could.

719
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,965
Armor, weapons.

720
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,500
Even the engine world.

721
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,500
For 33 years we have prepared.

722
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,500
Until we detected a signal triggered by you

723
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,500
When you find ancient ship recognition.

724
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,500
You are not invited pairs of her.

725
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,500
Now save your race debris is in your hands.

726
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,500
On Krypton genetic material of each

727
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,500
beings who must be born citizens is registered.

728
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,965
Your father stolen register

729
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,500
And put in the capsule that brought you here.

730
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,965
For what purpose?

731
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,500
For Krypton to live again

732
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,500
pe Earth.

733
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,500
Unde this Codexul, Kal?

734
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,500
For krypton to live,

735
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,500
what will happen to the Earth?

736
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,500
Foundation must be built on something.

737
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,500
Even dad admitted it.

738
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,500
No!

739
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,500
Not be a part of it.

740
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,500
But then part of what you can do?

741
01:20:48,535 --> 01:20:50,500
No!

742
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,500
º definition of these!

743
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,500
No!

744
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,500
Kal, your father was acquitted with honor.

745
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,500
- You killed him. - That's right.

746
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,500
And not a day goes by that I haunt.

747
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,500
But if I had to do it again, I'd do it.

748
01:21:20,535 --> 01:21:22,500
I have a duty towards my people.

749
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,500
And I will not allow anyone to stand in my way.

750
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,965
What is the situation, Major?

751
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,500
Received two ships were launched from the alien ship.

752
01:21:49,535 --> 01:21:51,500
- Put them on screen. - Yes, sir.

753
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,500
Here they are. Skip the DEFCOM 4.

754
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,250
Commander, the word is Trident.

755
01:21:59,285 --> 01:22:01,500
Douã ship extraterestre appropriates.

756
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,250
4 DefCom this operaþional.

757
01:22:04,285 --> 01:22:06,500
- Speed? - 380 knots.

758
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,250
Do not answer calls.

759
01:22:09,285 --> 01:22:11,500
Do you waste the effort.

760
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,500
The power of eye exposure to the sun Earth

761
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,500
was neutralized on board.

762
01:22:17,535 --> 01:22:19,500
Here, in this environment,

763
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,500
're weak as a man.

764
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,250
Where did you come from?

765
01:23:23,285 --> 01:23:24,965
The control panel.

766
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,500
Thanks to you we ship was loaded into the server.

767
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,500
Who are you?

768
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,500
TATAL lui sunt Kal.

769
01:23:33,535 --> 01:23:35,500
Can you help us?

770
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,965
I designed the ship.

771
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,500
Ii pot modification compoziþia Atmospheric

772
01:23:41,535 --> 01:23:42,965
for compatible people.

773
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,500
We can stop them. We can send Phantom Zone.

774
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,965
How?

775
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,500
You can learn. And while you can learn it on Kal.

776
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,500
The MA vei s patronage?

777
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,500
The core vessel is overloaded. We have to move too fast.

778
01:24:10,535 --> 01:24:12,500
Introduction full of commands.

779
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,500
- You did this? - Yes.

780
01:24:21,535 --> 01:24:23,500
Almost weapon.

781
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,500
What is happening?

782
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,500
Right!

783
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,500
In the face!

784
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,500
Make yourself inside the capsule.

785
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,965
Journey.

786
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,500
It is unlikely to see you.

787
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,500
Just remember, Ghost engines are essential to stop.

788
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,500
You must do this.

789
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,500
It's true what Zod said the codex?

790
01:25:56,535 --> 01:25:58,500
Love fish that panel.

791
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,500
First you need to get used to what it means to be human

792
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,500
that someday, when the time is appropriate

793
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,500
to be a bridge between the two peoples.

794
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,500
Prive º te.

795
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,500
Pot O snub, Kal.

796
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,500
You can save them all.

797
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,500
You'll be safe here.

798
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,500
Eºti bine?

799
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,500
I'm sorry.

800
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,500
I did not want to say anything about you, but I have done something

801
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
- They looked in my mind. - Lois ...

802
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:04,500
And me have done the same thing.

803
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,500
Clark!

804
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,500
The ship has arrived.

805
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,500
Unde this?

806
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,500
Du-te varied!

807
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,500
There!

808
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,500
Codex is not here.

809
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
- Where to hide? - Do not know.

810
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:22,500
Codexul unde this?

811
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,500
You think you can hurt me mom?

812
01:30:02,018 --> 01:30:03,318
Jump in!

813
01:30:20,519 --> 01:30:22,119
What did you do?

814
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:26,120
My parents taught me to control my senses

815
01:30:28,121 --> 01:30:32,021
to focus on what I see.

816
01:30:32,322 --> 01:30:34,822
Fãrã cascã, eºti vulnerabil

817
01:30:36,423 --> 01:30:39,123
And hurts, does not it?

818

Plecaþi the ferestre!

819
01:31:28,925 --> 01:31:31,125
Jump in! It's not safe.

820
01:31:35,526 --> 01:31:38,626
Everything is okay, this guard. I am the commander of the mission.

821
01:31:38,627 --> 01:31:43,627
Recently I encountered enemies nearby.

822
01:31:43,628 --> 01:31:48,028
They are very dangerous and i We are Authorized to use force.

823
01:31:50,329 --> 01:31:52,629
Receive. We are above the target.

824
01:31:58,030 --> 01:32:01,030
- Weapons on. - Receive.

825
01:32:04,031 --> 01:32:06,231
We have three targets.

826
01:32:23,332 --> 01:32:26,832
Thunder 1-1, good hit. We demand an immediate attack.

827
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:31,033
Receive.

828
01:32:53,435 --> 01:32:55,235
We have an enemy in the area.

829
01:33:15,236 --> 01:33:19,236
You're weak, son of El. Unsure of himself.

830
01:33:24,137 --> 01:33:28,037
You defects possess a sense of morality

831
01:33:28,137 --> 01:33:31,437
º i good îþi sacrificial un avantaj evoluþionar.

832
01:33:35,338 --> 01:33:37,638
And if history has shown anything ...

833
01:33:47,639 --> 01:33:51,139
Evolution is that always wins.

834
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:16,140
Go deeper.

835
01:34:16,341 --> 01:34:17,441
Let's go.

836
01:34:19,642 --> 01:34:20,642
Let's go.

837
01:34:57,843 --> 01:35:00,943
We need employees enemies.

838
01:35:00,944 --> 01:35:03,944
Guard, what about the giant blue.

839
01:35:03,945 --> 01:35:05,945
Employees all Targets.

840
01:35:28,646 --> 01:35:29,746

Aterizãm dur.

842
01:35:38,148 --> 01:35:42,348
Prepare for impact.

843
01:35:47,149 --> 01:35:51,749
Again, it's down!

844
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:17,550
Gardian, recepþionezi?

845
01:36:17,551 --> 01:36:20,451
1-2 guard here. I want You send

846
01:36:20,452 --> 01:36:24,252
all you have to my position.

847
01:36:24,453 --> 01:36:25,753
Good luck, sir.

848
01:37:05,554 --> 01:37:08,154
A good death is that its blade.

849
01:37:22,055 --> 01:37:23,275
You will not win.

850
01:37:24,676 --> 01:37:28,155
For every man saved, we will kill one million.

851
01:38:20,956 --> 01:38:23,256
All clear?

852
01:38:24,457 --> 01:38:27,457
Alpha team, you receive?

853
01:39:17,258 --> 01:39:23,058
- This man is not our enemy. - Thank you, Colonel.

854
01:39:41,659 --> 01:39:42,659
Mom!

855
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:45,060
I'm fine.

856
01:39:57,319 --> 01:39:58,919
Nice suit, son.

857
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:01,520
I'm so sorry.

858
01:40:02,521 --> 01:40:08,021
They're just things, Clark. Can always be replaced.

859
01:40:10,822 --> 01:40:12,122
But you you can not be replaced.

860
01:40:13,523 --> 01:40:16,572
Mom said that this codex Zod that it seeks

861
01:40:16,573 --> 01:40:18,323
I might revive people.

862
01:40:19,024 --> 01:40:20,624
Is not that a good thing?

863
01:40:24,625 --> 01:40:27,125
I do not think I'm interested to preþuiascã this world.

864
01:40:27,826 --> 01:40:28,826
Clark!

865
01:40:29,827 --> 01:40:30,827
Clark!

866
01:40:32,628 --> 01:40:34,228
I know how to stop them.

867
01:40:36,629 --> 01:40:41,129
- What happened there? - You showed a temporary weakness.

868
01:40:41,930 --> 01:40:47,730
Is of little importance, because we have located the codex.

869
01:40:48,731 --> 01:40:51,131
It was never the capsule.

870
01:40:51,832 --> 01:40:53,532
Jor-El took codex.

871
01:40:53,733 --> 01:40:55,630
DNA of a billion people

872
01:40:55,831 --> 01:40:59,133
that individual cells bound son.

873
01:40:59,334 --> 01:41:04,834
And i follow all Kryptonians, living in a refugee body.

874
01:41:09,135 --> 01:41:14,235
Kal-El has to be alive when we extract from cells codex's?

875
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:16,536
No.

876
01:41:22,537 --> 01:41:24,737
Release the motor world.

877
01:41:57,238 --> 01:41:59,738
- What happened? - The ship broke up into two.

878
01:41:59,739 --> 01:42:03,139
The first separator heading east, the second points to the southern hemisphere.

879
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:04,740
How fast moving enemy ships?

880
01:42:04,741 --> 01:42:07,141
Approaching Mach 24 and accelerates.

881
01:42:07,442 --> 01:42:10,042
It seems that the impact will be somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean.

882
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:30,743
The rest of the ship lands.

883
01:42:31,444 --> 01:42:32,544
Put it on the board now.

884
01:42:32,745 --> 01:42:33,545
Da, domnule.

885
01:42:34,346 --> 01:42:35,646
Lord!

886
01:43:16,547 --> 01:43:18,747
Activate Phantom propeller.

887
01:43:40,948 --> 01:43:43,248
We have the power of our finite world.

888
01:43:44,349 --> 01:43:45,349
Iniþiaþi!

889
01:44:19,050 --> 01:44:20,550
If we would hit her?

890
01:44:21,751 --> 01:44:24,251
Stop Dog Arma gravitaþionalã.

891
01:44:24,252 --> 01:44:26,852
Working in tandem with their ship.

892
01:44:27,253 --> 01:44:33,053
Cumva mãresc masa Terrei acoperind atmosphere cu particule.

893
01:44:34,654 --> 01:44:35,954
Lord!

894
01:44:37,655 --> 01:44:38,955
Terraformeazã.

895
01:44:39,256 --> 01:44:40,356
What is this?

896
01:44:40,857 --> 01:44:44,957
Planetary Engineering by changing the Earth's atmosphere and thermography.

897
01:44:44,958 --> 01:44:47,058
Turn Earth into Krypron.

898
01:44:47,359 --> 01:44:52,959
- What happened to us? - According to these data, we will not exist.

899
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:54,560
Domnule General Swanwick.

900
01:44:54,561 --> 01:44:55,951
I connected with the tower.

901
01:44:55,952 --> 01:44:58,761
Colonel Hardy is on his way and he's got Superman that trailer.

902
01:44:59,062 --> 01:45:00,183
Superman?

903
01:45:00,784 --> 01:45:03,762
Alien, sir. So tell. Superman.

904
01:45:09,963 --> 01:45:11,563
A Hail Mary plan, generale.

905
01:45:11,764 --> 01:45:13,264
It's what I think?

906
01:45:14,165 --> 01:45:15,765
Iþan ship's equipment.

907
01:45:17,566 --> 01:45:20,066
The ship is powered by a propeller called the Ghost.

908
01:45:20,367 --> 01:45:24,167
Advanced space. Zod vessels using the same technology.

909
01:45:24,168 --> 01:45:26,568
If we can do two engines to collide ...

910
01:45:26,569 --> 01:45:28,369
... Singularity can be created.

911
01:45:28,370 --> 01:45:29,970
- Laura neagrã of Ca? - Good.

912
01:45:29,971 --> 01:45:31,321
So if we open this hole

913
01:45:31,322 --> 01:45:33,871
then theoretically could be drawn absorbed.

914
01:45:33,872 --> 01:45:36,572
So you bombard them with this?

915
01:45:36,573 --> 01:45:38,308
General, the size of that ship

916
01:45:38,309 --> 01:45:41,673
more than seven tons, we will be able launch of the C-17.

917
01:45:42,274 --> 01:45:43,674
It's a good plan

918
01:45:43,675 --> 01:45:46,075
What if I do not stop me and Inari in the Indian Ocean

919
01:45:46,076 --> 01:45:49,076
gravitational field will continue to expand.

920
01:45:55,077 --> 01:46:00,377
If that thing is like Krypton, not weaken it near it?

921
01:46:01,478 --> 01:46:05,778
Maybe so. But I will not let that stop me.

922
01:46:06,979 --> 01:46:08,879
Maybe you should wait a little behind.

923
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:12,580
Maybe a little behind.

924
01:46:45,081 --> 01:46:48,481
- Faora-Ul, take charge! - Yes, sir.

925
01:46:48,482 --> 01:46:50,636
I want to make room Genesis

926
01:46:51,537 --> 01:46:53,982
And let me say goodbye to an old friend.

927
01:47:01,983 --> 01:47:04,183
Guardian is to route to Metropolis.

928
01:47:04,784 --> 01:47:06,184
The package is intact.

929
01:48:00,985 --> 01:48:04,885
ACCEPT command key. Genesis camera is activated, sir.

930
01:48:05,886 --> 01:48:08,686
Something was happening. There's still time?

931
01:48:10,187 --> 01:48:12,487
You stopped me THII speeches, is not it?

932
01:48:12,488 --> 01:48:13,688
Even in death.

933
01:48:14,089 --> 01:48:18,089
- I'll let you uses your codex and a - You have the power to stop me.

934
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:21,290
Key command I entered Did revoked authority.

935
01:48:21,291 --> 01:48:23,991
This ship is now under my control.

936
01:48:55,992 --> 01:48:57,125
Northcom, Lightning 1.

937
01:48:57,126 --> 01:48:58,992
Permission to let go hunting dogs.

938
01:48:58,993 --> 01:49:01,293
Northcom.
Lightning 1, eºti liber sã ataci.

939
01:49:01,294 --> 01:49:03,994
Send the final battle damage. Done.

940
01:49:17,295 --> 01:49:19,195
Rockets go wrong.

941
01:49:19,196 --> 01:49:22,296
Gravitational field pulls us. We must away!

942
01:49:27,297 --> 01:49:31,597
Okay, everyone. Left. Leave the building now.

943
01:49:54,598 --> 01:49:56,398
Just lost my wing aircraft.

944
01:49:58,499 --> 01:50:00,399
SOSSOSSOS

945
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:13,340
Everyone inside.

946
01:50:15,541 --> 01:50:16,741
Mi-º Cathi vain! Mi-º Cathi vain!

947
01:50:23,742 --> 01:50:24,942
Jenny!

948
01:50:28,143 --> 01:50:29,743
Lord!

949
01:50:29,944 --> 01:50:31,244
Mary!

950
01:50:35,245 --> 01:50:36,745
Heath!

951
01:50:42,946 --> 01:50:44,846
Our people can coexist.

952
01:50:45,247 --> 01:50:48,023
As to suffer years of pain trying to adapt

953
01:50:48,024 --> 01:50:49,347
So how did it and your son.

954
01:50:49,348 --> 01:50:51,248
Talk about genocide.

955
01:50:51,249 --> 01:50:54,849
Yeah, and they argue the merits of a ghost.

956
01:50:55,850 --> 01:50:57,650
But both are ghosts.

957
01:50:57,951 --> 01:50:59,151
Do you see that?

958
01:50:59,852 --> 01:51:01,552
Krypton you Agatha disappeared.

959
01:51:01,553 --> 01:51:04,653
The ship managed to quarantine the invasion smart?

960
01:51:04,654 --> 01:51:05,154
A eºuat.

961
01:51:05,155 --> 01:51:07,455
- I did it. - When you're preparing to remove.

962
01:51:07,456 --> 01:51:08,656
I'm tired of this discussion.

963
01:51:08,657 --> 01:51:10,257
Cue making me will not change anything.

964
01:51:13,058 --> 01:51:16,958
My son is two times stronger than you.

965
01:51:18,959 --> 01:51:23,459
And I will finish what I started. Do you can promise that.

966
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:33,060
Tell me, have memories and consciousness of Jor El ...

967
01:51:34,461 --> 01:51:36,761
You can experience his pain?

968
01:51:38,362 --> 01:51:42,162
I harvest codex of your son's body

969
01:51:42,963 --> 01:51:45,462

970
01:51:45,463 --> 01:51:47,863
over his bones.

971
01:52:45,564 --> 01:52:48,464
Jenny! Jenny, unde e º t I?

972
01:52:48,465 --> 01:52:50,865

973
01:52:50,866 --> 01:52:51,866
Þine-te bine!

Are blocked. I can not release. Are blocked.

975
01:52:55,068 --> 01:52:57,068
It's okay. We'll get you out. All right.

976
01:52:57,069 --> 01:52:58,069
Doar stai lines º Titã.

All right.

980
01:53:02,272 --> 01:53:04,872
Come on. Come here and help me!

981
01:53:08,273 --> 01:53:13,473
Here! Put it underneath. All right. Now!

982
01:53:18,574 --> 01:53:21,774
Is coming soon

983
01:53:22,875 --> 01:53:25,875
Northcom, aici this Gardian. Aven liber lansãm sound?

984
01:53:25,876 --> 01:53:27,176
Nu, Ardian.

985
01:54:45,777 --> 01:54:47,177
A defendant º it.

986
01:54:49,778 --> 01:54:50,739
Northcom, here is the Guardian.

987
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:53,278
Pass the action. We can begin.

988
01:54:53,279 --> 01:54:54,479
Mult Moroc, Ardian.

989
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:57,180
In connection with the package. Do you have a clear path.

990
01:54:57,181 --> 01:54:59,081
Alignment for the last round.

991
01:55:00,082 --> 01:55:01,882
It depends on you and Hamilton, now.

992
01:55:41,783 --> 01:55:42,983
You must be kidding me!

993
01:55:42,984 --> 01:55:43,884
Lord Masters.

994
01:55:43,885 --> 01:55:45,984
The package is ready and we're ready to launch.

995
01:55:45,985 --> 01:55:47,285
No.

996
01:55:47,286 --> 01:55:49,786
Something's wrong. I should do so a

997
01:55:49,787 --> 01:55:51,087
And how should do?

998
01:55:51,088 --> 01:55:53,188
You should go completely.

999
01:55:53,189 --> 01:55:54,289
LASA-han han sound uit.

1000
01:55:54,590 --> 01:55:55,890
Changes on autopilot.

1001
01:55:56,891 --> 01:55:58,091
Changes on autopilot.

1002
01:56:05,292 --> 01:56:08,092
We are close to release. What do we retain?

1003
01:56:08,093 --> 01:56:09,393
A little resistance.

1004
01:56:24,994 --> 01:56:26,594
Þintiþi the aircraft.

1005
01:56:30,295 --> 01:56:31,595
Thinta fixatã.

1006
01:56:41,596 --> 01:56:42,496
Zod!

1007
01:56:42,797 --> 01:56:47,097
If you destroy this ship, you destroy krypton.

1008
01:56:50,498 --> 01:56:52,498
Kryptonul a trap aids º lui.

1009
01:57:46,699 --> 01:57:50,899
Miss Lane! Do not sit there. Miss Lane!

1010
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:21,300
Mi No Dog!

1011
01:58:42,901 --> 01:58:45,601
Look at this. That's your reward total.

1012
01:59:48,102 --> 01:59:51,602
- Are they gone? - I think so.

1013
01:59:54,003 --> 01:59:55,303
Ne-a Salvat.

1014
02:00:20,704 --> 02:00:23,504
You know, they say that everything goes hell after the first kiss.

1015
02:00:27,405 --> 02:00:29,805
I guess it only matters when you kiss human beings.

1016
02:00:59,806 --> 02:01:01,661
Look at this!

1017
02:01:03,262 --> 02:01:07,089
We could build a new Krypton, in this place.

1018
02:01:07,090 --> 02:01:10,407
But you and people you choose us.

1019
02:01:12,008 --> 02:01:16,208
Is there only to protect krypton.

1020
02:01:17,909 --> 02:01:22,209
This is the only purpose for which we were born.

1021
02:01:23,210 --> 02:01:27,310
And any action of mine, no matter how violent is

1022
02:01:27,911 --> 02:01:29,633
or as raw

1023
02:01:30,634 --> 02:01:34,911
is for the greater good of my people.

1024
02:01:39,612 --> 02:01:43,612
And now, I have one.

1025
02:01:47,313 --> 02:01:49,020
My soul ...

1026
02:01:50,321 --> 02:01:55,613
That's what you took.

1027
02:02:03,414 --> 02:02:05,714
I'm going to make them suffer, Kal.

1028
02:02:06,015 --> 02:02:10,715
These people that I've adopted, I will kidnap Did i one by one.

1029
02:02:10,716 --> 02:02:12,116
You're a monster, Zod.

1030
02:02:15,017 --> 02:02:16,717
Then I'll stop.

1031
02:03:57,818 --> 02:04:00,518
It will only end in one way, Kal.

1032
02:04:00,519 --> 02:04:03,419
Whether you die or I will.

1033
02:04:34,120 --> 02:04:36,577
I was raised to be a warrior, Kal,

1034
02:04:37,778 --> 02:04:41,520
trained my whole life, to control my senses.

1035
02:04:41,821 --> 02:04:45,221
Where were you trained? On a farm?

1036
02:06:54,722 --> 02:06:58,281
If you love them so much on these people

1037
02:06:59,182 --> 02:07:01,822
Poth ate dupa ei.

1038
02:07:05,923 --> 02:07:07,423
Do not do it!

1039
02:07:10,424 --> 02:07:11,424
º definition of these!

1040
02:07:17,425 --> 02:07:19,425
º definition of these!

1041
02:08:56,426 --> 02:08:58,060
E º those Prost, Naib ce?

1042
02:08:58,061 --> 02:08:59,626
One of your units fell surveillance.

1043
02:09:00,027 --> 02:09:02,327
This equipment is $ 12 million.

1044
02:09:02,628 --> 02:09:03,828
He was.

1045
02:09:04,729 --> 02:09:06,729
I know you're trying to find out where my cape Agatha.

1046
02:09:07,630 --> 02:09:08,530
Nu woe catch.

1047
02:09:08,531 --> 02:09:10,331
Then I'll ask the obvious question.

1048
02:09:11,132 --> 02:09:14,631
How do we know that one day you will not act against U.S. interests.

1049
02:09:14,632 --> 02:09:16,532
I grew up in Kansas, General.

1050
02:09:16,933 --> 02:09:18,733
I'm American as possible.

1051
02:09:19,434 --> 02:09:24,134
Look, I'm here to help. But you have to be on my terms.

1052
02:09:25,035 --> 02:09:27,035
And you have to convince Washington of this.

1053
02:09:27,036 --> 02:09:31,236
Even if you try, what makes you think they will listen?

1054
02:09:32,037 --> 02:09:36,737
I do not know, General. I think you have to trust you.

1055
02:09:46,538 --> 02:09:49,438
- Why smiles you, Captain? - Nothing, sir.

1056
02:09:52,839 --> 02:09:58,139
- I only very sexy. - Get in the car, Captain.

1057
02:09:58,140 --> 02:09:59,240
Da, domnule.

1058
02:10:09,241 --> 02:10:12,041
Always thought you were destined for greatness things.

1059
02:10:12,842 --> 02:10:16,442
And when the day comes, your shoulders will bear the burden.

1060
02:10:17,443 --> 02:10:20,843
Yes. I would have just wanted to be here to see you finally happened.

1061
02:10:21,644 --> 02:10:23,244
The vãzut it, Clark. Crede-han!

1062
02:11:11,145 --> 02:11:14,245
What are you going to do, you will not save the world?

1063
02:11:14,246 --> 02:11:15,746
You thought a bit?

1064
02:11:15,747 --> 02:11:17,040
I thought, actually.

1065
02:11:19,341 --> 02:11:23,547
You need to look for a job where they can be informed.

1066
02:11:28,748 --> 02:11:33,048
Where people will not forget when I want to go somewhere dangerous.

1067
02:11:34,049 --> 02:11:35,949
starting to ask questions.

1068
02:11:48,850 --> 02:11:51,750
Come on, Lois. Can I have some?

1069
02:11:53,351 --> 02:11:55,151
Places close pitch at the game tonight.

1070
02:11:55,352 --> 02:11:56,152
What?

1071
02:11:56,153 --> 02:11:59,653
Maybe I should say that in addition to patrol internist.

1072
02:11:59,854 --> 02:12:01,354
You probably have better luck.

1073
02:12:01,755 --> 02:12:03,055
I'm sorry.

1074
02:12:05,056 --> 02:12:07,856
- The No oatmeal? - In the face. In the face.

1075
02:12:08,257 --> 02:12:09,941
Lombard, Lane.

1076
02:12:09,942 --> 02:12:11,157
I want to make acquainted with our new employee.

1077
02:12:11,158 --> 02:12:13,858
I want to arãtaþi the deal. This is Clark Kent.

1078
02:12:14,159 --> 02:12:15,059
Success.

1079
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:19,460
Good. Steve, nice to meet you.

1080

Good.

1082
02:12:22,063 --> 02:12:23,263
Lois Lane.

1083
02:12:24,264 --> 02:12:25,464
