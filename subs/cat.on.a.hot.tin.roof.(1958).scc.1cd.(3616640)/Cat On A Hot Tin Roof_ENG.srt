2
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:19,368
Don't you do that!

3
00:04:19,888 --> 00:04:21,688
I'm warning you, Trixie.

4
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:22,528
Gooper!

5
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:25,928
Can't you stop your child
from putting her hands in the ice cream?

6
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:32,848
Couldn't you at least wash your hands
before you did that?

7
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:44,887
Maggie!

8
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:46,927
You stop that!

9
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:49,487
How could you do that to a child?

10
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:52,247
Like this, honey.

11
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:02,647
Did you see what she did?

12
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,847
I told her to wash her hands first.

13
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:24,007
One of those no-neck monsters
hit me with some ice cream.

14
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,326
Why do you call Gooper's kiddies
"no-neck monsters"?

15
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:30,366
Because your brother's children
have got no necks.

16
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:36,286
Their fat little heads sit on their fat bodies
without a bit of connection.

17
00:05:36,446 --> 00:05:37,806
That's too bad.

18
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:41,646
Especially 'cause, if they have no necks
you can't wring them. Right, honey?

19
00:05:45,726 --> 00:05:46,606
Here we are!

20
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:48,126
Come on, Buster, Sonny.

21
00:05:48,286 --> 00:05:50,606
Go get in the car. We're all going to go.

22
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:55,606
Did you ever hear so many dog's names
tagged on to children?

23
00:05:55,806 --> 00:05:59,166
They've got five monsters
and number six coming up.

24
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:03,046
They've brought the whole bunch here
like animals to display at a county fair.

25
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:05,486
It's so obvious, it's disgusting.

26
00:06:05,686 --> 00:06:07,326
It's obvious what they're up to.

27
00:06:07,846 --> 00:06:10,086
What are they up to, Maggie?

28
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:14,445
I'll tell you what they're up to, boy of mine.

29
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:17,765
They're up to cutting you out
of your father's estate.

30
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:20,765
Everybody knows Big Daddy's...

31
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:22,605
...dying of...

32
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:26,925
I ought to send Sister Woman a bill
for a new pair of stockings.

33
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:28,565
Do we?

34
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,925
Do we what?

35
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:33,885
Know that Big Daddy is dying of...

36
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:36,205
Don't you believe it?

37
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,365
You'll know soon enough.

38
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,285
Suppose he is?

39
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:42,285
There's some things you've got to face.

40
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:45,525
There's some things in this world
you've simply got to face.

41
00:06:45,925 --> 00:06:48,845
Why was Big Daddy in that horrible clinic
for six weeks...

42
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:51,165
...if the examination didn't show anything?

43
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:55,245
Why did Brother Man bring his whole tribe
down here in this sticky heat?

44
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:58,444
And why so many allusions
to you and Rainbow Hill?

45
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:00,844
You know what Rainbow Hill is?

46
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:04,564
It's a place that's famous for treating
famous alcoholics and dope fiends.

47
00:07:04,644 --> 00:07:05,924
I'm not famous.

48
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:06,844
No...

49
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:08,684
...and you don't take dope.

50
00:07:08,884 --> 00:07:11,444
Otherwise you'd be a perfect candidate
for Rainbow Hill.

51
00:07:11,644 --> 00:07:14,764
That's where Brother Man's
going to tell Big Daddy to ship you.

52
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:17,204
Over my dead body!

53
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:19,564
Rainbow Hill.

54
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,404
With you out of the way,
Gooper gets hold of the estate...

55
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:28,884
...signs the checks, and cuts off our credit
whenever he wants.

56
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:31,084
How'd you like that, baby?

57
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:33,084
You're doing just about everything...

58
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,844
...to aid and abet them
in grabbing control, after Big Daddy...

59
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,523
Well, you are.

60
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:47,723
Quitting work,
devoting yourself to drinking!

61
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:50,883
Breaking your ankle last night
on the high school field.

62
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:53,283
Brick?

63
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:56,723
We've got one thing on our side.

64
00:07:57,203 --> 00:07:58,363
No, two things.

65
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:00,123
Are my seams straight?

66
00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:02,963
Big Daddy dotes on you, honey.

67
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:06,003
He just can't stand Brother Man
and his wife...

68
00:08:06,203 --> 00:08:08,363
...that fertility monster.
She's odious to him.

69
00:08:08,643 --> 00:08:09,563
I can tell.

70
00:08:09,763 --> 00:08:12,043
Just like I can tell he likes me.

71
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:14,963
That's the second thing
we've got on our side.

72
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:21,963
He likes me.

73
00:08:22,963 --> 00:08:26,642
The way he looks me up and down,
and over...

74
00:08:27,642 --> 00:08:29,562
He's still got an eye for girls.

75
00:08:29,762 --> 00:08:31,762
That kind of talk is disgusting.

76
00:08:33,282 --> 00:08:36,642
Anybody ever tell you
you were a back-aching Puritan?

77
00:08:37,002 --> 00:08:40,242
I think it's mighty fine how that old fellow,
on death's doorstep...

78
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:43,722
...takes in my shape with what
I consider deserved appreciation.

79
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:49,722
Gooper still cherishes the illusion
he took a giant step up the social ladder...

80
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:53,202
...when he married Mae Flynn
of the no-neck Memphis Flynns...

81
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:55,962
...because she was queen
of the Cotton Carnival.

82
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:58,922
I can just see Gooper
falling for Her Majesty...

83
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:03,082
...sitting on that brass throne,
riding that tacky float down Main Street...

84
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:08,002
...smiling and bowing, and blowing kisses
to all the trash on the street.

85
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,041
You know what happened to her?

86
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:12,921
No, what happened to her?

87
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,681
Somebody spat tobacco juice in her face.

88
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:20,321
Some drunk at the Hotel Gayoso
leaned out the window and said:

89
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:23,241
"Hey, Queenie!"

90
00:09:23,441 --> 00:09:26,721
Sister Mae looked up and smiled
and waved...

91
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:30,041
...and that drunk shot a squirt
of tobacco juice...

92
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:32,161
...right in her face.

93
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,801
Why are you looking at me like that?

94
00:09:46,841 --> 00:09:48,721
Like what?

95
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:51,001
Like you were just looking.

96
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:55,321
I wasn't conscious of looking at you.

97
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,600
I was conscious of it.

98
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,320
- Lf you were thinking the same thing...
- No, Maggie!

99
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,960
- Why not?
- Will you please keep your voice down?

100
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,440
No!

101
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,600
I know you better than you think.

102
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,600
I've seen that look before...

103
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,560
...and I know what it used to mean.

104
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,120
- And it still means the same thing now.
- You're not the same woman now, Maggie.

105
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,720
Don't you think I know that?

106
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,480
- Don't you think I know...
- Know what, Maggie?

107
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,920
That I've gone through
this horrible transformation.

108
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,280
I've become hard and frantic and cruel.

109
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,879
Are you planning on meeting
Big Daddy's plane?

110
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,639
I get so Ionely.

111
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:54,959
Everybody gets that.

112
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:59,439
Living with somebody you love can be...

113
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,359
...Ionelier than living entirely alone...

114
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:05,559
...when the one you love doesn't love you.

115
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,319
You can't even stand
drinking out of the same glass, can you?

116
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,759
Would you like to live alone?

117
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:21,959
No!

118
00:11:27,798 --> 00:11:29,638
No, I wouldn't.

119
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:35,358
Why can't you lose your good looks, Brick?

120
00:11:35,558 --> 00:11:37,558
Most drinking men lose theirs.

121
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:39,278
Why can't you?

122
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:43,918
I think you've even got better looking
since you went on the bottle.

123
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,798
You were such a wonderful lover.

124
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:50,638
You'll be late!

125
00:11:51,318 --> 00:11:53,478
You were so exciting to be in love with.

126
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:55,758
Mostly, I guess, because you were...

127
00:12:01,238 --> 00:12:02,958
If I thought you'd...

128
00:12:03,238 --> 00:12:05,998
...never make love to me again...

129
00:12:08,998 --> 00:12:13,597
...I'd find the longest, sharpest knife
and stick it straight into my heart.

130
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,077
I'd do that.

131
00:12:20,597 --> 00:12:23,797
How long does this have to go on,
this punishment?

132
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:26,677
Haven't I served my term?
Can I get a pardon?

133
00:12:26,837 --> 00:12:31,637
Your finishing-school voice sounds like
you were running upstairs to say, "Fire!"

134
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:35,037
Is it any wonder?

135
00:12:35,877 --> 00:12:37,837
You know what I feel like?

136
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:40,597
I feel all the time like a cat
on a hot tin roof.

137
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:42,357
Then jump off the roof, Maggie.

138
00:12:42,557 --> 00:12:46,037
Cats jump off roofs and land uninjured.
Do it. Jump.

139
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:47,157
Jump where?

140
00:12:47,357 --> 00:12:48,717
Into what?

141
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:50,477
Take a lover.

142
00:12:52,677 --> 00:12:54,637
I don't deserve that!

143
00:13:00,756 --> 00:13:03,316
I can't see any man but you.

144
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:08,036
Even with my eyes closed, I just see you.

145
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:14,996
Why can't you get ugly, Brick?

146
00:13:15,156 --> 00:13:19,036
Why can't you get fat or ugly or something,
so I can stand it?

147
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:23,556
You'll make out fine.
Your kind always does.

148
00:13:23,756 --> 00:13:25,716
I'm more determined than you think.

149
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,716
I'll win all right.

150
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,236
Win what?

151
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:33,876
What is the victory
of a cat on a hot tin roof?

152
00:13:37,996 --> 00:13:40,436
Just staying on it, I guess...

153
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:42,515
...as long as she can.

154
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:56,915
Calm down. Not yet. Now wait a minute.

155
00:13:57,155 --> 00:13:58,355
Where are the flowers?

156
00:13:58,515 --> 00:14:00,915
Aren't you putting it on a little thick?

157
00:14:18,795 --> 00:14:20,195
Get ready, now!

158
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:22,955
Mama, she didn't bring anything
for Big Daddy.

159
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:26,554
Pretty seedy looking flowers
for Big Daddy, huh, Gooper?

160
00:14:26,754 --> 00:14:27,994
I picked them myself.

161
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:30,034
Looks like she picked them off a grave.

162
00:14:30,194 --> 00:14:34,354
Don't talk about graves when we don't
know if Big Daddy's going to live or die.

163
00:14:39,234 --> 00:14:39,954
Get ready.

164
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:47,114
Hello, Mae.

165
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:48,834
Hello, children.

166
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:04,354
Doc, isn't it great?

167
00:15:09,554 --> 00:15:10,114
Kiss me!

168
00:15:11,513 --> 00:15:13,273
Kiss your grandmother.

169
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,313
Darling Big Daddy!

170
00:15:15,473 --> 00:15:17,833
You look fine, Big Daddy.

171
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:20,553
Doc, do you want to tell them the news?

172
00:15:20,913 --> 00:15:24,393
The exploratory operation proved
there's nothing wrong with Big Daddy.

173
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:25,713
Nothing at all!

174
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:28,633
Just a spastic colon. And that's all.

175
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,793
- Great news!
- Isn't that great news?

176
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,553
That's the best birthday present of all.

177
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,073
Where's Brick?

178
00:15:35,273 --> 00:15:37,393
Uncle Brick got drunk and broke his leg.

179
00:15:37,593 --> 00:15:38,953
- How?
- What's that?

180
00:15:39,153 --> 00:15:42,033
Got drunk again and tried to jump
the high hurdles at 3:00 AM.

181
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,433
That poor boy still thinks he's an athlete.

182
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:46,513
Couldn't keep it out of the local paper.

183
00:15:46,593 --> 00:15:47,953
AP got hold of it too.

184
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,673
Yeah, and UP...

185
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:53,553
...and thanks to your professional
legal advice, every other P.

186
00:15:53,993 --> 00:15:55,233
Let's go home.

187
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:57,512
Don't you want to ride with the children?

188
00:15:57,712 --> 00:15:58,992
No!

189
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:02,992
He's his sassy old self again, all right!

190
00:16:03,192 --> 00:16:04,872
Be quiet, woman!

191
00:16:12,832 --> 00:16:14,272
Hush up!

192
00:16:24,472 --> 00:16:25,832
Welcome home, Cap'n Pollitt.

193
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:37,152
I'm going to live, Maggie. I'm going to live.

194
00:16:37,672 --> 00:16:40,272
They had me real scared.

195
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:42,191
I've wasted so much time.

196
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:45,311
I've got a million different kinds
of feelings left in me.

197
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:49,111
And I'm going to use them.
I'm going to use them all.

198
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,390
Why did you and Brick
suddenly drive up from New Orleans?

199
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,430
For your birthday, what else?

200
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,750
I had one last year and the year before.
Didn't see you then.

201
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,030
You know how Brick is sometimes.

202
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,910
Maybe he thought he was coming
to my funeral instead.

203
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,070
Brick loves you! He does!

204
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,630
But does he love you?

205
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,430
What do you want? Proof?

206
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,950
If I was married to you three years...

207
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,150
...you'd have the living proof.

208
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,710
You'd have three kids
and a fourth in the oven.

209
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,190
Get me out of this. I want to talk to Brick.

210
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,509
He wants some more ice, Miss Margaret.

211
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:18,429
"We love you when we're with you

212
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:20,389
"And we love you out of sight

213
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,949
"Big Mama, too"

214
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:41,789
I've got news, honey!

215
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:43,389
Big news.

216
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:45,669
Big Daddy's going to live.

217
00:18:47,949 --> 00:18:50,389
That's right, he's a well man.

218
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:54,109
That's what Big Mama said and Dr. Baugh
was right there with them.

219
00:18:54,389 --> 00:18:56,828
You should've seen Mae and Gooper's face.

220
00:18:57,348 --> 00:18:59,788
They almost dropped dead
from shock themselves.

221
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:00,868
He's all right?

222
00:19:00,988 --> 00:19:02,668
Feeling like 40...

223
00:19:02,828 --> 00:19:04,028
...and talking like 20.

224
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:06,108
And we can drive back
to New Orleans tonight.

225
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:09,228
- I'm taking no chances on moving you.
- I won't break.

226
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:12,948
Or letting them poison
Big Daddy's mind against you.

227
00:19:13,588 --> 00:19:17,548
I just want you to get dressed
and come to Big Daddy's birthday party.

228
00:19:17,828 --> 00:19:21,028
First thing Big Daddy asked about was you.

229
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:23,788
Big Daddy! Now what makes him so big?

230
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:26,748
His big heart, his big belly...

231
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,188
...or his big money?

232
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,628
The heat has made you cross.

233
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:33,348
Give me my crutch.

234
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:38,188
Why don't you put on
your silk pajamas, honey...

235
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:40,308
...and come on down to the party?

236
00:19:40,508 --> 00:19:42,707
There's a lovely cool breeze.

237
00:19:43,387 --> 00:19:45,227
Give me my crutch, Maggie.

238
00:19:46,387 --> 00:19:48,507
Lean on me, baby.

239
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:57,627
You've got a nice smell about you.

240
00:19:59,307 --> 00:20:01,867
- Was your bathwater cool?
- No.

241
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:06,747
I know something
that would make you cool and fresh.

242
00:20:07,627 --> 00:20:09,227
Alcohol rub.

243
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:11,147
Cologne.

244
00:20:11,947 --> 00:20:13,427
No thanks. We'd smell alike.

245
00:20:13,507 --> 00:20:15,987
Like a couple of cats in the heat.

246
00:20:25,787 --> 00:20:27,466
It's cool on the lawn.

247
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:31,746
I am not going down there.
Not for you and not for Big Daddy!

248
00:20:34,506 --> 00:20:36,386
At least give him this present...

249
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:39,986
...that I remembered to buy for you,
for his birthday.

250
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:42,426
Just write a few words on this card.

251
00:20:42,626 --> 00:20:44,106
You write something.

252
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:47,746
It's got to be your handwriting.
It's your present.

253
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,306
I didn't get him a present.

254
00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:50,746
What's the difference?

255
00:20:50,946 --> 00:20:53,026
If there's no difference, you write the card!

256
00:20:53,106 --> 00:20:55,946
- And have him know you didn't remember?
- I didn't remember!

257
00:20:56,106 --> 00:20:58,066
You don't have to prove it to him!

258
00:20:58,266 --> 00:21:00,346
Just write, "Love, Brick"...

259
00:21:00,546 --> 00:21:01,706
...for heaven's sake!

260
00:21:01,866 --> 00:21:04,746
- You've got to.
- I don't have to do anything!

261
00:21:04,946 --> 00:21:08,066
You forget the conditions I agreed on
to stay living with you!

262
00:21:08,146 --> 00:21:12,105
I'm not living with you.
We occupy the same cage, that's all!

263
00:21:20,105 --> 00:21:24,425
That's the first time you've raised
your voice in a long time.

264
00:21:27,105 --> 00:21:28,545
A crack in the stone wall?

265
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:37,065
I think that's a fine sign. Mighty fine.

266
00:21:42,545 --> 00:21:43,745
What did you do that for?

267
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,185
To give us a little privacy for a while.

268
00:21:51,265 --> 00:21:53,105
Don't make a fool of yourself.

269
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,624
I don't mind making a fool
of myself over you.

270
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:02,264
I mind. I feel embarrassed for you.

271
00:22:02,664 --> 00:22:04,024
Feel embarrassed!

272
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:06,024
I can't live on this way.

273
00:22:06,184 --> 00:22:10,104
- You agreed to accept that condition!
- I know I did, but I can't!

274
00:22:12,304 --> 00:22:13,464
Let go.

275
00:22:19,624 --> 00:22:21,344
Let go, Maggie!

276
00:22:38,544 --> 00:22:39,784
Son!

277
00:22:42,263 --> 00:22:45,063
We've got the most wonderful news
about Big Daddy!

278
00:22:45,423 --> 00:22:46,983
What's this door doing locked?

279
00:22:47,143 --> 00:22:49,383
You think there's robbers in the house?

280
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,383
Brick's getting dressed, Big Mama.

281
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:53,863
He's still getting dressed.

282
00:22:54,063 --> 00:22:56,983
It won't be the first time
I've seen Brick not dressed.

283
00:22:57,183 --> 00:22:58,463
Open this door.

284
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:09,543
Brick, honey!

285
00:23:09,703 --> 00:23:11,423
Sweetheart, how does your leg feel?

286
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:14,663
Come out of there. I want to give you
the news about Big Daddy.

287
00:23:14,823 --> 00:23:16,863
I told him already.

288
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,983
I just hate locked doors in the house.

289
00:23:19,183 --> 00:23:22,623
I know you do
but people need privacy, don't they?

290
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:24,903
No, ma'am, not in my house.

291
00:23:25,063 --> 00:23:28,342
What did you take this off for?
It looked so sweet on you.

292
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,902
Not sweet enough
for Big Daddy's birthday party.

293
00:23:32,382 --> 00:23:33,382
Out!

294
00:23:34,822 --> 00:23:35,942
Out, you little monster!

295
00:23:43,262 --> 00:23:46,502
Mae and Gooper are so touchy
about their children.

296
00:23:46,662 --> 00:23:50,462
You hardly even dare suggest
there's any room for improvement.

297
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,142
Brick, hurry on out!

298
00:23:52,342 --> 00:23:55,142
Shoot, Maggie, you just don't like children.

299
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:57,822
Why that's not true. I adore them.

300
00:23:58,022 --> 00:23:59,142
Well brought up.

301
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:01,622
Why not have some, then,
and bring them up well?

302
00:24:01,702 --> 00:24:04,542
- Instead of picking on theirs?
- Big Mama!

303
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:07,622
Hugh and Betsy have got to go.
They're waiting to say goodbye.

304
00:24:07,702 --> 00:24:10,382
I'll be right down.
Tell them to hold their horses.

305
00:24:11,941 --> 00:24:12,821
Where's Brick?

306
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:24,901
What you said about having children...

307
00:24:25,061 --> 00:24:27,061
It's still kind of a secret, but...

308
00:24:28,621 --> 00:24:31,461
Shoot, Maggie! Stop playing so dumb.

309
00:24:31,741 --> 00:24:33,741
Is he still drinking this stuff much?

310
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:38,181
- He may have had a little highball.
- Don't laugh about it.

311
00:24:38,381 --> 00:24:41,301
Some men stop drinking when they marry.
Others start.

312
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:43,461
- He never drank before...
- That's not fair!

313
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:46,021
Fair or not, I want to ask you a question.

314
00:24:46,621 --> 00:24:48,021
Do you make Brick happy?

315
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:50,461
Well?

316
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:55,381
- Why don't you ask if he makes me happy?
- I know...

317
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:56,460
It works both ways.

318
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,780
Something ain't right.
You're childless and my son drinks.

319
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,660
- We're leaving, Big Mama.
- I'm coming!

320
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,940
When a marriage goes on the rocks...

321
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,740
...the rocks are there, right there!

322
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,220
Goodbye, Ida.

323
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,980
I'm coming.

324
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,900
That's not fair.

325
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,100
All right, I'm coming.

326
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,340
Is Brick here?

327
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,300
I thought I'd check his ankle.

328
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,220
Is it giving him much pain?

329
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,740
You know how Brick is, Doc.
He hardly ever complains.

330
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,500
Even when he had
that awful back injury in football.

331
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:44,779
Brick's birthday present for Big Daddy.

332
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,379
I think they're fixing
to sit down at the table.

333
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:55,819
You forgot to write out the card, honey.

334
00:25:58,819 --> 00:25:59,859
Thanks, Doc.

335
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:08,259
Can I get you something cool?

336
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:10,019
No, thanks.

337
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:12,139
How's the ankle?

338
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:16,419
Itches some.

339
00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:20,699
Funny, that's the same leg
you tore a muscle in the...

340
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:22,339
'Bama State.

341
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,979
Twenty-one to...

342
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:24,859
Nothing.

343
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:27,218
You miss football, don't you?

344
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:29,218
Hurt much when you put weight on it?

345
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:30,378
Some.

346
00:26:30,578 --> 00:26:34,058
Yeah, you were quite a team,
you and Skipper.

347
00:26:36,418 --> 00:26:38,018
What is it, Doc?

348
00:26:38,418 --> 00:26:41,658
You didn't leave that party
to come up and discuss my health.

349
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:42,738
That's right.

350
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:45,298
- I've already heard the good news...
- It's bad news.

351
00:26:46,178 --> 00:26:48,138
It's what we expected.

352
00:26:48,498 --> 00:26:50,618
It's malignant and it's terminal.

353
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,698
He hasn't a chance.

354
00:26:52,898 --> 00:26:55,858
- But Maggie said, and Big Mama...
- Lies.

355
00:26:56,418 --> 00:26:57,658
I lied to them.

356
00:26:58,578 --> 00:27:00,778
I lied to him, too.

357
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:03,018
Professional ethics.

358
00:27:04,738 --> 00:27:05,258
Gooper?

359
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,978
I told him the truth
coming in from the airfield.

360
00:27:08,578 --> 00:27:09,738
He's going to die.

361
00:27:11,537 --> 00:27:13,017
He's going to die.

362
00:27:21,537 --> 00:27:24,577
"Jesus wants me for a sunbeam"

363
00:27:27,217 --> 00:27:29,537
What kind of truth is that?

364
00:27:48,097 --> 00:27:51,017
"Jesus wants me for a sunbeam

365
00:27:51,217 --> 00:27:53,657
"To shine for him each day

366
00:27:55,017 --> 00:27:58,016
"In every way try to please him

367
00:27:58,216 --> 00:28:00,736
"At home, at school, at play

368
00:28:01,536 --> 00:28:02,976
"A sunbeam

369
00:28:05,136 --> 00:28:07,936
"Jesus wants me for a sunbeam

370
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:11,016
"A sunbeam, a sunbeam

371
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,176
"I'll be a sunbeam for him"

372
00:28:14,456 --> 00:28:15,776
Amen!

373
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:19,096
- Did you like the singing, Big Daddy?
- Pass the black-eyed peas.

374
00:28:19,776 --> 00:28:23,136
Look at Big Daddy eat!
Ain't it something to thank your stars for?

375
00:28:23,296 --> 00:28:25,136
They've been practicing just for you.

376
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,416
Tell them to sit and eat.

377
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,376
- Children, come on.
- Over there!

378
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:30,496
Yeah. Over there.

379
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:32,936
Look here. Telegrams!

380
00:28:33,136 --> 00:28:35,696
Hundreds of them from every corner
of this great state...

381
00:28:35,776 --> 00:28:37,056
Wishing you happy birthday.

382
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,776
Do you want me to read them?

383
00:28:38,976 --> 00:28:40,976
One from the governor and the senator...

384
00:28:41,056 --> 00:28:44,095
It must be getting on to election time,
hey, Deacon?

385
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,855
Let's remember,
we're all lambs in the same pasture.

386
00:28:47,055 --> 00:28:50,815
Everybody, including Big Daddy,
owes thanks to those in high places who...

387
00:28:51,015 --> 00:28:52,095
Gave us nothing!

388
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:56,135
Every scrap on this table was raised
right here on this place, Deacon.

389
00:28:56,335 --> 00:29:00,535
I made a pastureland out of this place
when it was nothing but a swamp.

390
00:29:00,735 --> 00:29:03,815
And it was done with the help of God,
and not any governor.

391
00:29:04,095 --> 00:29:04,775
Amen.

392
00:29:04,975 --> 00:29:06,775
"Boom, boom and it makes me crazy"

393
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:08,415
Great balls of fire!

394
00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:09,775
Surprise!

395
00:29:09,975 --> 00:29:12,895
- What are they up to now?
- It's part of the entertainment.

396
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:14,895
Don't they get any intermission?

397
00:29:15,095 --> 00:29:16,575
That's funny!

398
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,415
That's very funny!

399
00:29:18,615 --> 00:29:20,775
He don't mean it, Sister Woman.

400
00:29:20,975 --> 00:29:23,455
- He loves children!
- Of course he does!

401
00:29:23,615 --> 00:29:25,535
Will you put some honey on this?

402
00:29:25,735 --> 00:29:28,734
They're all Pollitts,
I'm proud to say, every one of them.

403
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,534
I know Big Daddy's
just as proud as we are...

404
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:33,854
...that there's a flesh-and-blood dynasty...

405
00:29:34,014 --> 00:29:36,174
...waiting to take over.

406
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,374
That's no way to talk.

407
00:29:38,574 --> 00:29:39,374
What way?

408
00:29:39,574 --> 00:29:43,454
"Take over." When we all know...

409
00:29:43,654 --> 00:29:46,014
...Big Daddy's going to live
to be at least 100.

410
00:29:46,094 --> 00:29:47,654
I'll drink to that!

411
00:29:48,014 --> 00:29:50,094
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere!

412
00:29:50,294 --> 00:29:51,934
To Big Daddy!

413
00:29:53,414 --> 00:29:55,934
In the name of every person
in this county...

414
00:29:56,014 --> 00:29:59,414
...in the name of the church
and school board, the board of trustees...

415
00:29:59,494 --> 00:30:02,574
...felicitations on your 65th birthday.

416
00:30:03,774 --> 00:30:05,934
Brick, honey,
I brought you something to eat.

417
00:30:06,134 --> 00:30:07,614
I'm not hungry.

418
00:30:10,974 --> 00:30:12,933
What's that supposed to mean?

419
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:14,013
We're leaving.

420
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:15,933
- We can't.
- I can.

421
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:19,653
- The party's coming up here to you.
- I'll get one of the boys to drive me.

422
00:30:19,853 --> 00:30:23,493
You just can't walk out
on Big Daddy's birthday party!

423
00:30:23,693 --> 00:30:25,333
Don't you care nothing about him?

424
00:30:25,413 --> 00:30:26,813
Get out of my way.

425
00:30:27,933 --> 00:30:30,213
Get out of my way, Maggie!

426
00:30:32,693 --> 00:30:34,493
You've got no cause to dislike him.

427
00:30:36,733 --> 00:30:38,053
Do I dislike him?

428
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:42,133
It's obvious to everybody.
Especially to him.

429
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:47,693
What's he ever done to you?

430
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:48,893
What?

431
00:30:49,093 --> 00:30:51,253
Why do you hate him so much?

432
00:30:51,613 --> 00:30:52,973
What's he ever done to you?

433
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:57,452
Nothing.

434
00:30:58,972 --> 00:31:01,412
What was Dr. Baugh doing up here?

435
00:31:02,772 --> 00:31:04,412
What did he...

436
00:31:08,892 --> 00:31:11,092
That's right. Big Daddy is going to die.

437
00:31:14,212 --> 00:31:16,412
I don't believe that.

438
00:31:16,852 --> 00:31:19,692
Dr. Baugh wouldn't lie to Big Daddy.

439
00:31:19,892 --> 00:31:21,172
Wouldn't he, Maggie?

440
00:31:25,812 --> 00:31:27,772
Poor Big Daddy.

441
00:31:28,892 --> 00:31:30,732
I'm fond of him.

442
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:33,532
I'm genuinely fond of that old man.

443
00:31:33,812 --> 00:31:35,692
I really am, you know.

444
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:39,172
When he finds out...

445
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:42,491
I wouldn't want to be the one to tell him.

446
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:46,251
That's why you want to go now.

447
00:31:47,811 --> 00:31:50,291
Yeah, that's why I want to leave now.

448
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:55,011
You've got to do this for me, Maggie.

449
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:57,531
And leave the field to Gooper and his wife?

450
00:31:57,691 --> 00:31:58,651
No, sir!

451
00:31:58,851 --> 00:32:00,371
Let's face facts, baby.

452
00:32:00,571 --> 00:32:02,251
You're a drinker. That takes money.

453
00:32:02,451 --> 00:32:03,731
I don't want his money!

454
00:32:03,931 --> 00:32:05,851
Are you ready to settle for ten-cent beer?

455
00:32:05,931 --> 00:32:08,971
That's what Gooper'll dole out to you
when they freeze you out.

456
00:32:09,171 --> 00:32:11,331
They've got a plan, baby.

457
00:32:11,531 --> 00:32:15,851
You should've heard them
laying it on to Big Daddy. A mile a minute!

458
00:32:16,051 --> 00:32:18,491
Big Mama's already on their side.

459
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,971
You're a drinker and I'm childless.

460
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:26,091
We've got to beat that plan,
we've just got to!

461
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,490
I've been so...

462
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:33,690
...disgustingly poor all my life.

463
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,490
That's the truth, Brick.

464
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,450
Have you, Maggie?

465
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,290
You don't know what it's like to have to...

466
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,650
...suck up to people you can't stand,
just because they have money.

467
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,770
You don't know what it's like...

468
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,010
...never having any clothes.

469
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,050
That dress I married you in...

470
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:59,170
...was a hand-me-down
from a snotty, rich cousin I hated.

471
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:03,450
You can be young without money.

472
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,810
But you can't be old without it.

473
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,329
Where did I fail you?

474
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,129
Where did I make my mistake?

475
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:17,849
Make that your last drink
until after the party...

476
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,369
...please, honey.

477
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:29,049
I think I made my mistake
when I tried to tell you about Skipper.

478
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:31,169
That's my fatal error.

479
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:33,489
- I never should...
- Shut up about Skipper!

480
00:33:33,689 --> 00:33:35,489
I mean it! Shut up!

481
00:33:35,689 --> 00:33:38,249
The laws of silence won't work about that!

482
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,289
Not about Skipper and us.

483
00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:44,209
It's like locking the door on a fire
to forget the house is burning.

484
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:45,849
Hey, everybody!

485
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:49,969
But not looking at a fire doesn't put it out.

486
00:33:50,209 --> 00:33:54,849
This time I'm going to finish.
That night in the hotel room, Skipper...

487
00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:56,448
I don't want to hear about it!

488
00:33:56,688 --> 00:33:59,288
Why won't you face the truth, just once...

489
00:33:59,448 --> 00:34:02,488
...about Skipper, about me, about yourself?

490
00:34:03,688 --> 00:34:05,688
Are you bringing that party up here or not?

491
00:34:05,848 --> 00:34:07,248
Kit and caboodle, son.

492
00:34:07,448 --> 00:34:10,208
That won't do any good.
I'm going to say this...

493
00:34:10,408 --> 00:34:13,208
...and I don't care if it's in front of them.

494
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:16,768
Do you want to be hit with this crutch?

495
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:18,848
Are you still blaming me
for Skipper's death?

496
00:34:18,928 --> 00:34:20,528
I could kill you with this crutch.

497
00:34:20,728 --> 00:34:22,888
Good Lord! Do you think I'd care?

498
00:34:23,088 --> 00:34:25,928
Skipper and I had a friendship.
Why won't you let it alone?

499
00:34:26,008 --> 00:34:28,248
- It's got to be told!
- I don't want to hear it!

500
00:34:28,448 --> 00:34:31,688
It's got to be told
and you never let me tell it. I love you...

501
00:34:31,888 --> 00:34:34,528
...and that's worth fighting for.
Not Skipper!

502
00:34:34,728 --> 00:34:36,248
Skipper was no good!

503
00:34:36,448 --> 00:34:37,808
Maybe I'm no good.

504
00:34:38,008 --> 00:34:39,168
Nobody's good.

505
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,647
But Skipper is dead!

506
00:34:42,007 --> 00:34:43,767
And I'm alive!

507
00:34:43,927 --> 00:34:45,807
Maggie the cat is alive!

508
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:47,327
I'm alive!

509
00:34:47,527 --> 00:34:49,447
Why are you afraid of the truth?

510
00:34:49,647 --> 00:34:50,647
Truth?

511
00:34:58,087 --> 00:35:01,767
Little girl, somebody ought to teach you...

512
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,647
...to knock before you open a door.

513
00:35:04,847 --> 00:35:09,207
Otherwise, people might think
you're lacking in good breeding.

514
00:35:12,687 --> 00:35:15,567
What's Uncle Brick doing on the floor?

515
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:18,807
I tried to kill your Aunt Maggie...

516
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:23,287
...but I failed...

517
00:35:24,007 --> 00:35:27,846
...and I fell. Little girl,
would you hand me my crutch, please?

518
00:35:32,846 --> 00:35:35,686
What were you jumping high hurdles for?

519
00:35:36,126 --> 00:35:39,846
Because I used to, and people like to do
what they used to do...

520
00:35:40,526 --> 00:35:43,126
...after they've stopped being able to do it.

521
00:35:43,286 --> 00:35:46,566
That's right. And that's your answer.

522
00:35:46,846 --> 00:35:47,966
Now go away.

523
00:35:49,326 --> 00:35:52,446
Stop that, you little no-neck monster!

524
00:35:52,646 --> 00:35:56,886
You're just jealous
because you can't have babies.

525
00:36:05,686 --> 00:36:06,886
You see?

526
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:12,165
Mae and Gooper gloat over us
being childless...

527
00:36:13,445 --> 00:36:16,765
...even in front of their little
no-neck monsters.

528
00:36:22,165 --> 00:36:24,685
I went to a doctor in Memphis.

529
00:36:25,045 --> 00:36:27,125
A gynecologist.

530
00:36:28,245 --> 00:36:31,805
He says there's no reason
why we can't have a child...

531
00:36:32,005 --> 00:36:33,925
...whenever we want.

532
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:44,085
- Are you listening?
- Yes, Maggie, I hear you.

533
00:36:45,485 --> 00:36:48,725
But how in hell do you imagine
you're going to have a child...

534
00:36:48,885 --> 00:36:51,405
...by a man who cannot stand you?

535
00:36:59,164 --> 00:37:01,204
That, boy of mine...

536
00:37:02,444 --> 00:37:05,764
...is a problem I'll just have to work out.

537
00:37:05,964 --> 00:37:08,364
Here comes that party, here we come!

538
00:37:08,564 --> 00:37:11,364
Here comes that birthday party!

539
00:37:11,644 --> 00:37:13,204
That's nice.

540
00:37:15,044 --> 00:37:19,244
The preacher almost cried when I told him
I got a stained-glass memorial window.

541
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:21,244
Who gave you that window, Deacon?

542
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,164
Clyde Fletcher's widow,
a generous woman of fine character.

543
00:37:24,364 --> 00:37:27,004
What someone should give our church
is a cooling system.

544
00:37:27,084 --> 00:37:28,484
Yes, sir. Exactly my thought.

545
00:37:28,564 --> 00:37:31,964
Let's see, they've had the typhoid shots
and the tetanus shots...

546
00:37:32,164 --> 00:37:36,604
...diphtheria shots, hepatitis shots,
polio shots.

547
00:37:38,564 --> 00:37:41,084
Gooper, what have all the kiddies
been shot for?

548
00:37:41,284 --> 00:37:43,363
Everything but stealing chickens.

549
00:37:50,683 --> 00:37:51,683
Well, Brick?

550
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:54,563
Congratulations, Big Daddy,
on your birthday.

551
00:37:54,763 --> 00:37:57,443
- Bull!
- Guess what memorial Gus's family gave?

552
00:37:57,643 --> 00:38:01,123
- A new house and basketball court...
- Deacon!

553
00:38:02,003 --> 00:38:05,123
What's all this talk about
memorial stained-glass windows?

554
00:38:05,323 --> 00:38:08,083
Figuring on somebody kicking off
around here?

555
00:38:08,323 --> 00:38:11,923
How about some nice music
to start the party off with?

556
00:38:15,483 --> 00:38:17,643
Turn that damn thing off!

557
00:38:19,603 --> 00:38:21,643
Where's my Brick?

558
00:38:21,723 --> 00:38:24,363
- Where's my precious baby?
- Sorry, turn it back on.

559
00:38:24,683 --> 00:38:26,243
How does your leg feel, honey?

560
00:38:26,322 --> 00:38:29,802
Your hand was made for holding
something better! Put that liquor down.

561
00:38:30,002 --> 00:38:32,522
- He is putting it down, all right!
- Turn that off!

562
00:38:33,042 --> 00:38:35,922
How about a birthday kiss, honey?

563
00:38:40,482 --> 00:38:45,162
Hey, everybody, you know the first time
Big Daddy kissed me, I fainted.

564
00:38:45,362 --> 00:38:47,242
It's a fact. Ain't that so, honey?

565
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:51,842
Do you all know how he proposed to me?
I was four months swole with Gooper...

566
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:55,082
...and Big Daddy said,
"That's my kid, ain't it?"

567
00:38:55,282 --> 00:38:57,522
It was kind of funny.
I'd never had a beau...

568
00:38:57,682 --> 00:39:00,322
...till I met your father.
He said, "I want that kid.

569
00:39:00,522 --> 00:39:01,762
"I need him.

570
00:39:01,962 --> 00:39:06,162
"He ain't going to have nobody else's name
but mine. Let's get the preacher.

571
00:39:06,322 --> 00:39:08,762
"That's what marriage is for. Family."

572
00:39:09,842 --> 00:39:12,561
Children were mighty important
to Big Daddy, even then.

573
00:39:12,721 --> 00:39:14,521
Ida, will you stop that yammering?

574
00:39:15,081 --> 00:39:18,001
That's just his manner of talking.
He don't mean it.

575
00:39:18,201 --> 00:39:20,841
I've been his one and only lover,
haven't I, sweetheart?

576
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:23,121
Ida, will you keep quiet?

577
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,641
Children, come on!

578
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:33,121
Here comes Big Daddy's birthday!

579
00:39:36,361 --> 00:39:38,801
"Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow

580
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,321
"Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow

581
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:45,001
"And so is Big Mama, too

582
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:54,481
"Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow

583
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:58,800
"And so is Big Mama, too"

584
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,960
- Ida, what the hell's the matter with you?
- She's just so happy.

585
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,280
I'm so happy.
I've just got to cry or something.

586
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,080
Big Daddy's 100 percent...

587
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,360
...healthy!

588
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,840
Aren't you going to give Big Daddy
his birthday present?

589
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,560
- You can open up your birthday present.
- You open it. I want to talk to Brick.

590
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,240
Brick, come over here.

591
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,920
Big Daddy's calling you.

592
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,720
Big Mama, take them out for me.

593
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,560
- It's a cashmere robe!
- You sound surprised.

594
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,919
- I've never seen a cashmere robe before.
- That's funny!

595
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:47,159
What's so funny about it?

596
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:49,839
All my family ever had was family.

597
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:51,919
Quiet!

598
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:55,239
- You bought it yourself last Saturday.
- I said quiet!

599
00:40:55,439 --> 00:40:59,519
The salesgirl that sold it to you
waited on me and she told me about it.

600
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,439
- Sister Woman!
- Quiet!

601
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,999
- Stork and the Grim Reaper, neck and neck.
- Deacon!

602
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,119
Deacon!

603
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,439
I'm not butting in on more talk about
memorial stained-glass windows, am I?

604
00:41:10,919 --> 00:41:12,399
Not at all.

605
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,039
What do you get out
of this charity work, anyway?

606
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:18,919
I love humanity. That's my reward.

607
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,959
And if humanity returns your love,
you might get elected...

608
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:23,999
...councilman or mayor, hey, Deacon?

609
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,879
Don't start picking on Deacon.

610
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,358
- That's all right. I was...
- Good night, Deacon.

611
00:41:28,438 --> 00:41:32,318
That's exactly what I was about to say.
I better go before it starts raining.

612
00:41:32,518 --> 00:41:35,998
Good night, everybody.
Bless each and every one in this place.

613
00:41:37,198 --> 00:41:40,398
They tell me you were indulging in
some athletics last night.

614
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:43,638
- I was trying to, yes, sir.
- At 3:00 in the morning?

615
00:41:44,078 --> 00:41:47,838
What were you doing on the high school
athletic field at 3:00 in the morning?

616
00:41:47,918 --> 00:41:52,718
I was running and jumping the hurdles.
They've got too high for me now.

617
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:54,558
Because you were drunk!

618
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,638
Sober, I would not have tried
to jump even the low ones.

619
00:41:57,998 --> 00:42:00,158
It's time to blow out the candles!

620
00:42:00,558 --> 00:42:02,998
A toast to Big Daddy Pollitt...

621
00:42:03,198 --> 00:42:05,918
...on his 65th birthday.

622
00:42:06,118 --> 00:42:09,958
- To the biggest cotton planter...
- I told you, quit this bull!

623
00:42:10,038 --> 00:42:12,877
I won't let you talk this way,
not even on your birthday.

624
00:42:12,957 --> 00:42:16,317
I'll talk like I want to on my birthday,
or any other rotten day.

625
00:42:16,397 --> 00:42:19,197
Anybody don't like it,
they know what they can do about it.

626
00:42:19,277 --> 00:42:22,277
- I know you don't mean that.
- You don't know nothing, never did.

627
00:42:22,357 --> 00:42:25,877
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do mean it.

628
00:42:27,157 --> 00:42:31,077
I've put up with a lot of bull around here
because I thought I was dying.

629
00:42:31,277 --> 00:42:33,597
That's when you started taking over.

630
00:42:33,797 --> 00:42:37,997
Your loud voice and busybody butting in
here and there and everywhere.

631
00:42:38,157 --> 00:42:41,877
Sashaying around here,
making a big noise like a boss.

632
00:42:42,077 --> 00:42:44,477
I'm the only boss around here.

633
00:42:44,877 --> 00:42:47,757
I built this place with no help from you.

634
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:50,797
And I'll run this place till the day I die.

635
00:42:50,997 --> 00:42:54,517
Is that plain to you, Ida?
Is that perfectly clear to you?

636
00:42:54,717 --> 00:42:55,877
I ain't going to die.

637
00:42:56,396 --> 00:42:59,436
Ain't nothing wrong with me
but a spastic colon!

638
00:42:59,996 --> 00:43:02,876
Made spastic, I reckon,
by all the lies and liars...

639
00:43:03,076 --> 00:43:05,396
...I've had to put up with around here.

640
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:10,036
And all the hypocrisy I've had to live with
these 40 years I've lived with you.

641
00:43:11,116 --> 00:43:13,036
Now blow out them candles.

642
00:43:13,996 --> 00:43:16,956
Go on. Blow out them candles
on that stupid cake.

643
00:43:21,556 --> 00:43:26,036
In all these years
you never believed I loved you.

644
00:43:28,636 --> 00:43:30,116
And I did.

645
00:43:31,596 --> 00:43:33,356
I did so much.

646
00:43:34,476 --> 00:43:35,956
I did love you.

647
00:43:37,356 --> 00:43:41,236
I even loved your hate and your hardness.

648
00:43:47,275 --> 00:43:50,315
- Big Daddy should make plans.
- Lf he should die before...

649
00:43:51,075 --> 00:43:52,355
Excuse me.

650
00:43:57,435 --> 00:43:58,675
Son!

651
00:44:02,915 --> 00:44:04,395
I was calling Brick.

652
00:44:05,515 --> 00:44:07,955
I was just delivering him to you.

653
00:44:19,555 --> 00:44:22,195
- What did you do that for?
- Do what?

654
00:44:23,595 --> 00:44:25,035
Wipe off her kiss?

655
00:44:28,354 --> 00:44:29,474
Did I?

656
00:44:29,674 --> 00:44:31,794
Your woman's got a better shape on her...

657
00:44:31,994 --> 00:44:33,514
...than Gooper's got on his.

658
00:44:34,034 --> 00:44:38,234
- Is that the only difference you've noticed?
- Difference in shape is pretty important.

659
00:44:38,434 --> 00:44:41,114
- But in a way, they're a lot alike.
- How's that?

660
00:44:41,314 --> 00:44:44,194
They don't look peaceful. How's that?

661
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:46,434
They're a couple of cats...

662
00:44:46,674 --> 00:44:50,754
...sitting in the middle of 28,000 acres
of land. That's a lot of land.

663
00:44:51,114 --> 00:44:55,394
They're both squaring off, determined
to get a bigger piece whenever you let go.

664
00:44:56,274 --> 00:44:58,994
Yeah, well, I've got a surprise
for them babies.

665
00:44:59,194 --> 00:45:02,514
I ain't letting go for a long time yet,
if they're waiting for that.

666
00:45:02,594 --> 00:45:06,274
You just sit tight and let them
scratch each other's eyes out.

667
00:45:06,474 --> 00:45:07,834
You bet your life.

668
00:45:08,394 --> 00:45:12,033
Gooper's wife, she's a good breeder.
You'll have to admit she's fertile.

669
00:45:12,233 --> 00:45:14,633
Five head of them already
and more coming.

670
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:19,193
6-0. She'll probably drop a litter next time.

671
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:24,153
- Are you stuck out there?
- I was just passing by.

672
00:45:24,233 --> 00:45:26,073
You were just sneaking and spying.

673
00:45:26,273 --> 00:45:29,913
Do I have to lock all the doors around here
to have a private conversation?

674
00:45:30,113 --> 00:45:32,993
- Why hurt those that really love you?
- Bull!

675
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:35,593
I'm going to move you and Gooper
out of that room.

676
00:45:35,753 --> 00:45:39,193
It's none of your business what goes on
in here between Brick and Maggie.

677
00:45:39,393 --> 00:45:41,953
I hate sneaking and spying!
It makes me puke!

678
00:45:46,873 --> 00:45:48,153
They listen, do they?

679
00:45:48,393 --> 00:45:50,153
Yeah, they listen.

680
00:45:50,353 --> 00:45:53,033
They run and tell Big Mama
everything they hear.

681
00:45:53,273 --> 00:45:56,832
They say Maggie sleeps on the bed
and you sleep on the sofa. Is that true?

682
00:45:57,832 --> 00:45:59,912
If you don't like Maggie, get rid of her!

683
00:46:00,272 --> 00:46:02,712
- What are you doing now?
- Freshening up my drink.

684
00:46:02,912 --> 00:46:05,432
- You know you've a real liquor problem?
- Yes, sir.

685
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:09,312
- Is that why you quit sports announcing?
- I guess so. Yes, sir, that's it.

686
00:46:09,512 --> 00:46:10,392
Don't guess!

687
00:46:10,592 --> 00:46:12,472
It's too important!

688
00:46:12,992 --> 00:46:14,592
So you quit.

689
00:46:15,432 --> 00:46:18,112
- Some kind of a disappointment?
- I don't know. Do you?

690
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,872
I'm asking you.
How should I know if you don't?

691
00:46:25,192 --> 00:46:28,592
Do you think a shot of that whisky
would injure my spastic condition?

692
00:46:30,752 --> 00:46:31,992
No, sir.

693
00:46:33,152 --> 00:46:34,992
It might do it some good.

694
00:46:42,151 --> 00:46:44,231
The sky is open again, boy. It's open!

695
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:46,191
That's the way to feel.

696
00:46:51,271 --> 00:46:52,991
I can breathe.

697
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,991
All my life I've been like a doubled-up fist...

698
00:46:57,191 --> 00:46:59,911
...pounding and smashing and driving!

699
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:03,231
But now I'm going
to take things easy with them.

700
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,431
Do you know what I'm thinking?

701
00:47:06,511 --> 00:47:07,951
What's that, sir?

702
00:47:08,231 --> 00:47:09,351
Pleasure!

703
00:47:11,511 --> 00:47:14,991
I'll tell you, I still have a feeling for women,
and I'm 65.

704
00:47:15,191 --> 00:47:17,551
- That's mighty remarkable.
- Remarkable?

705
00:47:18,151 --> 00:47:19,111
Admirable.

706
00:47:19,311 --> 00:47:23,511
It's not only remarkable and admirable,
it's downright satisfying.

707
00:47:23,711 --> 00:47:26,630
- I'm going to have me a ball.
- A ball?

708
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:28,550
I'm going to pick me a choice woman...

709
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:32,350
...and I'm going to smother her in minks
and choke her with diamonds.

710
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,270
I'm going to be happy!

711
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:39,350
Why are you so restless?
You got ants in your britches?

712
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:40,910
- Yes, sir.
- Why?

713
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:45,030
- Something hasn't happened yet.
- What's that?

714
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,630
- A click in my head.
- Did you say, "click"?

715
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:51,510
Yes, sir. That click in my head
that makes me feel peaceful.

716
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:53,790
Boy, sometimes you worry me.

717
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:59,670
Like a switch clicking off in my head.
Turns the hot light off and the cool one on.

718
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,550
All of a sudden, there's peace.

719
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,070
You're a real alcoholic!

720
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:08,710
That is the truth.

721
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:13,109
Yes, sir, I am an alcoholic.
So, if you'll just excuse me.

722
00:48:13,429 --> 00:48:15,429
- No, I won't!
- I'm waiting for that click...

723
00:48:15,509 --> 00:48:19,269
...and I don't get it unless I'm alone!
I'm not talking. When it's quiet!

724
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:23,789
You'll hear plenty of that in the grave.
Right now we're going to talk.

725
00:48:23,989 --> 00:48:27,309
This talk is like all the others.
It gets nowhere and it's painful!

726
00:48:28,269 --> 00:48:32,589
- Let it be painful.
- I can crawl and hop if I have to.

727
00:48:33,509 --> 00:48:38,589
If you aren't careful, you'll crawl out
this family and be drinking on skid row.

728
00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:40,269
Yeah, that will come too.

729
00:48:40,829 --> 00:48:44,669
No. Now that I'm straightened out,
I'm going to straighten you out.

730
00:48:44,749 --> 00:48:46,109
Sit down!

731
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:50,069
It's no use. We talk in circles.
We have nothing to say to each other!

732
00:48:56,988 --> 00:48:59,388
- Where are you going?
- To get another bottle.

733
00:48:59,588 --> 00:49:01,908
No, you're not, you drunken whelp!

734
00:49:03,668 --> 00:49:07,428
- Why are you shouting? I can't stand it!
- Get out of here!

735
00:49:07,628 --> 00:49:10,148
Leave us alone! Why do you drink?

736
00:49:12,188 --> 00:49:14,388
You had better know why you drink
or give it up!

737
00:49:14,988 --> 00:49:16,228
Give me my crutch.

738
00:49:16,428 --> 00:49:17,228
Why do you drink?

739
00:49:17,308 --> 00:49:19,348
I stepped on that foot and now I'm in pain.

740
00:49:19,548 --> 00:49:20,788
Good!

741
00:49:27,268 --> 00:49:28,628
At least you're not too numb...

742
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:31,308
...with liquor to feel pain.

743
00:49:33,748 --> 00:49:35,748
- Why do you drink?
- Give me my crutch.

744
00:49:35,948 --> 00:49:39,588
- Tell me first.
- No, give me a drink first.

745
00:49:41,507 --> 00:49:44,347
- First you've got to tell me!
- All right! Disgust!

746
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:47,547
- Disgust with what?
- You strike a hard bargain.

747
00:49:47,747 --> 00:49:52,187
- Boy, do you want liquor that bad?
- Yes, sir, I want liquor that bad.

748
00:49:56,107 --> 00:49:58,227
What are you disgusted with?

749
00:49:58,987 --> 00:50:02,147
Mendacity! Do you know what that is?
It's lies and liars!

750
00:50:02,307 --> 00:50:04,507
Who's been lying to you? Maggie?

751
00:50:04,707 --> 00:50:06,947
No, not one lie or one person.
The whole thing.

752
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:08,907
- You got a headache?
- No, I'm trying...

753
00:50:09,107 --> 00:50:12,827
Trying to concentrate, but you can't
because your brain is soaked with liquor.

754
00:50:13,027 --> 00:50:14,107
Wet brain!

755
00:50:15,307 --> 00:50:16,427
Mendacity!

756
00:50:16,627 --> 00:50:20,387
What do you know about mendacity?
I could write a book on it.

757
00:50:20,587 --> 00:50:23,827
- It's your sister calling from Memphis.
- To hell with her!

758
00:50:24,387 --> 00:50:25,467
Get out of there!

759
00:50:25,827 --> 00:50:28,466
Go on. Close the door after you.

760
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:29,506
Mendacity!

761
00:50:29,906 --> 00:50:34,586
Look at the lies I've got to put up with.
Pretenses, hypocrisy!

762
00:50:34,786 --> 00:50:39,066
Pretending like I care for Big Mama.
I haven't tolerated her in 40 years.

763
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:43,346
Church! It bores me, but I go.

764
00:50:43,626 --> 00:50:47,906
All those swindling lodges, social clubs,
and money-grabbing auxiliaries...

765
00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:50,466
...that's got me on their number one
sucker list.

766
00:50:50,626 --> 00:50:54,666
Boy, I've lived with mendacity.
Why can't you live with it?

767
00:50:54,866 --> 00:50:59,546
You've got to. There's nothing to live with
but mendacity. Is there?

768
00:51:00,546 --> 00:51:02,626
Yes, sir, you can live with this.

769
00:51:05,506 --> 00:51:06,506
That's not living.

770
00:51:07,946 --> 00:51:10,946
- That's dodging away from life.
- I want to dodge away from it.

771
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,545
Then why not kill yourself?

772
00:51:12,705 --> 00:51:13,985
Because I like to drink.

773
00:51:14,185 --> 00:51:15,905
I can't talk to you!

774
00:51:16,105 --> 00:51:16,865
I'm sorry.

775
00:51:17,065 --> 00:51:20,105
Do you expect me to turn over
28,000 acres of the richest land...

776
00:51:20,305 --> 00:51:22,305
...this side of the Nile to a drunk fool?

777
00:51:22,505 --> 00:51:23,105
No, sir.

778
00:51:23,265 --> 00:51:27,065
I like you, son, but why should I subsidize
worthless behavior?

779
00:51:27,265 --> 00:51:28,425
Give it to Gooper and Mae.

780
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:32,345
I can't stand Gooper and Mae
and those five screaming monkeys.

781
00:51:33,665 --> 00:51:36,305
I don't have to turn it over to any of you!

782
00:51:36,505 --> 00:51:40,625
To this day, I ain't made no will.
Now I don't have to, the pressure's off.

783
00:51:40,825 --> 00:51:43,665
I can wait and see
if you pull yourself together or not.

784
00:51:43,745 --> 00:51:44,545
That's right.

785
00:51:45,065 --> 00:51:48,065
- I'm not kidding.
- No, sir, I know you're not kidding.

786
00:51:48,865 --> 00:51:49,905
You don't care?

787
00:51:50,105 --> 00:51:52,065
No, sir, I don't care.

788
00:51:53,265 --> 00:51:54,865
Tell Lacey to drive me to the station.

789
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,824
- Now wait a minute!
- Or I'll drive myself.

790
00:51:57,024 --> 00:51:58,904
I'm going home tonight. Now!

791
00:51:59,104 --> 00:52:01,824
- This is your home.
- Is it? Since when?

792
00:52:03,104 --> 00:52:05,024
Let's not leave it like this.

793
00:52:05,264 --> 00:52:07,744
Like all them other talks we've had.

794
00:52:07,944 --> 00:52:11,224
We always seem to talk around things.

795
00:52:11,584 --> 00:52:15,184
Seem to leave things unsaid and unspoken.

796
00:52:15,464 --> 00:52:18,864
- Now we've got to talk straight.
- It's too late for talk.

797
00:52:19,064 --> 00:52:20,144
Why?

798
00:52:20,344 --> 00:52:22,144
What are you disgusted about?

799
00:52:22,584 --> 00:52:25,304
Because you can't play football anymore?

800
00:52:25,664 --> 00:52:28,864
Because you lost your job?
I'll get it back for you!

801
00:52:34,624 --> 00:52:38,144
What? Sit in a glass box
watching games that I can't play?

802
00:52:38,344 --> 00:52:41,663
Describing what I can't do
while others do it?

803
00:52:42,823 --> 00:52:47,383
Filling my Coke with bourbon so I can
stand it? You'll get that back for me?

804
00:52:47,783 --> 00:52:49,863
I think you're passing the buck.

805
00:52:52,663 --> 00:52:53,983
Do you know many drinking men?

806
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,663
I've known a good number.

807
00:52:55,863 --> 00:52:57,943
Could any of them they tell you
why they drank?

808
00:52:58,023 --> 00:52:59,663
You're passing the buck?

809
00:52:59,863 --> 00:53:03,543
You're passing the buck
to things like disgust and mendacity.

810
00:53:03,743 --> 00:53:05,823
If you've got to use that kind of language...

811
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:09,023
...it's 90 proof bull and I ain't buying any!

812
00:53:09,183 --> 00:53:14,143
You started drinking with your friend
Skipper's death. Ain't that the truth?

813
00:53:22,863 --> 00:53:24,143
What are you suggesting?

814
00:53:25,183 --> 00:53:26,143
Nothing. But...

815
00:53:26,343 --> 00:53:27,582
But what?

816
00:53:27,742 --> 00:53:28,742
Say your mind.

817
00:53:29,102 --> 00:53:30,142
Say it!

818
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:33,062
- Why are you so excited?
- Go ahead, say it!

819
00:53:33,262 --> 00:53:34,662
Why are you shouting like that?

820
00:53:34,742 --> 00:53:36,702
Skipper and I were friends, understand?

821
00:53:36,862 --> 00:53:38,302
Gooper said that Skipper was...

822
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:41,222
Skipper is the only thing
that I've got left to believe in!

823
00:53:41,302 --> 00:53:42,902
And you drag it through the gutter!

824
00:53:42,982 --> 00:53:45,502
- Just a minute!
- You make it shameful and filthy!

825
00:53:55,062 --> 00:53:56,302
Give me your hand.

826
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:02,182
I don't want your hand.
To hell with all lies and liars!

827
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:05,342
Didn't you ever look up to anybody?

828
00:54:05,502 --> 00:54:07,222
Anybody at all in your whole life?

829
00:54:07,422 --> 00:54:10,142
Didn't you ever believe in anything,
anybody?

830
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:14,181
No, sir, I guess you didn't.

831
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,621
Nothing and nobody
except Big Daddy himself.

832
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:19,821
You and Skipper played football together.

833
00:54:19,901 --> 00:54:22,461
Made a few touchdowns.
Does that make him God Almighty?

834
00:54:22,661 --> 00:54:23,901
I could depend on him.

835
00:54:24,021 --> 00:54:26,941
- On the football field!
- Anytime, anywhere, anyplace!

836
00:54:27,141 --> 00:54:28,661
- Are you sure of that?
- Yes.

837
00:54:28,861 --> 00:54:30,221
Bull!

838
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:33,741
Why did your big strong man fall apart?

839
00:54:34,301 --> 00:54:35,901
Why did Skipper crack up?

840
00:54:37,461 --> 00:54:38,701
All right.

841
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:42,381
You're asking for it,
we're going to have that talk.

842
00:54:43,421 --> 00:54:45,741
That straight, true talk.

843
00:54:45,981 --> 00:54:47,421
It's too late to stop now.

844
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:49,061
Can you say it without a drink?

845
00:54:49,141 --> 00:54:51,701
I haven't heard that mechanical click yet.

846
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:55,901
You need a lot of crutches, don't you?
Clicks. Whisky.

847
00:54:56,101 --> 00:54:57,900
What else do you need?

848
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:58,660
Skipper?

849
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:02,620
- He was a crutch for you too, wasn't he?
- Yes, sir.

850
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,300
I could lean on him, in school and out of it.

851
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:09,660
How did Maggie take
this great and true friendship?

852
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,220
Ask her.

853
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,340
I'm asking you.

854
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:17,900
If you want to know why Skipper
cracked up, ask Maggie the cat.

855
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:18,860
What did she do?

856
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,780
Chase him out of the window
of that Chicago hotel?

857
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:26,420
Did that little bitty girl shove
your big hero out all by herself?

858
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,100
Why?

859
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,260
What went on
between Skipper and Maggie?

860
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,540
Ask her.

861
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,780
Maggie, come here.

862
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:42,659
Can I be of assistance, Big Daddy?

863
00:55:46,099 --> 00:55:48,539
Trixie's ready to play the piano for you!

864
00:55:48,739 --> 00:55:50,899
Go ahead, play.

865
00:55:58,579 --> 00:56:01,499
What was going on
between you and Skipper?

866
00:56:03,419 --> 00:56:05,339
Well, you see, Big Daddy...

867
00:56:07,259 --> 00:56:08,419
Well?

868
00:56:09,619 --> 00:56:11,419
Come on, Maggie!

869
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:13,659
You wanted to talk truth upstairs.

870
00:56:13,819 --> 00:56:15,259
Go ahead!

871
00:56:15,419 --> 00:56:17,979
Big Daddy wants to know. Tell him!

872
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:24,779
Skipper didn't like me.

873
00:56:24,979 --> 00:56:26,938
Why didn't Skipper like you?

874
00:56:27,138 --> 00:56:29,698
- You know he was against our marriage.
- Why?

875
00:56:29,898 --> 00:56:33,498
- Because it meant less freedom for you.
- Freedom to do what?

876
00:56:33,658 --> 00:56:36,098
Freedom to run from town to town.

877
00:56:36,298 --> 00:56:38,458
Planes, trains, always running!

878
00:56:38,618 --> 00:56:42,738
- Football practice, dirty stories...
- Nobody forced you to come along with us!

879
00:56:42,938 --> 00:56:46,858
I didn't expect to spend my honeymoon
in the locker room with the boys.

880
00:56:47,058 --> 00:56:50,338
Since when did a man's smell
ever injure your sensitive feelings?

881
00:56:50,538 --> 00:56:51,978
Football, baby!

882
00:56:52,178 --> 00:56:54,458
The idea of football smelled.

883
00:56:54,618 --> 00:56:57,458
Especially the notions
of a professional team.

884
00:56:57,658 --> 00:56:59,818
He didn't need any team of his own.

885
00:57:00,018 --> 00:57:03,378
He could've gotten a spot
on any pro team in the country.

886
00:57:04,378 --> 00:57:06,778
You organized your own team
on account of Skipper.

887
00:57:06,978 --> 00:57:10,338
- You're a liar!
- He wasn't good enough on his own.

888
00:57:10,538 --> 00:57:12,777
Professional football is a business...

889
00:57:12,977 --> 00:57:13,977
...not a social club!

890
00:57:14,657 --> 00:57:16,617
You mean the business of making money?

891
00:57:16,817 --> 00:57:19,297
Yeah, money!
The stuff your dreams are made of!

892
00:57:19,777 --> 00:57:22,457
The Dixie Stars never made a nickel!

893
00:57:22,617 --> 00:57:24,937
Not from the first day to the last.

894
00:57:25,137 --> 00:57:27,177
It wasn't the money, it was the cheers.

895
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:28,777
He lapped them up.

896
00:57:28,977 --> 00:57:32,457
The cheers didn't mean anything to me.
But they did to you!

897
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:35,377
Because they shut you out
and you hated that.

898
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,777
Not by the crowds, baby, by you.

899
00:57:37,977 --> 00:57:39,697
By the man I worshiped.

900
00:57:39,897 --> 00:57:42,177
That's why I hated Skipper.

901
00:57:42,897 --> 00:57:46,417
You hated him so much you got him drunk
and went to bed with him.

902
00:57:56,856 --> 00:57:58,616
Is that true?

903
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:09,736
You don't think I ravished a football hero?

904
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:14,456
Skipper was drunk.

905
00:58:14,896 --> 00:58:16,816
So are you most of the time.

906
00:58:17,016 --> 00:58:19,656
I don't seem to make out so well with you.

907
00:58:23,656 --> 00:58:26,736
Are you saying nothing happened
between you and Skipper?

908
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:29,416
- You know what happened.
- I don't know!

909
00:58:29,616 --> 00:58:31,376
I wasn't there.

910
00:58:31,576 --> 00:58:34,336
I couldn't play that Sunday.
I wasn't in Chicago.

911
00:58:34,536 --> 00:58:36,496
- I was in the hospital...
- Skipper played.

912
00:58:36,576 --> 00:58:37,936
He played all right!

913
00:58:38,136 --> 00:58:40,256
His first professional game without Brick.

914
00:58:42,215 --> 00:58:44,295
Tell Big Daddy what happened.

915
00:58:44,495 --> 00:58:45,935
Go on, tell him.

916
00:58:46,135 --> 00:58:47,975
You're a sports announcer.

917
00:58:48,175 --> 00:58:52,335
Give us a running account
of the all-American bust.

918
00:58:52,535 --> 00:58:55,335
Tell him how many times
Skipper fumbled...

919
00:58:55,535 --> 00:58:57,975
...and stumbled and fell apart.

920
00:58:58,295 --> 00:59:02,175
On offensive he was useless.
On defensive he was a coward.

921
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:03,735
And it was all over:

922
00:59:03,895 --> 00:59:06,815
Chicago: 47, Dixie Stars: 0.

923
00:59:07,015 --> 00:59:08,575
Bad breaks. An off day.

924
00:59:08,775 --> 00:59:09,735
No, baby.

925
00:59:10,135 --> 00:59:12,855
Without you, Skipper was nothing.

926
00:59:13,015 --> 00:59:15,095
Outside: Big, tough, confident.

927
00:59:15,255 --> 00:59:17,095
Inside: Pure jelly!

928
00:59:18,135 --> 00:59:20,495
You saw the game on TV.
You saw what happened.

929
00:59:20,695 --> 00:59:23,295
But I didn't see what happened
in Skipper's hotel room.

930
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:25,215
That little episode was not on TV.

931
00:59:25,415 --> 00:59:28,494
Tell Big Daddy
why you were in Skipper's room.

932
00:59:28,694 --> 00:59:30,014
He was sick.

933
00:59:30,414 --> 00:59:31,814
Sick with drink.

934
00:59:32,014 --> 00:59:33,254
He wouldn't come out.

935
00:59:33,334 --> 00:59:34,654
He'd busted some furniture...

936
00:59:34,734 --> 00:59:38,374
...and the hotel manager said to stop him
before he called the police.

937
00:59:38,614 --> 00:59:40,814
So I went to his room.

938
00:59:41,094 --> 00:59:43,694
I scratched on his door
and begged him to let me in.

939
00:59:43,894 --> 00:59:45,214
He was half crazy.

940
00:59:45,414 --> 00:59:47,014
Violent and screaming one minute...

941
00:59:47,214 --> 00:59:49,414
...weak and crying the next.

942
00:59:49,614 --> 00:59:52,974
And all the time, scared stiff about you.

943
00:59:53,814 --> 00:59:57,494
So I said to him maybe it was time
we forgot about football.

944
00:59:57,974 --> 01:00:01,294
Maybe he ought to get a job
and let me and Brick alone.

945
01:00:02,414 --> 01:00:04,814
I thought he'd hit me.

946
01:00:05,854 --> 01:00:07,694
He walked toward me...

947
01:00:08,094 --> 01:00:11,813
...with a funny sort of smile on his face.

948
01:00:13,253 --> 01:00:15,653
Then he did the strangest thing.

949
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:17,733
He kissed me.

950
01:00:18,373 --> 01:00:20,853
That was the first time
he'd ever touched me.

951
01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:23,333
And then I knew what I was going to do.

952
01:00:23,533 --> 01:00:25,413
I'd get rid of Skipper.

953
01:00:25,613 --> 01:00:29,213
I'd show Brick that their deep,
true friendship was a big lie.

954
01:00:29,893 --> 01:00:31,253
I'd prove it by showing...

955
01:00:31,453 --> 01:00:34,893
...that Skipper would make love
to his best friend's wife.

956
01:00:35,413 --> 01:00:37,133
He didn't need any coaxing.

957
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:39,213
He was more than willing.

958
01:00:39,413 --> 01:00:41,653
He even seemed to have the same idea.

959
01:00:42,653 --> 01:00:44,453
You're just trying to whitewash it.

960
01:00:44,973 --> 01:00:45,813
I'm not!

961
01:00:46,013 --> 01:00:47,733
I was trying to win back my husband.

962
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:50,813
It didn't matter how.
I would've done anything.

963
01:00:51,013 --> 01:00:52,933
Even that.

964
01:00:53,973 --> 01:00:55,573
But at the last second...

965
01:00:55,733 --> 01:00:57,412
...I got panicky.

966
01:00:58,492 --> 01:01:01,012
Supposing I lost you instead?

967
01:01:01,812 --> 01:01:04,732
Supposing you'd hate me
instead of Skipper?

968
01:01:05,652 --> 01:01:07,412
So I ran.

969
01:01:08,172 --> 01:01:09,452
Nothing happened!

970
01:01:09,652 --> 01:01:12,452
I've tried to tell him a hundred times
but he won't let me.

971
01:01:13,052 --> 01:01:14,292
Nothing happened!

972
01:01:14,492 --> 01:01:16,612
Hallelujah, St. Maggie.

973
01:01:18,332 --> 01:01:20,692
I wanted to get rid of Skipper.

974
01:01:21,532 --> 01:01:23,212
But not if it meant losing you.

975
01:01:23,412 --> 01:01:25,652
He blames me for Skipper's death.

976
01:01:26,532 --> 01:01:29,372
Maybe I got rid of Skipper.

977
01:01:31,932 --> 01:01:34,372
Skipper won out anyway.

978
01:01:36,612 --> 01:01:39,052
I didn't get rid of him at all.

979
01:01:46,531 --> 01:01:49,011
Isn't it an awful joke, honey?

980
01:01:49,851 --> 01:01:51,891
I lost you anyway.

981
01:01:54,451 --> 01:01:56,971
- You didn't talk to him again before he...
- No.

982
01:01:57,931 --> 01:01:59,891
- But Brick did.
- How do you know?

983
01:02:00,051 --> 01:02:01,811
- Skipper told me.
- When?

984
01:02:02,011 --> 01:02:04,531
When they put his broken body
in the ambulance.

985
01:02:04,731 --> 01:02:06,651
I rode with him to the hospital.

986
01:02:06,891 --> 01:02:10,891
He kept saying,
"Why did Brick hang up on me?"

987
01:02:12,211 --> 01:02:13,971
Why, Brick?

988
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:30,970
- Where are you going?
- Home.

989
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:36,450
- You can't drive. You're drunk.
- Not yet, Big Daddy.

990
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:38,370
Not yet. Now, give me that bottle.

991
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:44,010
What are you running away from?

992
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:51,410
Why did you hang up on Skipper
when he called you?

993
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:56,050
Answer me!

994
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:59,650
What did he say?
Was it about him and Maggie?

995
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:02,050
- He said they'd made love.
- And you believed him?

996
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,290
Yes.

997
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:05,890
Then why haven't you thrown her out?

998
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:09,090
Something's missing here.
Why did Skipper kill himself?

999
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:11,410
Because somebody let him down.

1000
01:03:18,409 --> 01:03:20,049
I let him down.

1001
01:03:22,049 --> 01:03:23,969
When he called that night...

1002
01:03:26,889 --> 01:03:29,089
...I couldn't make sense out of...

1003
01:03:29,689 --> 01:03:32,209
But there was one thing that was sure.

1004
01:03:34,329 --> 01:03:36,609
Skipper was scared.

1005
01:03:37,089 --> 01:03:38,729
Scared...

1006
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:42,729
...about what happened that day
on the football field.

1007
01:03:42,929 --> 01:03:43,729
That I'd blame him.

1008
01:03:43,929 --> 01:03:47,009
Scared that I'd walk out on him.

1009
01:03:48,569 --> 01:03:51,689
Skipper afraid! I couldn't believe that.

1010
01:03:51,889 --> 01:03:55,209
I mean, inside he was real
deep-down scared...

1011
01:03:55,889 --> 01:03:58,528
...and he broke like a rotten stick.

1012
01:03:59,728 --> 01:04:01,888
He started crying:

1013
01:04:02,848 --> 01:04:04,688
"I need you."

1014
01:04:04,888 --> 01:04:07,248
He kept babbling, "Help me."

1015
01:04:08,608 --> 01:04:10,448
Me help him?

1016
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:14,128
How does one drowning man...

1017
01:04:14,328 --> 01:04:15,888
...help another drowning man?

1018
01:04:16,368 --> 01:04:18,208
So you hung up on him.

1019
01:04:19,888 --> 01:04:21,848
And then that phone...

1020
01:04:22,448 --> 01:04:24,368
...started to ring again.

1021
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:29,488
It rang and it rang
and it wouldn't stop ringing.

1022
01:04:29,888 --> 01:04:34,728
And I lay in that hospital bed,
unable to move or run from that sound.

1023
01:04:34,968 --> 01:04:37,408
It kept ringing louder and louder.

1024
01:04:37,808 --> 01:04:41,328
And the sound of that
was like Skipper screaming for help.

1025
01:04:45,487 --> 01:04:47,727
And I couldn't pick it up.

1026
01:04:49,327 --> 01:04:51,807
So that's when he killed himself?

1027
01:04:56,127 --> 01:04:57,207
Yes.

1028
01:04:58,927 --> 01:05:00,967
Because I let him down.

1029
01:05:05,487 --> 01:05:09,807
So that disgust with mendacity
is really disgust with myself.

1030
01:05:10,007 --> 01:05:14,167
When I hear that click I don't hear
the sound of that phone ringing anymore.

1031
01:05:14,367 --> 01:05:16,367
And I can stop thinking.

1032
01:05:16,567 --> 01:05:18,127
I'm ashamed!

1033
01:05:18,327 --> 01:05:21,567
That's why I'm a drunk.
When I'm drunk I can stand myself.

1034
01:05:22,007 --> 01:05:24,647
But the truth is always there
in the morning, isn't it?

1035
01:05:25,567 --> 01:05:27,326
And it's here right now.

1036
01:05:28,686 --> 01:05:32,326
You're just feeling sorry for yourself.
That's all it is. Self-pity!

1037
01:05:32,526 --> 01:05:34,766
You didn't kill Skipper. He killed himself.

1038
01:05:34,926 --> 01:05:37,926
You, Skipper and lots like you,
living in a kid's world...

1039
01:05:38,126 --> 01:05:41,846
...playing games, touchdowns,
no worries, no responsibilities.

1040
01:05:42,126 --> 01:05:44,086
Life ain't no damn football game.

1041
01:05:44,286 --> 01:05:46,286
Life ain't just a bunch of high spots.

1042
01:05:47,646 --> 01:05:50,926
You're a 30-year-old kid.
Soon you'll be a 50-year-old kid...

1043
01:05:51,366 --> 01:05:53,766
...pretending you hear cheers
when there ain't any.

1044
01:05:53,846 --> 01:05:56,046
Dreaming and drinking your life away.

1045
01:05:56,246 --> 01:05:57,566
Heroes in the real world...

1046
01:05:57,766 --> 01:06:01,126
...live 24 hours a day,
not just two hours in a game.

1047
01:06:01,766 --> 01:06:04,966
Mendacity! You won't...

1048
01:06:07,326 --> 01:06:10,766
You won't live with mendacity,
but you're an expert at it.

1049
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:12,965
The truth is pain and sweat...

1050
01:06:13,165 --> 01:06:17,245
...paying bills and making love to a woman
that you don't love anymore.

1051
01:06:17,445 --> 01:06:19,445
The truth is dreams that don't come true...

1052
01:06:19,565 --> 01:06:22,445
...and nobody prints your name
in the paper till you die.

1053
01:06:28,205 --> 01:06:29,645
Now, here.

1054
01:06:33,565 --> 01:06:35,485
The truth is you never growed up.

1055
01:06:35,685 --> 01:06:37,765
- Grown-ups don't hang up on friends.
- Get away.

1056
01:06:37,845 --> 01:06:41,005
And they don't hang up on their wives.
They don't hang up on life.

1057
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:43,725
Now that's the truth that you can't face.

1058
01:06:43,925 --> 01:06:45,445
- Can you face the truth?
- Try me.

1059
01:06:45,525 --> 01:06:47,085
Sure, somebody else's truth!

1060
01:06:47,165 --> 01:06:48,925
- You're running again.
- Yeah, I am.

1061
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,525
Running from lies,
like birthday congratulations...

1062
01:06:51,605 --> 01:06:55,045
...and many happy returns of the day
when there won't be any, and...

1063
01:07:06,244 --> 01:07:08,044
Please, let me go home.

1064
01:07:09,324 --> 01:07:11,044
- What did you say?
- I don't remember.

1065
01:07:11,124 --> 01:07:14,244
- There won't be any happy returns?
- Forget it.

1066
01:07:14,444 --> 01:07:16,884
Let me go home.
Leave the place to Gooper and Mae.

1067
01:07:16,964 --> 01:07:20,204
Who said I was going to leave
the place or anything?

1068
01:07:20,404 --> 01:07:21,884
I'll outlive you.

1069
01:07:22,084 --> 01:07:23,124
I'll bury you.

1070
01:07:23,324 --> 01:07:25,284
- I'll buy your coffin.
- That's right.

1071
01:07:25,484 --> 01:07:27,404
Many happy returns.

1072
01:07:33,004 --> 01:07:34,724
They were lying...

1073
01:07:34,924 --> 01:07:36,244
...weren't they, son...

1074
01:07:36,604 --> 01:07:38,764
...about that report from the clinic?

1075
01:07:40,644 --> 01:07:42,123
This pain...

1076
01:07:42,283 --> 01:07:43,963
...that keeps grabbing at me...

1077
01:07:45,083 --> 01:07:46,443
It's death...

1078
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:48,683
...ain't it?

1079
01:07:49,643 --> 01:07:51,083
Answer me!

1080
01:07:51,363 --> 01:07:52,803
The truth!

1081
01:07:53,883 --> 01:07:58,643
You said it yourself.
Mendacity is a system we live in.

1082
01:08:33,482 --> 01:08:34,402
Brick, wait!

1083
01:08:56,362 --> 01:08:58,522
Look at us, Maggie.

1084
01:08:58,722 --> 01:09:01,122
The great Pollitt Enterprises...

1085
01:09:01,722 --> 01:09:03,602
...stuck in the...

1086
01:09:04,722 --> 01:09:06,402
I hurt him, Maggie.

1087
01:09:09,962 --> 01:09:12,761
I hurt him really bad.

1088
01:09:12,961 --> 01:09:14,601
What's the matter? What's happened?

1089
01:09:14,801 --> 01:09:17,601
- Why is Big Daddy...
- We've got to talk to you.

1090
01:09:17,961 --> 01:09:19,521
- Get Dr. Baugh!
- Where is he?

1091
01:09:19,721 --> 01:09:21,761
I don't know, just find him.

1092
01:09:30,801 --> 01:09:31,681
Doc!

1093
01:09:33,321 --> 01:09:35,881
I wouldn't go down to him right now.

1094
01:09:36,121 --> 01:09:37,161
Sweetheart!

1095
01:09:38,441 --> 01:09:40,561
Big Daddy, can you hear me?

1096
01:09:42,081 --> 01:09:43,401
What are you doing?

1097
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:45,281
I'm coming down.

1098
01:09:48,361 --> 01:09:51,121
No need to, Ida.
We'll be coming up in a minute.

1099
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,200
If that pain gets too bad...

1100
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,960
...this is morphine...

1101
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,040
...and a syringe.

1102
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,200
The instructions are written out.

1103
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,280
It's no use pretending anymore.

1104
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,000
When that pain hits, it'll hit hard.

1105
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,120
Make it easy on yourself.

1106
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,800
Here.

1107
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:28,040
You'd better take off those wet clothes.

1108
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:29,720
Why?

1109
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,160
You afraid I might catch cold and die?

1110
01:10:48,279 --> 01:10:49,599
Why can't I go down to him?

1111
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,159
Well, he's...

1112
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,959
His stomach's upset, Ida.

1113
01:10:57,799 --> 01:10:59,599
All he needs is a peppermint.

1114
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:02,919
It's time we had that talk, Doc.

1115
01:11:03,079 --> 01:11:05,879
- It'll be painful.
- Painful things can't always be avoided.

1116
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:08,159
So I've noticed. But there are times...

1117
01:11:08,359 --> 01:11:10,239
It's time we all had our talk.

1118
01:11:10,439 --> 01:11:12,639
What talk are you talking about?

1119
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:16,479
- What were they fighting about?
- We didn't discuss it.

1120
01:11:16,559 --> 01:11:18,599
What's he doing in the cellar all alone?

1121
01:11:18,759 --> 01:11:20,159
Why can't Big Mama see him?

1122
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:21,479
You heard why.

1123
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:24,839
He's got the stomach upset.
It's made him irritable.

1124
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:28,598
When couples have been together
as long as me and Big Daddy...

1125
01:11:28,798 --> 01:11:32,398
...they get irritable with each other
from too much devotion.

1126
01:11:33,518 --> 01:11:35,078
Isn't that so?

1127
01:11:36,318 --> 01:11:38,278
Of course that's so.

1128
01:11:39,078 --> 01:11:40,758
He loves his family.

1129
01:11:40,998 --> 01:11:43,518
He loves them around,
but it strains his nerves.

1130
01:11:43,718 --> 01:11:46,358
He wasn't himself.
I could tell he was all worked-up.

1131
01:11:46,438 --> 01:11:48,998
It's the party and the excitement.

1132
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:51,678
He's probably just a little worn out,
that's all.

1133
01:11:51,878 --> 01:11:53,198
Did you notice how he ate?

1134
01:11:53,278 --> 01:11:55,478
He ate like a P-l-G hog.

1135
01:11:56,038 --> 01:11:57,958
I hope he doesn't regret it.

1136
01:11:58,318 --> 01:11:59,398
Who?

1137
01:11:59,678 --> 01:12:01,158
Big Daddy?

1138
01:12:01,758 --> 01:12:03,718
He helped himself twice to hopping John.

1139
01:12:04,198 --> 01:12:07,518
He just loves hopping John.
We had a real country dinner.

1140
01:12:07,718 --> 01:12:09,158
And candied yams.

1141
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:12,557
That man put away
enough to stuff a field hand.

1142
01:12:13,237 --> 01:12:15,317
I hope he doesn't have
to pay for it later on.

1143
01:12:15,517 --> 01:12:16,637
What's that?

1144
01:12:16,837 --> 01:12:18,077
Gooper say he hopes...

1145
01:12:18,277 --> 01:12:20,477
Shoot! Gooper says!

1146
01:12:20,677 --> 01:12:23,237
There ain't nothing wrong
with Big Daddy but nerves.

1147
01:12:25,477 --> 01:12:26,357
Ain't that so?

1148
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:32,117
He's as sound as a dollar.
And now he knows he is.

1149
01:12:32,317 --> 01:12:36,437
That's why he ate such a supper.
He had a load off his mind, knowing he...

1150
01:12:36,637 --> 01:12:39,197
...he wasn't doomed to...

1151
01:12:39,837 --> 01:12:42,197
...what he thought he was doomed to.

1152
01:12:44,637 --> 01:12:46,597
Nothing's going to hurt Big Daddy.

1153
01:12:46,757 --> 01:12:48,917
We won't allow anything to happen to him.

1154
01:12:49,437 --> 01:12:51,517
Doc, come here!

1155
01:12:51,597 --> 01:12:52,957
I don't need any doctor.

1156
01:12:53,037 --> 01:12:54,837
He's something to say about Big Daddy.

1157
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:56,397
I want Brick.

1158
01:12:57,196 --> 01:12:59,036
He'll be down directly.

1159
01:12:59,236 --> 01:13:01,516
Sticky rain always makes me sick.

1160
01:13:02,516 --> 01:13:05,076
Give me something
to wash this tablet down with.

1161
01:13:05,316 --> 01:13:08,276
What's wrong?
You've all got such long faces.

1162
01:13:11,076 --> 01:13:12,276
Big Mama needs you.

1163
01:13:12,476 --> 01:13:14,036
They'll tell her without me.

1164
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:15,636
Please, Brick.

1165
01:13:15,836 --> 01:13:18,436
I just can't stand the way
that Mae and Gooper are...

1166
01:13:18,596 --> 01:13:21,036
What? Trying to grab this place
for themselves?

1167
01:13:21,236 --> 01:13:23,276
Let them have it all.

1168
01:13:23,476 --> 01:13:25,796
If you want to fight for a piece
of his carcass...

1169
01:13:25,876 --> 01:13:28,116
...you go ahead,
but you'll do it without me.

1170
01:13:28,196 --> 01:13:32,316
I deserved that. But not this time.
This time you're wrong.

1171
01:13:32,516 --> 01:13:33,876
What I can't stand is...

1172
01:13:33,956 --> 01:13:36,996
It's not losing this place, it's Big Mama.

1173
01:13:37,916 --> 01:13:40,636
I know what it's like
to lose somebody you love.

1174
01:13:40,836 --> 01:13:43,435
Careful, your claws are showing.

1175
01:13:46,595 --> 01:13:47,875
Close that door.

1176
01:13:48,075 --> 01:13:49,675
Don't close that door.

1177
01:13:50,595 --> 01:13:52,195
Let a little air circulate.

1178
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:55,795
We shouldn't risk Big Daddy
hearing this discussion.

1179
01:13:56,195 --> 01:13:58,155
What discussion of what?

1180
01:13:58,235 --> 01:13:59,795
- Maggie, Brick!
- Now, now, Big Mama...

1181
01:13:59,875 --> 01:14:02,515
There won't be a word said
in Big Daddy's house...

1182
01:14:02,715 --> 01:14:05,675
...that he can't hear if he wants to.
Brick, where are you?

1183
01:14:05,755 --> 01:14:08,035
Where do you think?
Gone to pieces, that's where!

1184
01:14:08,435 --> 01:14:10,475
Doc, ain't there a cure for drinkers?

1185
01:14:10,675 --> 01:14:12,635
- He don't need no cure.
- Of course not.

1186
01:14:12,835 --> 01:14:15,075
He'll just drink all the whisky in the state.

1187
01:14:15,275 --> 01:14:16,715
Stop that kind of talk!

1188
01:14:17,635 --> 01:14:21,195
Big Daddy takes a drink now and then.
I don't trust a man who don't drink.

1189
01:14:21,395 --> 01:14:22,835
Good for you!

1190
01:14:23,475 --> 01:14:26,075
Sit down and hold Big Mama's hand
while we talk.

1191
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:29,474
What are you all surrounding me for?

1192
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:31,474
I don't need anyone to hold my hand.

1193
01:14:31,674 --> 01:14:32,594
Are you all crazy?

1194
01:14:32,674 --> 01:14:35,914
- You calm yourself, sweetheart.
- You calm yourself, Sister Woman!

1195
01:14:36,114 --> 01:14:37,394
How can I calm myself...

1196
01:14:37,474 --> 01:14:40,354
...with everyone staring at me
as if blood was on my face?

1197
01:14:42,274 --> 01:14:44,114
What's all this about?

1198
01:14:45,194 --> 01:14:46,314
Sit down, Mae.

1199
01:14:46,514 --> 01:14:49,274
Big Mama wants to know the truth
about the clinic report.

1200
01:14:49,474 --> 01:14:50,794
Truth!

1201
01:14:51,674 --> 01:14:54,234
Everybody keeps hollering about the truth.

1202
01:14:54,434 --> 01:14:55,834
The truth is as dirty...

1203
01:14:56,034 --> 01:14:57,114
...as lies!

1204
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:07,474
Is there something I don't know, Doc?

1205
01:15:07,554 --> 01:15:08,514
Well, Ida...

1206
01:15:08,634 --> 01:15:10,114
I want to know!

1207
01:15:13,433 --> 01:15:16,393
- Somebody must be lying.
- Sit down, Mama, please.

1208
01:15:17,033 --> 01:15:18,753
I want to know about my husband.

1209
01:15:18,993 --> 01:15:22,513
He had the most thorough examination
at the Oppenheim Clinic.

1210
01:15:22,713 --> 01:15:24,673
One of the best clinics in the country.

1211
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:27,233
The best in the country, bar none.

1212
01:15:27,393 --> 01:15:29,953
They were 99.9 percent sure
before they even started.

1213
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:31,393
Right, Doc?

1214
01:15:31,713 --> 01:15:32,713
Sure of what?

1215
01:15:32,833 --> 01:15:34,233
- Not now!
- The test was positive!

1216
01:15:34,433 --> 01:15:35,873
Shut up.

1217
01:15:41,473 --> 01:15:44,553
It's hopeless. He knows it, too.

1218
01:15:45,513 --> 01:15:46,513
Hopeless?

1219
01:15:46,713 --> 01:15:49,273
- Now, now, darling.
- You had to know.

1220
01:15:50,433 --> 01:15:53,153
Why didn't they cut it out of him?

1221
01:15:54,433 --> 01:15:57,272
- It's gone past the knife.
- He's dying, Big Mama.

1222
01:15:57,472 --> 01:15:59,752
You get away from me, Mae!

1223
01:15:59,952 --> 01:16:00,752
I want Brick.

1224
01:16:00,832 --> 01:16:02,832
Where's my Brick? Where's my only son?

1225
01:16:06,712 --> 01:16:08,512
Mama, please.

1226
01:16:09,912 --> 01:16:11,992
- I'm your son, too.
- Gooper's your firstborn.

1227
01:16:12,072 --> 01:16:13,912
- Now, listen to me!
- No!

1228
01:16:14,312 --> 01:16:16,192
- He'll be in pain.
- Gooper and I think...

1229
01:16:16,392 --> 01:16:17,752
Shut up!

1230
01:16:17,952 --> 01:16:19,592
Do you want to see him suffer?

1231
01:16:19,712 --> 01:16:22,112
Then he's got to be started on morphine.

1232
01:16:22,272 --> 01:16:24,832
Nobody's going to give
my husband morphine.

1233
01:16:31,912 --> 01:16:34,432
Why don't you give her a while
to adjust to the idea?

1234
01:16:34,512 --> 01:16:36,272
It's Maggie who's upsetting her.

1235
01:16:36,352 --> 01:16:40,352
Instead of the needle, haven't you got a pill
to make the pain disappear?

1236
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:43,951
Sometimes I wish I had a pill
to make people disappear.

1237
01:16:44,151 --> 01:16:46,671
Thanks for everything, Doc.
We sure do appreciate...

1238
01:17:03,231 --> 01:17:04,031
Does Brick know?

1239
01:17:17,631 --> 01:17:19,471
You know, honey...

1240
01:17:21,351 --> 01:17:23,671
...we was never a very happy family.

1241
01:17:26,111 --> 01:17:28,390
There wasn't much joy in this house.

1242
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:31,710
It wasn't Big Daddy's fault. It was just...

1243
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:35,590
You know how some homes are happy.

1244
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:41,150
I thought, coming home from the clinic
today, "Now we'll be happy here."

1245
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:44,910
You and Brick will live with us
and have your children here.

1246
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:47,230
And we'll help each other be happy.

1247
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:54,230
Nothing's ever the way you plan, is it?

1248
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:02,150
Margaret, honey...

1249
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:03,630
...you've got to help Brick.

1250
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:05,310
Make him pull himself together.

1251
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:08,110
- He's going to take hold of things.
- What things?

1252
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:11,550
The place.

1253
01:18:12,029 --> 01:18:13,669
Big Mama, you've had a shock.

1254
01:18:13,869 --> 01:18:15,109
We've all had a shock.

1255
01:18:15,189 --> 01:18:18,029
- Let's be realistic.
- Big Daddy wouldn't be foolish enough...

1256
01:18:18,109 --> 01:18:21,229
He'd never put this place
in irresponsible hands!

1257
01:18:21,309 --> 01:18:23,629
He ain't putting this place
in anybody's hands.

1258
01:18:24,029 --> 01:18:26,309
My husband is not going to die!

1259
01:18:26,509 --> 01:18:28,829
I want you to get that in your heads.
Both of you.

1260
01:18:28,909 --> 01:18:31,269
- We're hoping too.
- We intend to pray for him.

1261
01:18:31,469 --> 01:18:33,469
I won't let you persuade Big Daddy to...

1262
01:18:33,549 --> 01:18:35,469
Gooper is your firstborn!

1263
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:39,229
He's always had to carry a bigger load
of the responsibilities than Brick.

1264
01:18:39,709 --> 01:18:43,349
Brick never carried a thing in his life
but a football or a highball.

1265
01:18:43,549 --> 01:18:44,869
Will you let me talk, please?

1266
01:18:44,949 --> 01:18:46,349
Yes, of course.

1267
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:50,549
A 28,000 acre plantation
is a mighty big thing to run.

1268
01:18:50,749 --> 01:18:52,109
Almost single-handed.

1269
01:18:52,309 --> 01:18:55,709
You had your law practice in Memphis.
When did you run this place?

1270
01:18:55,869 --> 01:18:58,308
Mama, let's be fair.

1271
01:18:58,988 --> 01:19:01,228
Ever since Big Daddy's health
started failing...

1272
01:19:01,308 --> 01:19:03,868
...Gooper's worked like a fool
to keep this place up.

1273
01:19:04,068 --> 01:19:07,508
Gooper won't admit it.
He never thought of it as a duty.

1274
01:19:07,988 --> 01:19:09,708
Big Daddy don't know what he owns.

1275
01:19:09,908 --> 01:19:13,828
The point is I won't see this place ruined
by a drunken ex-football hero.

1276
01:19:14,028 --> 01:19:15,788
Shut up about my husband!

1277
01:19:15,988 --> 01:19:16,788
You shut up!

1278
01:19:16,868 --> 01:19:18,748
He has no right to slander...

1279
01:19:18,948 --> 01:19:21,508
I can discuss my brother
with my family members...

1280
01:19:21,948 --> 01:19:24,148
...which don't include you!

1281
01:19:25,828 --> 01:19:27,468
Why not go up and drink with Brick?

1282
01:19:27,548 --> 01:19:29,988
If the hero hadn't passed out already.

1283
01:19:30,188 --> 01:19:32,588
He may have to pass up
the Sugar Bowl this year.

1284
01:19:32,988 --> 01:19:35,108
Or was it the Rose Bowl
he made his run in?

1285
01:19:35,188 --> 01:19:36,788
It was the punch bowl, honey.

1286
01:19:36,868 --> 01:19:38,828
The cut-glass punch bowl.

1287
01:19:39,348 --> 01:19:41,348
I always get that boy's bowls mixed up.

1288
01:19:41,947 --> 01:19:45,387
I have never seen such malice
toward a brother.

1289
01:19:45,587 --> 01:19:47,707
What about his malice toward Gooper?

1290
01:19:47,907 --> 01:19:50,587
He can't even stand being
in the same room with me.

1291
01:19:52,587 --> 01:19:54,107
Can I help you, Mr. Brick?

1292
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:55,587
No, thank you, Lacey.

1293
01:19:55,787 --> 01:19:58,347
- Where's my father?
- He's in the cellar.

1294
01:19:58,547 --> 01:20:00,347
And he's alone.

1295
01:20:00,707 --> 01:20:01,827
And he's...

1296
01:20:02,507 --> 01:20:04,067
Thank you, Lacey.

1297
01:20:04,547 --> 01:20:07,627
- It's a deliberate campaign to ruin Brick.
- He don't need help.

1298
01:20:07,707 --> 01:20:10,467
For the most disgusting,
sordid reasons on earth.

1299
01:20:10,667 --> 01:20:11,587
Avarice.

1300
01:20:11,787 --> 01:20:14,187
Avarice and greed!

1301
01:20:14,387 --> 01:20:15,267
No, Margaret.

1302
01:20:15,467 --> 01:20:16,787
Don't cry.

1303
01:20:16,987 --> 01:20:19,227
That takes the cake!

1304
01:20:19,427 --> 01:20:21,107
Who are the tears for?

1305
01:20:21,947 --> 01:20:22,667
Brick?

1306
01:20:22,867 --> 01:20:23,907
Big Daddy?

1307
01:20:23,987 --> 01:20:25,067
Or for yourself?

1308
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:27,226
Are you crying 'cause you're childless?

1309
01:20:27,306 --> 01:20:28,866
You know why she's got no kids?

1310
01:20:29,066 --> 01:20:32,266
Ask her big, beautiful husband.

1311
01:20:33,066 --> 01:20:35,666
You just won't let me do this
the nice way, will you?

1312
01:20:37,586 --> 01:20:39,786
You always said I never loved Big Daddy.

1313
01:20:39,986 --> 01:20:41,426
How would you know?

1314
01:20:42,706 --> 01:20:43,946
How would he know?

1315
01:20:44,066 --> 01:20:45,946
Did he ever let anyone love him?

1316
01:20:46,146 --> 01:20:48,626
It was always Brick.
From the day he was born...

1317
01:20:48,706 --> 01:20:51,226
...he was always partial to Brick. Why?

1318
01:20:51,386 --> 01:20:53,946
Big Daddy wanted me to become a lawyer.
I did.

1319
01:20:54,146 --> 01:20:55,466
He said get married. I did.

1320
01:20:55,666 --> 01:20:57,386
He said have kids. I did.

1321
01:20:57,586 --> 01:20:59,546
He said live in Memphis. I did.

1322
01:20:59,746 --> 01:21:02,266
Whatever he said to do, I did.

1323
01:21:03,466 --> 01:21:06,026
I don't give a damn
whether Big Daddy likes me...

1324
01:21:06,226 --> 01:21:07,786
...or did or never did...

1325
01:21:07,986 --> 01:21:10,026
...or will or will never.

1326
01:21:11,306 --> 01:21:14,705
I've appealed for common decency
and fair play.

1327
01:21:14,905 --> 01:21:16,545
Now I'm telling you!

1328
01:21:16,865 --> 01:21:18,745
I intend to protect my interests.

1329
01:21:18,905 --> 01:21:21,465
I'm not a corporation lawyer for nothing.

1330
01:21:22,145 --> 01:21:24,105
Go get my briefcase out of our bedroom.

1331
01:21:30,705 --> 01:21:32,265
It was...

1332
01:21:32,505 --> 01:21:35,105
It was the Cotton Bowl, Sister Woman.

1333
01:21:53,945 --> 01:21:55,065
Pa?

1334
01:22:34,464 --> 01:22:37,024
- Give me your hand.
- I don't want your hand!

1335
01:23:28,542 --> 01:23:29,502
No.

1336
01:23:29,702 --> 01:23:31,062
It's my pain.

1337
01:23:31,222 --> 01:23:32,982
That makes it my business.

1338
01:23:33,302 --> 01:23:36,062
I thought you went and hid yourself.
What do you want?

1339
01:23:36,302 --> 01:23:38,262
I came to apologize.

1340
01:23:39,702 --> 01:23:41,382
What for, telling me the truth?

1341
01:23:41,582 --> 01:23:44,782
- There must a dozen reasons.
- Save them.

1342
01:23:44,982 --> 01:23:47,502
I hate apologies. Especially for the truth.

1343
01:23:47,702 --> 01:23:50,662
Whatever you did, don't apologize.
Just don't do it again.

1344
01:23:50,862 --> 01:23:52,862
If you didn't do it, start doing it.

1345
01:23:53,062 --> 01:23:55,062
Start by getting me a cigar
out of that coat.

1346
01:23:55,142 --> 01:23:57,662
- You think you ought to...
- Get me the cigar, boy!

1347
01:24:03,342 --> 01:24:04,342
It's wet from rain.

1348
01:24:04,422 --> 01:24:08,302
You're all wet yourself.
It's a lousy joke, but it's true.

1349
01:24:12,021 --> 01:24:13,941
Modern science!

1350
01:24:25,941 --> 01:24:27,421
Get me that...

1351
01:24:31,741 --> 01:24:32,581
...that robe.

1352
01:24:43,981 --> 01:24:46,901
- There's a bottle in that desk.
- I don't want a drink.

1353
01:24:47,101 --> 01:24:48,501
I do.

1354
01:24:48,661 --> 01:24:50,261
I want a drink.

1355
01:24:50,741 --> 01:24:53,301
I've got a million clicks in my guts.

1356
01:24:54,581 --> 01:24:56,981
Knives sharpening themselves.

1357
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:01,980
You know about clicks, don't you?

1358
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:07,300
So you bought me a birthday present, huh?

1359
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:10,300
No, Maggie bought it.

1360
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:15,060
- She's got good taste that girl.
- In some things, yes...

1361
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:16,940
...but not in men.

1362
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,300
Nice soft material.

1363
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,580
This is my soft birthday.

1364
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:27,020
Not my gold or silver.
This is my soft birthday.

1365
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:33,620
Here's to my...

1366
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:35,540
...last birthday.

1367
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:38,820
Aren't you drinking to that?

1368
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:42,579
Clickety-click.

1369
01:25:53,579 --> 01:25:55,739
You know what I'm going to do
before I die?

1370
01:25:56,979 --> 01:25:59,059
I'm going to open up all these boxes.

1371
01:26:01,299 --> 01:26:02,899
Will you look at this stuff?

1372
01:26:03,459 --> 01:26:04,579
Bought most of it...

1373
01:26:04,779 --> 01:26:07,299
...when I took your mother to Europe
on that tour.

1374
01:26:07,379 --> 01:26:10,099
Never had such a lousy time in my life.

1375
01:26:10,419 --> 01:26:13,139
That Europe is nothing
but a great big auction.

1376
01:26:13,419 --> 01:26:16,979
Bunch of old worn-out places.
It's just a big fire sale.

1377
01:26:17,179 --> 01:26:19,179
Big Mama went wild in it.

1378
01:26:19,379 --> 01:26:21,939
She just bought and bought.

1379
01:26:22,659 --> 01:26:25,539
She was lucky I'm a rich man.
Yes, it sure is lucky.

1380
01:26:26,299 --> 01:26:29,298
Got any idea what I'm worth? Ask Gooper.

1381
01:26:29,498 --> 01:26:32,098
He knows to the penny
unless I miss my guess.

1382
01:26:33,458 --> 01:26:36,978
Close on $10 million in cash
and blue-chip stocks...

1383
01:26:37,178 --> 01:26:39,898
...besides some 28,000 acres
of the richest land...

1384
01:26:40,098 --> 01:26:41,858
...this side of the Valley Nile.

1385
01:26:42,058 --> 01:26:44,178
That is pretty rich to be.

1386
01:26:46,858 --> 01:26:51,458
There's one thing you can't buy
in a Europe fire sale...

1387
01:26:51,978 --> 01:26:54,138
...or any other market on earth.

1388
01:26:54,738 --> 01:26:56,298
That's your life.

1389
01:26:59,058 --> 01:27:01,698
You can't buy back your life
when it's finished.

1390
01:27:01,938 --> 01:27:03,738
No, sir. Nobody can do that.

1391
01:27:05,378 --> 01:27:06,778
Feeling sorry for me or you?

1392
01:27:11,218 --> 01:27:12,177
For you, Papa.

1393
01:27:12,337 --> 01:27:14,897
That's good,
because you're going to miss me.

1394
01:27:16,937 --> 01:27:19,377
Why did you let Ma buy all this stuff?

1395
01:27:20,017 --> 01:27:23,817
The human animal is a beast
that eventually has to die.

1396
01:27:24,177 --> 01:27:27,457
If he's got money, he buys and he buys.

1397
01:27:28,337 --> 01:27:31,057
The reason why he buys everything he can,
is because...

1398
01:27:31,137 --> 01:27:34,977
...of a crazy hope that one of the things
he buys will be life everlasting...

1399
01:27:35,537 --> 01:27:37,377
...which it never can be.

1400
01:27:37,777 --> 01:27:41,377
I've suddenly noticed you don't call me
Big Daddy anymore.

1401
01:27:41,577 --> 01:27:44,457
If you needed a Big Daddy,
why didn't you come to me?

1402
01:27:44,657 --> 01:27:48,497
If you wanted someone to lean on, why
Skipper? Why not me? I'm your father.

1403
01:27:48,777 --> 01:27:51,457
You should've come to your kinfolk.
Those who love you.

1404
01:27:51,537 --> 01:27:54,817
You don't know what love means.
To you it's another four-letter word.

1405
01:27:54,897 --> 01:27:56,377
You've got a short memory.

1406
01:27:56,657 --> 01:28:00,376
- What did you want that I didn't buy?
- You can't buy love!

1407
01:28:00,576 --> 01:28:03,816
You bought $1 million worth of junk!
Does it love you?

1408
01:28:04,016 --> 01:28:07,256
Who do you think I bought it for?
It's yours, the place, the money!

1409
01:28:07,456 --> 01:28:09,336
I don't want things!

1410
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,416
We drew this up...

1411
01:28:15,536 --> 01:28:18,856
- We drew this up with the advice...
- Get out of the way.

1412
01:28:20,656 --> 01:28:22,896
- Get out of my way.
- We're settling this first.

1413
01:28:22,976 --> 01:28:25,976
- I don't want to see it.
- It's a sort of a plan. A preliminary.

1414
01:28:33,456 --> 01:28:34,936
Waste!

1415
01:28:44,495 --> 01:28:45,855
Worthless!

1416
01:28:54,415 --> 01:28:55,855
Worthless!

1417
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:17,975
Don't, son.

1418
01:29:19,535 --> 01:29:20,975
Please don't cry.

1419
01:29:35,414 --> 01:29:36,654
That's funny.

1420
01:29:37,254 --> 01:29:40,694
I never saw you cry before.
Did you ever cry as a kid?

1421
01:29:40,774 --> 01:29:45,134
Can't you understand?
I never wanted your place or money.

1422
01:29:45,414 --> 01:29:47,534
I don't want to own anything!

1423
01:29:47,734 --> 01:29:50,894
All I wanted was a father, not a boss!

1424
01:29:51,374 --> 01:29:53,414
I wanted you to love me.

1425
01:29:53,614 --> 01:29:55,094
I did and I do.

1426
01:29:56,134 --> 01:29:58,574
Not me and not Gooper,
and not even Mama.

1427
01:29:58,734 --> 01:30:00,054
That's a lie.

1428
01:30:00,254 --> 01:30:01,694
I loved her. I gave her...

1429
01:30:01,894 --> 01:30:04,854
Things, Papa, you gave her things.

1430
01:30:05,054 --> 01:30:07,494
A house, a trip to Europe, all this junk.

1431
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:11,174
Some jewelry.
You gave her things, not love.

1432
01:30:12,813 --> 01:30:14,613
I gave her an empire.

1433
01:30:14,813 --> 01:30:17,613
I've seen you out there on your empire...

1434
01:30:17,813 --> 01:30:20,853
...with the men who run it for you.
You don't know their names...

1435
01:30:21,053 --> 01:30:24,533
...or if they've kids or are happy.
You've never looked into their faces.

1436
01:30:24,613 --> 01:30:28,093
What are faces? You don't build an empire
by remembering faces.

1437
01:30:28,333 --> 01:30:31,213
Next week,
I'll start building that textile plant.

1438
01:30:31,413 --> 01:30:35,213
I'll not only grow my own cotton,
I'll weave it and market it.

1439
01:30:35,373 --> 01:30:36,093
I'll tell you...

1440
01:30:36,293 --> 01:30:38,613
...in a year or two from now...

1441
01:30:53,693 --> 01:30:57,772
The men who build empires die,
and empires die too.

1442
01:30:58,412 --> 01:30:59,652
No, it won't.

1443
01:30:59,852 --> 01:31:01,772
That's why I've got you and Gooper.

1444
01:31:01,972 --> 01:31:03,172
Look at Gooper.

1445
01:31:03,372 --> 01:31:06,612
Look at what he's become.
Is that what you wanted him to be?

1446
01:31:06,812 --> 01:31:08,252
Look at me.

1447
01:31:08,572 --> 01:31:12,612
You were right. I am a 30-year-old kid.
And pretty soon I'll be a 50-year-old kid.

1448
01:31:12,812 --> 01:31:16,012
I don't know what to believe in.
What's the good of living?

1449
01:31:16,212 --> 01:31:19,612
There's got to be some purpose in life,
some meaning.

1450
01:31:20,212 --> 01:31:23,692
Look at me, for the sake of God,
before it's too late!

1451
01:31:23,852 --> 01:31:26,612
For once, look at me as I really am.

1452
01:31:26,812 --> 01:31:28,052
Look at me!

1453
01:31:29,452 --> 01:31:30,972
I'm a failure. I'm a drunk.

1454
01:31:31,092 --> 01:31:34,572
On my own in the open market,
I'm not worth the price of a decent burial.

1455
01:31:34,772 --> 01:31:39,132
- All of you blame me for everything, huh?
- No, Papa.

1456
01:31:42,491 --> 01:31:45,411
We've known each other all my life
and we're strangers.

1457
01:31:46,011 --> 01:31:50,371
You own 28,000 acres.
You own $10 million.

1458
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:54,771
You own a wife and two children.
You own us, but you don't love us.

1459
01:31:55,731 --> 01:31:58,211
- In my own way...
- No, sir.

1460
01:31:58,611 --> 01:32:00,611
You don't even like people.

1461
01:32:01,531 --> 01:32:04,731
You wanted Gooper and me to have kids.
Why?

1462
01:32:05,851 --> 01:32:09,731
I want a part of me to keep living.
I won't have it end with the grave.

1463
01:32:09,931 --> 01:32:11,091
Look!

1464
01:32:11,691 --> 01:32:14,131
This is what my father left me.

1465
01:32:14,331 --> 01:32:15,771
This lousy old suitcase!

1466
01:32:16,451 --> 01:32:18,651
On the inside was nothing...

1467
01:32:18,851 --> 01:32:22,411
...but his uniform
from the Spanish-American War.

1468
01:32:22,611 --> 01:32:24,851
This was his legacy to me.

1469
01:32:25,051 --> 01:32:26,651
Nothing at all!

1470
01:32:28,650 --> 01:32:31,450
And I built this place from nothing.

1471
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:38,370
And that's all he left you?

1472
01:32:38,730 --> 01:32:41,170
Yeah, he was a hobo.

1473
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:45,490
Best-known tramp on the boxcar circuit.

1474
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:49,090
He worked once in a while as a field hand.
I'd tag along.

1475
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:52,970
Sat on my bare bottom, in the dirt,
waiting for him.

1476
01:32:54,410 --> 01:32:56,090
Outside of hunger...

1477
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:58,650
...first thing I could remember is shame.

1478
01:32:58,850 --> 01:33:01,570
I was ashamed
of that miserable, old tramp.

1479
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:06,170
I was riding boxcars when I was nine,
something you never had to do.

1480
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:09,610
And you'll never have to bury me
like I did him.

1481
01:33:10,290 --> 01:33:13,449
I buried him in a meadow,
alongside a railroad track.

1482
01:33:13,609 --> 01:33:16,889
We were running to catch a freight
and his heart gave out.

1483
01:33:19,809 --> 01:33:21,209
You know something?

1484
01:33:22,489 --> 01:33:24,609
That lousy old tramp died laughing.

1485
01:33:24,809 --> 01:33:26,409
Laughing at what?

1486
01:33:27,369 --> 01:33:29,169
Himself, I guess.

1487
01:33:29,369 --> 01:33:30,769
A hobo tramp...

1488
01:33:30,969 --> 01:33:34,689
...not a nickel in his jeans.
No future, no past.

1489
01:33:36,169 --> 01:33:39,849
Or maybe he was laughing
because he was happy.

1490
01:33:40,729 --> 01:33:42,569
Happy at having you with him.

1491
01:33:42,729 --> 01:33:45,449
He took you everywhere
and he kept you with him.

1492
01:33:47,209 --> 01:33:49,089
I don't want to talk about that.

1493
01:34:03,848 --> 01:34:05,568
Yeah, I loved him.

1494
01:34:09,448 --> 01:34:12,248
I reckon I never loved anything
as much as that...

1495
01:34:12,448 --> 01:34:14,088
...Iousy old tramp.

1496
01:34:15,848 --> 01:34:17,208
And you say...

1497
01:34:17,408 --> 01:34:19,728
...he left you nothing but a suitcase...

1498
01:34:19,928 --> 01:34:23,288
...with a uniform in it
from the Spanish-American War?

1499
01:34:23,808 --> 01:34:25,448
And some memories.

1500
01:34:26,728 --> 01:34:27,928
And love.

1501
01:34:33,568 --> 01:34:35,848
Did I tell you all them stories
about my old man?

1502
01:34:36,048 --> 01:34:37,568
About fifty times.

1503
01:34:51,207 --> 01:34:54,567
It's a plan to protect the Delta's
biggest estate from irresponsibility.

1504
01:34:54,647 --> 01:34:55,607
You have to sign.

1505
01:34:58,727 --> 01:35:00,447
Where is it?

1506
01:35:01,287 --> 01:35:01,927
What?

1507
01:35:02,047 --> 01:35:05,247
What the doctor left
to make his pain easier.

1508
01:35:05,887 --> 01:35:09,447
Brick's down there with him.
He'll help Big Daddy.

1509
01:35:09,647 --> 01:35:11,047
Help him? How?

1510
01:35:11,247 --> 01:35:13,247
By running the 100-yard dash?

1511
01:35:13,447 --> 01:35:16,367
Maybe he'll cheer him up
by kicking some field goals.

1512
01:35:16,647 --> 01:35:19,367
One more crack, Queenie...

1513
01:35:19,527 --> 01:35:23,767
...and I will not only spit in your eye
but I will punch it black and blue.

1514
01:35:23,847 --> 01:35:24,687
Hold on a minute!

1515
01:35:24,767 --> 01:35:27,286
- I'm not listening to any more...
- Mae was only saying...

1516
01:35:27,366 --> 01:35:30,006
I know what she said,
and I know exactly what she meant.

1517
01:35:30,086 --> 01:35:31,886
The only world that Brick knows...

1518
01:35:31,966 --> 01:35:34,126
It's not a world he made.

1519
01:35:38,246 --> 01:35:39,126
Ladies!

1520
01:35:40,966 --> 01:35:43,326
- No.
- Why won't you take it?

1521
01:35:44,286 --> 01:35:47,486
- It'll kill the pain, that's all.
- It'll kill the senses, too.

1522
01:35:47,686 --> 01:35:50,326
When you've got pain
at least you know you're alive.

1523
01:35:56,166 --> 01:35:58,086
It's easing somewhat now.

1524
01:36:00,006 --> 01:36:01,686
When you've got pain...

1525
01:36:02,086 --> 01:36:05,006
...it's better to judge yourself,
a lot of things.

1526
01:36:05,206 --> 01:36:07,606
I'm not going to stupefy myself
with that stuff.

1527
01:36:07,686 --> 01:36:09,286
I want to think clear.

1528
01:36:09,486 --> 01:36:11,886
I want to see everything
and feel everything.

1529
01:36:12,086 --> 01:36:13,765
Then I won't mind going.

1530
01:36:14,885 --> 01:36:16,965
I've got the guts to die.

1531
01:36:17,165 --> 01:36:20,005
What I want to know is,
have you got the guts to live?

1532
01:36:20,365 --> 01:36:21,765
I don't know.

1533
01:36:23,045 --> 01:36:24,525
We can try.

1534
01:36:26,365 --> 01:36:29,285
We could start by helping each other
up these stairs.

1535
01:36:41,285 --> 01:36:42,445
Yes, sir.

1536
01:36:45,885 --> 01:36:46,965
At least read them.

1537
01:36:47,085 --> 01:36:49,245
Put those papers away
before I tear them up.

1538
01:36:49,445 --> 01:36:51,605
I don't want to know what's in them.

1539
01:36:51,805 --> 01:36:56,085
I'm talking in Big Daddy's language.
I'm his wife, not his widow. His wife!

1540
01:36:56,445 --> 01:36:58,724
- What I've got here...
- He said it's just a plan.

1541
01:36:58,804 --> 01:37:02,484
Plan basis. What I'll say to your plan is...

1542
01:37:04,044 --> 01:37:07,044
What is it Big Daddy says
when he's disgusted?

1543
01:37:07,244 --> 01:37:10,084
He says "bull" when he's disgusted.

1544
01:37:10,244 --> 01:37:12,844
That's right. I say "bull" like Big Daddy.

1545
01:37:13,044 --> 01:37:15,804
- Coarse language don't seem called for.
- Bull!

1546
01:37:16,004 --> 01:37:17,924
I am outraged by this kind of talk.

1547
01:37:18,004 --> 01:37:21,004
Then stop talking like your father's dead
and me along with him.

1548
01:37:21,084 --> 01:37:23,044
What about her? She wants her share, too.

1549
01:37:24,244 --> 01:37:26,324
As far as Brick is concerned...

1550
01:37:26,524 --> 01:37:28,964
...nobody's going to take nothing.

1551
01:37:29,164 --> 01:37:30,804
Not till Big Daddy lets go...

1552
01:37:31,004 --> 01:37:34,884
...and maybe just possibly, not even then!

1553
01:37:35,204 --> 01:37:37,124
No, Mama, not even then.

1554
01:37:41,124 --> 01:37:42,843
Hello, Bucky!

1555
01:37:45,603 --> 01:37:48,323
Looks like the wind took some liberties
with this place.

1556
01:37:48,483 --> 01:37:50,163
- Evening, Cap'n!
- Evening, Cap'n!

1557
01:37:50,243 --> 01:37:52,843
- Storm cross over the river?
- Gone to Arkansas.

1558
01:37:53,043 --> 01:37:54,723
Rain do some good, Cap'n?

1559
01:37:54,883 --> 01:37:56,483
Some good, I reckon.

1560
01:37:58,403 --> 01:37:59,643
Some good.

1561
01:38:01,283 --> 01:38:02,643
You could at least read them.

1562
01:38:02,723 --> 01:38:05,763
Put them away before I tear them up.
I don't know what's in them.

1563
01:38:05,923 --> 01:38:07,363
I don't want to know.

1564
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:10,083
Can I come in?

1565
01:38:11,883 --> 01:38:14,483
Has the storm done any damage?

1566
01:38:14,683 --> 01:38:17,203
Which storm are you talking about?
The one outside...

1567
01:38:17,283 --> 01:38:19,203
...or that hullabaloo going on in here?

1568
01:38:27,562 --> 01:38:28,682
Excuse me, sir.

1569
01:38:29,002 --> 01:38:33,322
Heard some mighty loud talking.
What's the powwow about?

1570
01:38:33,682 --> 01:38:36,602
Nothing, Big Daddy. Nothing at all.

1571
01:38:37,082 --> 01:38:40,082
What's in them important-Iooking
documents you've got there?

1572
01:38:40,482 --> 01:38:43,042
Nothing. Nothing much of anything at all.

1573
01:38:43,322 --> 01:38:47,682
Then what are you and Sister Woman
scurrying and scrounging around for?

1574
01:38:48,282 --> 01:38:50,722
Looks like a whole lot of nothing to me.

1575
01:38:53,882 --> 01:38:55,922
What's that smell in this room?

1576
01:38:56,722 --> 01:38:58,402
Didn't you notice it, Brick?

1577
01:38:59,042 --> 01:39:02,682
Didn't you notice the powerful
and obnoxious odor of mendacity?

1578
01:39:06,082 --> 01:39:08,562
Yes, sir, I think I did.

1579
01:39:08,762 --> 01:39:12,002
Ain't nothing more powerful
than the odor of mendacity.

1580
01:39:13,081 --> 01:39:15,441
- Didn't you notice it, Gooper?
- What, sir?

1581
01:39:15,681 --> 01:39:17,641
What about you, Sister Woman?

1582
01:39:17,841 --> 01:39:21,361
Didn't you notice an unpleasant smell
of mendacity in this room?

1583
01:39:21,841 --> 01:39:24,041
I don't even know what that is.

1584
01:39:24,241 --> 01:39:27,681
You can smell it. It smells like death.

1585
01:39:32,201 --> 01:39:36,001
What's the matter with that woman?
What's-your-name, what's wrong?

1586
01:39:36,361 --> 01:39:39,161
She just had a slight dizzy spell.

1587
01:39:39,361 --> 01:39:41,681
You'd better watch that.
A stroke's a bad way to go.

1588
01:39:44,361 --> 01:39:47,881
Look, he's wearing
Brick's birthday present.

1589
01:39:49,041 --> 01:39:52,481
I haven't given you my present yet
but I will now.

1590
01:39:52,801 --> 01:39:54,481
I have an announcement.

1591
01:39:54,681 --> 01:39:56,441
What kind of an announcement?

1592
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,960
An announcement of life beginning.

1593
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,240
A child is coming...

1594
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,720
...sired by Brick out of Maggie the cat.

1595
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,720
I have Brick's child in my body.

1596
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,520
And that is my present to you.

1597
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:20,600
Did you ever in your born days
hear such a bald-faced lie?

1598
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:21,920
Shut up.

1599
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:25,000
Thank you.

1600
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:26,920
Thank you very much.

1601
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,479
Yes, indeed, this girl has life in her body.

1602
01:40:44,479 --> 01:40:46,079
And that's no lie.

1603
01:40:46,999 --> 01:40:50,279
I want my lawyer in the morning.
My lawyer!

1604
01:40:51,839 --> 01:40:53,879
- Brick?
- Yes, Big Daddy?

1605
01:40:56,519 --> 01:40:59,439
I'm going out to look this place over
before I give it up.

1606
01:40:59,919 --> 01:41:01,959
The place and the people on it.

1607
01:41:07,959 --> 01:41:09,359
You want to come with me?

1608
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:24,839
What were you two talking about
down there?

1609
01:41:24,919 --> 01:41:25,799
Us.

1610
01:41:26,199 --> 01:41:27,318
Me, too?

1611
01:41:28,158 --> 01:41:28,798
Yeah.

1612
01:41:28,998 --> 01:41:31,638
You ripped your own brother apart.

1613
01:41:32,918 --> 01:41:34,518
Do you believe that, Gooper?

1614
01:41:38,518 --> 01:41:39,918
- No.
- Well, I do!

1615
01:41:40,118 --> 01:41:41,038
Keep still.

1616
01:41:41,238 --> 01:41:45,358
A family crisis brings out the best
and the worst in every member.

1617
01:41:45,678 --> 01:41:47,078
That's the truth.

1618
01:41:47,318 --> 01:41:48,478
Amen.

1619
01:41:49,438 --> 01:41:52,638
You want to talk about the truth?
You're not pregnant.

1620
01:41:52,798 --> 01:41:54,158
- Be still.
- She made it up.

1621
01:41:54,358 --> 01:41:57,478
- I said shut up.
- Don't you try to kid us.

1622
01:41:58,918 --> 01:42:00,638
She's not kidding you.

1623
01:42:00,838 --> 01:42:04,118
How can she have a child by you,
when you won't even...

1624
01:42:04,358 --> 01:42:05,278
Keep quiet!

1625
01:42:05,478 --> 01:42:08,998
We occupy the next room
and the walls aren't soundproof.

1626
01:42:09,198 --> 01:42:13,517
We hear the nightly pleading
and the nightly refusals!

1627
01:42:13,717 --> 01:42:16,677
Not everybody makes as much noise
about love as you do.

1628
01:42:20,317 --> 01:42:23,757
I never thought you would stoop
to her level!

1629
01:42:23,837 --> 01:42:27,037
You heard what Big Daddy said,
"That girl's got life in her body."

1630
01:42:27,117 --> 01:42:28,757
- That's a lie!
- No.

1631
01:42:30,157 --> 01:42:32,637
No, truth is something desperate,
and Maggie's got it.

1632
01:42:32,717 --> 01:42:36,037
Believe me, it is desperate,
and she has got it.

1633
01:42:37,637 --> 01:42:40,437
Why don't you say something, honey?

1634
01:42:40,957 --> 01:42:42,477
All right, honey.

1635
01:42:42,677 --> 01:42:43,717
Shut up!

1636
01:42:47,837 --> 01:42:48,957
Yes?

1637
01:42:49,117 --> 01:42:50,717
Come on up here.

1638
01:42:51,957 --> 01:42:52,997
Yes, sir!

1639
01:43:02,516 --> 01:43:04,476
That girl's got life in her, all right.

1640
01:43:07,436 --> 01:43:09,996
Thank you for keeping still.

1641
01:43:10,316 --> 01:43:12,436
For backing me up in my lie.

1642
01:43:14,476 --> 01:43:18,076
We are through with lies
and liars in this house.

1643
01:43:19,796 --> 01:43:20,996
Lock the door.

1644
01:43:21,305 --> 01:44:21,449
