7
00:01:58,492 --> 00:01:59,952
NO, FOR MISS LUTIE.

8
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,454
I'LL TAKE IT UP TO HER.

9
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:03,456
MISS LUTIE UP IN HER ROOM?

10
00:02:03,497 --> 00:02:04,457
THEY'RE ALL UP THERE.

11
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:06,459
WOULDN'T YOU THINK
THEY'D GET TIRED

12
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,460
OF LOOKING AT THEMSELVES?

13
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:08,461
WEDDINGS!

14
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:10,463
I'LL BE SO GLAD WHEN IT'S OVER.

15
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:11,464
HURRY UP, RACHAEL.

16
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:13,466
WHAT FOR?
IT AIN'T TILL 3 DAYS.

17
00:02:13,507 --> 00:02:15,468
RACHAEL, HAVE YOU
EVER BEEN MARRIED?

18
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:17,470
YES'EM-HERE AND THERE
NOW AND THEN.

19
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,473
WHERE'S LUTIE?

20
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:22,475
SHE'S IN THERE.
SHE'S TRYING IT ON.

21
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:24,977
MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN YOU
CAN IMAGINE!

22
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,981
MAY I SEE YOU,
LUTIE?

23
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,484
ONE MINUTE, FATHER!
LET HIM IN, RACHAEL.

24
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,989
YOU LOOK FINE.

25
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,491
THEN SMILE!
- SMILE?

26
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:40,493
YOU HAVEN'T SMILED
ONCE SINCE I GOT ENGAGED.

27
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:41,494
WHY, LUTIE, I...

28
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:43,496
THE TWO LONGEST THINGS
IN ST. LOUIS-

29
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:44,997
YOUR FACE AND THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER.

30
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,499
WELL, I ONLY WANT
YOUR HAPPINESS, LUTIE.

31
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:48,501
AND I JUST KEEP THINKING
ONE THING:

32
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:49,376
JIM BREWTON IS ALL RIGHT.

33
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:51,003
HE'S GREAT IN SALT FORK
TERRITORY OF NEW MEXICO

34
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,505
AND YOU'RE ALL RIGHT
IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI.

35
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:54,006
STOP IT, DARLING.

36
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,800
AND THEN I THINK OF
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER,

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,509
AND NEITHER PLACE-

38
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,510
I KNOW IT'S GOING
TO BE RIGHT.

39
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:59,220
AND, LUTIE, SUCH A
A SHORT COURTSHIP.

40
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,012
A COWMAN!

41
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,514
BUT SUCH A COWMAN.

42
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:04,016
REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID
WHEN YOU INTRODUCED US.

43
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,518
THAT'S RIGHT,
I DID INTRODUCE YOU.

44
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,019
HERE'S A TELEGRAM
FOR YOU.

45
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,521
OH, THANKS.
IT'S PROBABLY FROM HIM.

46
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:10,523
HE MUST HAVE LEFT.
HE SAID HE'D WIRE

47
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:12,024
THE MINUTE HE GOT
ON THE TRAIN.

48
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,527
DELAYED. CAN'T-

49
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:16,529
GET TO ST. LOUIS FCR WEDDING.

50
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,488
TAKE FIRST TRAIN

51
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,031
BE MARRIED HERE. LOVE, JIM.

52
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,032
WELL!

53
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,535
FATHER, THIS IS NOT FUNNY.

54
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:24,537
WELL, YOU ASKED ME
TO SMILE, DIDN'T YOU?

55
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,420
YOU DONE IT-

56
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,548
TRAIN'S EARLY, 3/4 OF AN HOUR!

57
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,050
AND 33 SECONDS.
I GOT A STOPWATCH.

58
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:01,031
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
IF SAM DOESN'T MEET YOU?

59
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:02,783
DON'T WORRY.
YOU HEARD THE CONDUCTOR-

60
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:03,534
TRAIN'S EARLY.

61
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,536
YOUR MAN AIN'T
SHOWED UP, NEITHER.

62
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,037
SAMMY!

63
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,042
SAMMY!
- SELINA!

64
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,546
HELLO, SPROUT.
YOU'VE GROWED!

65
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,548
REGULAR BUSTER,
AIN'T SHE?

66
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,049
SAM, THIS IS
LUTIE CAMERON.

67
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,051
WE KEPT EACH OTHER COMPANY
ON THE ROAD OUT.

68
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,553
SHE SPELLED ME WITH MOLLY.

69
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,054
HAPPY TO KNOW YOU, SAM.

70
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,556
I'VE HEARD
A LOT ABOUT YOU.

71
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:27,558
NO MORE THAN I HEARD
OF HER MAN.

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,559
MAYBE I KNOW HIM.
HOMESTEADER?

73
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,561
CATTLEMAN.
- OH.

74
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,563
NAME OF JIM BREWTON.

75
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,064
COLONEL BREWTON?
- MM-HMM.

76
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:37,568
YES, I KNOW HIM.

77
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,574
I SURE THANK YOU FOR HELPING
THE WIFE OUT, MA'AM.

78
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:45,576
COME ON, HONEY.

79
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,578
ALL RIGHT, SAM.
GOODBYE, LUTIE.

80
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,579
GOODBYE, SELINA.

81
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,080
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

82
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:51,582
WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER.

83
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,085
BE A GOOD GIRL,
BUTTON-NOSE.

84
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:06,096
THERE'S A-A HOTEL?

85
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:08,599
SURE. EXCHANGE HOUSE
OVER THERE.

86
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,100
THANK YOU.

87
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:12,603
COLONE BREWTON WILL
CALL FOR THIS LUGGAGE.

88
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,104
YES, MA'AM.

89
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:21,130
I'M SORRY
TO DISTURB YOU

90
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:23,132
BUT WILL YOU
HELP ME, PLEASE?

91
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:35,144
OH, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

92
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:37,146
I'LL BE A SON OF A GUN.

93
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:38,147
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

94
00:06:38,188 --> 00:06:40,149
I SAID,
I'M A SON OF A GUN.

95
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,192
IT ISN'T POSSIBLE. OF COURSE NOW,
IS IT? - WHAT?

96
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:43,652
THAT YOU ARE MISS LUTIE CAMERON

97
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,153
OF ST. LOUIS AND POINTS EAST.

98
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:46,655
SHE ARRIVES ON THE 3:00.

99
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,156
THEY'RE SENDING UP
ROCKETS THEN.

100
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:49,157
THE TRAIN WAS EARLY.

101
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:51,660
TRUST JIM BREWTON
TO PICK A WOMAN

102
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,662
WITH HAIR THE COLOR
OF CHILI PEPPER.

103
00:06:54,162 --> 00:06:55,664
WELL, DON'T WORRY,
I LIKE IT.

104
00:06:56,164 --> 00:06:58,166
WELL, IF YOU KNOW COLONEL
BREWTON, YOU CAN HELP ME.

105
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:01,169
EVERYBODY KNOWS JIM BREWTON,
SOME TO THEIR SORROW.

106
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:03,672
YOUR IMPENDING ARRIVAL
HAS CREATED QUITE A STIR

107
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:05,173
IN SALT FORK,
MISS CAMERON.

108
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:07,175
BREATHS HAVE BEEN
WELL-BATED.

109
00:07:07,175 --> 00:07:09,177
I SHALL NOW BATE MINE AGAIN.

110
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:12,639
YOU'RE MAKING THE MISTAKE
OF YOUR LIFE, YOU KNOW.

111
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:14,641
THERE'S A TRAIN OUT
OF HERE TOMORROW.

112
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:16,143
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D BE ON IT.

113
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:17,144
WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY?

114
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:18,645
THE NAME'S BRICE CHAMBERLAIN.

115
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:21,148
HOWEVER, "WHAT," NOT "WHO,"
IS THE IMPORTANT THING.

116
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:23,650
I, MISS CAMERON,
AM AN IDEALIST-

117
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:26,153
A PRACTICING IDEALIST.

118
00:07:26,194 --> 00:07:27,654
LOOK AROUND YOU,
MISS CAMERON.

119
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:29,156
YOU'RE OUT OF PLACE.

120
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:33,160
THE WINE OF THE COW COUNTRY
IS REDEYE, NOT CHAMPAGNE.

121
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:34,661
REDEYE...
- REDEYE.

122
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:37,164
A VERY INFERIOR
BRAND OF WHISKEY.

123
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:38,665
NEVER TOUCH
THE STUFF MYSELF.

124
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:40,667
UNDERSTAND BREWTON
DOES, THOUGH.

125
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:43,670
I SHOULD BE VERY ANGRY.
I GUESS I AM.

126
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:45,839
ON THE OTHER HAND, MAYBE I'M NOT.

127
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,673
I DON'T KNOW.

128
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:48,175
THIS IS SUCH
A PLACE.

129
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:51,678
COME ON, MR. CHAMBERLAIN,
JURY'S COMING IN.

130
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,096
WE BETTER GET OVER THERE.

131
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:54,681
BREWTON AIN'T SHOWED UP YET.

132
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:56,683
SURE, ANDY. MEET YOU
AT THE COURTHOUSE.

133
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:58,685
IS THAT WHERE COLONEL BREWTON IS,
AT THE COURTHOUSE?

134
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:00,187
THAT'S WHERE I LEFT HIM.

135
00:08:00,228 --> 00:08:02,689
WHY, YOU'RE HIS ENEMY,
AREN'T YOU?

136
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:04,191
HIS NATURAL ENEMY.

137
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:07,194
WE'RE MAKING HISTORY IN SALT FORK
TODAY, MISS CAMERON.

138
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:09,696
I HOPE IT WILL BE
THE RIGHT KIND.

139
00:08:10,197 --> 00:08:12,699
IF BREWTON HAS HIS WAY
IT WON'T BE.

140
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:21,708
QUIET DOWN, FOLKS,
QUIET DOWN!

141
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,212
QUIET IN THE COURTHOUSE, BOYS.
THE COURT'S IN SESSION NOW.

142
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:41,728
GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY

143
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:43,230
HAV E YOU REACHED A DECISION?

144
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,233
YES, SIR, WE HAVE-
UNANIMOUS.

145
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:47,234
HOW FIND YOU?

146
00:08:47,234 --> 00:08:49,736
ARE THE DEFENDANTS GUILTY
OR NOT GUILTY?

147
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:51,696
WE FIND THAT
ANDY BOGGS HERE

148
00:08:51,738 --> 00:08:54,199
WAS SHOT AND RUN OFF
THE LAND HE FILED ON

149
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:56,201
BY PARTIES UNKNOWN.

150
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:57,702
WELL, THAT VERDICT
DON'T SETTLE ANYTHING.

151
00:08:57,744 --> 00:08:59,204
HOW ABOUT
THE DEFENDANTS HERE-

152
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:00,705
IKE RANDALL
AND BILL ROACH?

153
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:03,041
YOU MEAN, THE BOYS
WHAT DONE THE SHOOTIN'?

154
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:03,834
THEY AIN'T GUILTY.

155
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:17,222
DEFENDANTS RELEASED.
COURT'S ADJOURNED!

156
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:19,224
JUST ONE MOMENT,
GENTLEMEN!

157
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:23,728
THIS TRIAL'S OVER, BUT AS
ATTORNEY FOR THE PLAINTIFFS,

158
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:26,731
THERE ARE STILL A FEW
THINGS STICKING IN MY CRAW.

159
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:28,733
SWALLOW QUICK,
AND MAYBE THEY'LL GO AWAY.

160
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:31,236
COLONEL BREWTON, I WONDER,
NOW THAT WE'VE LOST

161
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,738
IF YOU'D OBLIGE ME
BY ANSWERING A FEW QUESTIONS.

162
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,740
LET'S SAY, AS A SPORTING
PROPOSITION.

163
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:37,242
TROUBLE WITH YOU IS,
YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU'RE LICKED.

164
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:40,245
NO, HE DOESN'T, MAC.
WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE HIM THAT.

165
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:41,746
ALL RIGHT, SIR
GO AHEAD.

166
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:44,249
JUST REMEMBER, I'VE GOT A
3 O'CLOCK TRAIN TO MEET.

167
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:47,252
THANK YOU,
I'LL BE BRIEF.

168
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:48,044
COLONEL BREWTON,

169
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:49,754
HOW MUCH CATTLE RANGE DO YOU CONTROL?

170
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:52,257
I'VE HEARD IT RUNS
INTO A MILLION OR MORE ACRES.

171
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,258
I'VE NEVER COUNTED THEM.

172
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:56,261
THEN AGAIN, I'VE HEARD
THAT IT'S 100 SQUARE MILES.

173
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:57,637
IN ANY CASE YOU WILL ADMIT

174
00:09:57,637 --> 00:09:59,264
THAT'S A LOT OF LAND FOR ONE MAN.

175
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:01,766
WELL, I RUN A LOT OF COWS.

176
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:04,269
IS IT TRUE THAT OF THIS
VAST AMOUNT OF PROPERTY

177
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:06,271
YOU ACTUALLY OWN ONLY
A FEW SCATTERED WATER HOLES

178
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:07,189
THAT ARE FILED ON

179
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,274
EITHER IN YOUR NAME
OR THOSE OF YOUR MEN?

180
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:11,276
AND THAT BY FAR
THE GREATER PART OF IT

181
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:12,777
STILL BELONGS
TO THE GOVERNMENT.

182
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:14,279
LEGALLY, YES.

183
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:17,782
IS IT TRUE, THEN THAT
MILLION OR MORE ACRES

184
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:19,284
STILL BELONGING
TO THE GOVERNMENT,

185
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:21,786
IS THE SAME LAND FROM
WHICH ANDREW BOGGS

186
00:10:21,786 --> 00:10:25,790
WHO MERELY WANTED 160 ACRES
FOR A HOMESTEAD.

187
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,293
WAS RUN OFF AND
SEVERELY WOUNDED

188
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:30,295
BY PARTIES UNKNOWN.

189
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:31,796
BOGGS WAS NOT
RUN OFF BECAUSE

190
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:33,798
HE WANTED TO SETTLE
THE 160 ACRES

191
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:36,301
BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT
HE WANTED TO DO WITH THE LAND.

192
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,761
LET'S FORGET
ABOUT THIS CASE.

193
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:40,263
ANDREW BOGGS IS ONLY
A SINGLE MAN,

194
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:42,766
AND THE COURT HAS
ALREADY DISPOSED OF HIM.

195
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:45,268
BUT WAITING AT
THE EDGE OF SALT FORK

196
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,771
TO HEAR THE OUTCOME OF THIS TRIAL
ARE OTHER SETTLERS.

197
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:50,273
MEN WITH FAMILIES,

198
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:52,275
WHO'VE DRIVEN THEIR WAGONS
MORE THAN 1,000 MILES

199
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:54,778
ACROSS THE PLAINS
AND LEFT THEIR DEAD

200
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:56,780
FROM THE MISSISSIPPI
TO THE RIO GRANDE

201
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:59,282
ALL WITH ONE PURPOSE-
TO FIND HOMES

202
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:01,284
FOR THEMSELVES IN THIS GREAT TERRITORY.

203
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:04,287
I WANT TO ASK IN THE NAMES
OF THESE FAMILIES

204
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:07,791
IF YOU WON'T LET THEM SETTLE
UNDISTURBED ON A FEW ACRES

205
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,795
OUT OF THE MILLIONS OR MORE
OF GOVERNMENT LAND ON YOUR RANGE.

206
00:11:15,298 --> 00:11:18,802
CHAMBERLAIN, I HAVE SYMPATHY
FOR THE EARLY PIONEER

207
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:20,804
WHO CAME OUT HERE
AND RISKED HIS LIFE

208
00:11:21,304 --> 00:11:22,806
AND HIS FAMILY'S
AMONG THE INDIANS,

209
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:26,309
AND I HOPE I HAVE A LITTLE CHARITY
FOR THE NESTOR

210
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:28,812
WHO WAITED UNTIL THE COUNTRY
WAS SAFE AND PEACEABLE

211
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:30,814
BEFORE HE FILED HIS HOMESTEAD
ON THE RANGE

212
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:33,817
OF SOMEONE ELSE WHO
HAD FOUGHT FOR IT.

213
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:36,820
BUT WHEN THAT NESTOR PICKS
LAND LIKE MY BIG VEGA,

214
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:38,822
WHICH IS 7000 FEET ABOVE THE SEA

215
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:40,824
WHICH WAS NATURALLY
INTENDED FOR

216
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:42,325
GRAZING LAND, AND ALWAYS WILL
BE GRAZING LAND,

217
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:45,328
WHEN HE WANT TO PLOW IT UP
TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY

218
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,831
WHERE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH RAIN
FOR THE CROPS TO GROW,

219
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:50,333
WHEN HE ONLY KILLS
THE GRASS THAT WILL GROW,

220
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:52,836
AND THEN, WHEN HIS CROPS
STARVE FOR WATER,

221
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:54,838
SUPPORTS HIS FAMILY
BY KILLING MY BEEF,

222
00:11:55,338 --> 00:11:57,340
AND BECOMES A MAN WITHOUT
RESPECT TO HIMSELF

223
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:59,342
AND A MENACE
TO THE TERRITORY,

224
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:00,844
THEN I HAVE NEITHER SYMPATHY
NOR CHARITY.

225
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,352
AND IF I KNOW THE TEMPER
OF THE PEOPLE AROUND HERE

226
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:11,354
WHAT ANDY BOGGS GOT
IS JUST A SAMPLE OF

227
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:13,356
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF OTHERS
TRY IT.

228
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:20,822
THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS
NO JUSTICE HERE

229
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:23,825
AND THAT YOU DOMINATED
THE COUNTRY.

230
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:24,826
THEY WERE RIGHT.

231
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,341
WELL, WE WON, JIM.

232
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:42,844
BOYS, I'VE GOT A TRAIN TO MEET.

233
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:44,846
JIM! JIM!

234
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:46,347
JIM!

235
00:12:52,353 --> 00:12:54,355
PARDON, PARDON.

236
00:12:54,397 --> 00:12:58,860
JIM, THE TRAIN
BROKE A RECORD.

237
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:02,363
I'LL MAKE UP FOR THAT LATER.

238
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:06,367
OH, I WANT YOU TO MEET A FRIEND
OF MINE, DOC REID.

239
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:07,869
HOW DO YOU DO?
- THIS IS JUDGE WHITE.

240
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:09,370
HOW DO YOU DO?
- HOW DO YOU DO?

241
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:10,371
FLOYD McCURTIN.

242
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:11,873
HOW DO YOU DO?
- HOW DO YOU DO?

243
00:13:12,373 --> 00:13:14,375
WELL, WE WON, DIDN'T WE?

244
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:15,877
WHATEVER IT WAS.

245
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,378
WE HAD TO.

246
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,381
DID WE, JIM?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

247
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:22,383
WE WON TODAY,
BUT I DIDN'T LIKE

248
00:13:22,425 --> 00:13:25,386
THAT BEAT LOOK
IN ANDY BOGGS' EYES.

249
00:13:25,428 --> 00:13:27,889
YOU GET ENOUGH MEN LOOKING
LIKE THAT..

250
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:30,391
WELL, I DON'T LIKE
WHAT I SEE COMING.

251
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:31,893
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

252
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:33,895
OH, THE DOC-
HE DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

253
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:35,897
YOU'LL GET TO KNOW THE DOC.

254
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:38,399
I HOPE I GET TO KNOW ALL
OF YOU.

255
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:40,902
AND THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO LIKE ME

256
00:13:40,944 --> 00:13:43,404
AS WELL AS I'M GOING
TO LIKE YOU.

257
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:45,907
THERE YOU ARE, BOYS,
DO YOU SEE NOW WHY I DID IT?

258
00:13:45,907 --> 00:13:49,410
SURE DO. BUT NOW WE'RE WONDERING
WHY YOU WAITED SO LONG.

259
00:13:51,412 --> 00:13:52,413
COME ON.

260
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,913
SUCH A HURRY, JIM.
6:00 IN THE MORNING.

261
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:37,417
COME ON. YOU'LL BE THE FIRST WOMAN
IN THE TERRITORY

262
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,918
EVER MARRIED IN HER SLEEP.

263
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:33,473
WE MADE IT.

264
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:36,476
WHAT DID WE MAKE, JIM?
WHERE ARE WE?

265
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:38,478
THE GREATEST PLACE I KNOW.
COME ON.

266
00:15:47,945 --> 00:15:50,448
THERE IT IS.

267
00:15:53,951 --> 00:15:55,953
IT'S ALL GRASS.

268
00:15:55,995 --> 00:15:57,455
YEAH.

269
00:15:57,497 --> 00:15:59,457
WELL, IT'S JUST...

270
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:01,959
IT'S SO EMPTY,
SO QUIET.

271
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,461
QUIET?

272
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:07,965
MORE NOISE OUT THERE
THAN THERE IS IN ST. LOUIS.

273
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:09,967
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.

274
00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:13,971
WELL, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN FOR IT
BEFORE YOU CAN.

275
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:16,474
I'M LISTENING, JIM.

276
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:19,477
ALL I HEAR IS THAT LITTLE
WHISTLE OF A SOUND.

277
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:20,978
THE WIND?

278
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,481
THERE'S A LOT MORE
THAN THAT OUT THERE.

279
00:16:23,522 --> 00:16:24,982
TELL ME, JIM-WHAT?

280
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:28,486
WELL...

281
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:29,987
NO, PLEASE TELL ME.

282
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:31,489
I'LL TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

283
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,990
WHAT DO YOU HEAR
OUT THERE?

284
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:38,996
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
I GUESS I HEAR THE BUFFALO.

285
00:16:39,038 --> 00:16:42,500
BUFFALO? BUT THEY AREN'T
THERE ANYMORE.

286
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,502
THAT'S RIGHT.

287
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:48,506
OH. WHAT ELSE, JIM?i

288
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:51,509
INDIANS.

289
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,511
GONE, TOO?

290
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:56,013
HERDED INTO
A RESERVATION.

291
00:16:56,055 --> 00:17:00,518
I CAN REMEMBER THE FIRST
TIME I SAW HER.

292
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,521
WE'D COME A LONG WAY
AND NOBODY WAS TELLING US

293
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:06,023
ABOUT ANY SURPRISES, EITHER.

294
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:09,026
WE JUST CAME OVER THE HILL
AND THERE SHE WAS

295
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:11,028
SORT OF LYING THERE ALL ALONE.

296
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,030
NOBODY WANTED HER THEN...

297
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,033
EXCEPT THE ANTELOPE AND THE BUFFALO
AND THE INDIANS.

298
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:20,037
SO WE TOOK HER, AND WE SET HER UP
RIGHT FOR COW COUNTRY.

299
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:22,039
WE FOUGHT FOR HER.

300
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:25,543
OUR BLOOD'S SUNK
IN EVERY MILE.

301
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:27,545
INDIAN BLOOD, TOO.

302
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:30,548
I'M NOT SO PROUD
OF SOME OF THAT.

303
00:17:32,508 --> 00:17:34,010
MY BROTHER'S OUT THERE.

304
00:17:36,512 --> 00:17:39,515
I SUPPOSE I SOUNDED HARD
TO YOU BACK AT THE TRIAL

305
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:41,017
AND TO EVERYBODY ELSE.

306
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:43,019
AND I SUPPOSE IT'S HARD
TO UNDERSTAND

307
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,021
THAT ALL THAT OUT THERE
IS ANYTHING BUT JUST A LOT OF GRASS

308
00:17:46,063 --> 00:17:50,025
MADE TO ORDER
FOR FARMING.

309
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:53,028
YES, I SUPPOSE IT IS
JUST GRASS TO MOST.

310
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:56,031
BUT NOT TO YOU, JIM?

311
00:17:56,532 --> 00:17:59,034
TO ME, IT'S LAND THE WAY GOD
MADE IT

312
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:01,537
AND WANTS IT TO STAY.

313
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:04,540
AND I MAY BE WRONG
BUT I'VE GOT A HUNCH

314
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,043
THAT HE WANTS ME TO HELP
HIM KEEP IT THAT WAY.

315
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:17,052
I KNOW IT'S TOO SOON TO EXPECT
YOU TO SEE IT THAT WAY, LUTIE

316
00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:19,054
BUT YOU WILL
SEE IT SOME DAY.

317
00:18:19,096 --> 00:18:20,556
YOU'VE GOT TO SEE IT.

318
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:22,057
I WANT TO, JIM.

319
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:44,580
WELL, THERE SHE IS.

320
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:45,581
THE RANCH.

321
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:47,583
AND A HOUSE.

322
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,084
HURRY, JIM.

323
00:19:17,571 --> 00:19:20,074
IT'S BETTER INSIDE.

324
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:21,575
YOU BRING MY SHORTENING?

325
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:23,577
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING
BETTER THAN SHORTENING.

326
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:25,579
HERE IT IS.

327
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:27,581
JEFF, OUR COOK.

328
00:19:27,623 --> 00:19:30,084
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF
RIGHT NOW, JEFF?

329
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,086
I'M THINKING OF
MY SHORTENING.

330
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:34,588
BANTY, COME HERE.
THIS IS BANTY OUR HORSE WRANGLER.

331
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:36,090
HOW ARE YOU, BANTY?

332
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,092
I'M FINE, MA'AM.
YOU'RE WELCOME, MA'AM.

333
00:19:38,592 --> 00:19:40,094
THANK YOU. THAT'S A WONDERFUL
WORD, "WELCOME."

334
00:19:40,594 --> 00:19:42,596
GET THOSE BAGS
WILL YOU, JEFF?

335
00:19:42,638 --> 00:19:44,098
COME ON, I'LL SHOW YOU
THE LAYOUT.

336
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:46,100
FINE. CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE THE KITCHEN.

337
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:47,601
SHE'S SURE NICE
TO LOOK AT.

338
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:50,104
SHE BETTER KEEP OUT
OF MY KITCHEN.

339
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:52,106
AND YOU CAN TAKE THEM BAGS IN.

340
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:07,621
MY...

341
00:20:07,663 --> 00:20:09,623
THIS WILL FIX UP NICELY.

342
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:21,635
THE STOREROOM?

343
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:24,138
NO, NO, THIS IS THE PARLOR.
THE LIVING ROOM.

344
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,142
WHO LIVES IN IT,
DEAR?

345
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:30,144
WELL, NOBODY, REALLY,
VERY MUCH.

346
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:33,147
YOU SEE, WE'RE NOT
HERE VERY MUCH.

347
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:36,650
I, UH... I SUPPOSE IF THIS STUFF
WAS MOVED OUT OF HERE,

348
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:38,652
IT EVENTUALLY WOULD GET
TO LOOK

349
00:20:38,694 --> 00:20:40,654
LIKE A LIVING ROOM,
WOULDN'T IT?

350
00:20:40,654 --> 00:20:42,156
YES, I SUPPOSE IT WOULD.

351
00:20:42,656 --> 00:20:44,658
I WONDER WHY I DIDN'T
HAVE THIS STUFF

352
00:20:44,658 --> 00:20:46,660
MOVED OUT BEFORE YOU CAME?

353
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,162
DO YOU KNOW?

354
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:49,663
NO, I REALLY DON'T.

355
00:20:50,164 --> 00:20:52,166
WELL, I'LL BE DOGGONE,
NEITHER DO I.

356
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:55,669
I WANT TO SEE
THE KITCHEN.

357
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:58,130
IT'S AT THE END
OF THE HALL.

358
00:20:58,172 --> 00:21:00,132
UH, TAKE IT EASY
WITH JEFF.

359
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,641
JUDAS.

360
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:15,147
MAY I COME IN?

361
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:19,151
JUST LOOKING AROUND,
I'LL GET RIGHT OUT.

362
00:21:19,193 --> 00:21:20,235
I'D BE MUCH OBLIGED.

363
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:22,154
LORENZO, I'M WAITING ON THAT CABBAGE.

364
00:21:22,196 --> 00:21:23,155
OH, BISCUITS!

365
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:25,157
WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE?

366
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:27,659
LOOK LIKE BISCUITS,
GOOD BISCUITS.

367
00:21:29,161 --> 00:21:31,663
TASTE LIKE THAT, TOO.

368
00:21:31,705 --> 00:21:35,667
NOTHING LIKE SOUR MILK AND A BIG OVEN,
IS THERE, JEFF?

369
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:38,670
BAKING SODA WENT IN FIRST-
YOU CAN TELL THAT.

370
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:40,672
SHORTENING IN JUST RIGHT TOO...

371
00:21:40,714 --> 00:21:42,174
AND DOUGH ROLLED
JUST ENOUGH.

372
00:21:42,674 --> 00:21:45,177
JEFF, HOW WOULD
YOU LIKE TO HAVE A DOLLAR

373
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:46,678
FOR EVERY BISCUIT
YOU'VE MADE?

374
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,181
I'D TAKE A NICKELOF GRASS
AND I'D OWN THE PLACE.

375
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:50,265
NOT THAT I'D WANT TO.

376
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:52,184
NOT ANYMORE. NOT NOW.
IT'S TOO CROWDED.

377
00:21:52,684 --> 00:21:54,686
A MAN NEEDS ELBOW ROOM.

378
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:58,190
I WON'T EVEN COME INSIDE YOUR
KITCHEN UNTIL YOU ASK ME TO,

379
00:21:58,232 --> 00:21:59,691
HONESTLY, I WON'T.

380
00:22:05,197 --> 00:22:08,200
SHE ATE ONE. SHE KNEW
WHAT SHE WAS EATING.

381
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:12,704
TOUGHER THAN WHANG LEATHER.

382
00:22:12,746 --> 00:22:15,707
SHE CAN LIE FASTER
THAN A DOG CAN TROT.

383
00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:29,221
WAIT! WAS YOU
BRUNG UP IN A BARN?

384
00:22:29,721 --> 00:22:32,224
NOW, LISTEN, I DON'T WANT
NO REACHING,

385
00:22:32,224 --> 00:22:35,227
NOR EATING WITH KNIFES
NOR DRINKING OUT OF SAUCERS.

386
00:22:35,227 --> 00:22:36,728
THIS HERE WOMAN'S
A LADY.

387
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:40,691
I'M SCARED.

388
00:22:41,191 --> 00:22:42,192
YOU'RE SCARED?

389
00:22:42,234 --> 00:22:44,695
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE BOYS ARE? COME ON.

390
00:22:48,198 --> 00:22:49,199
UP!

391
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:52,202
LUTIE, THESE ARE THE BOYS.

392
00:22:52,244 --> 00:22:53,704
BOYS, THIS IS
MRS. BREWTON.

393
00:22:53,745 --> 00:22:54,705
HOWDY, MA'AM.

394
00:22:54,746 --> 00:22:56,206
I'M VERY GLAD TO MEET YOU.

395
00:22:56,707 --> 00:22:57,708
THERE.

396
00:23:00,711 --> 00:23:01,712
SIT!

397
00:23:14,725 --> 00:23:16,727
THAT'S YOUR PIECE
RIGHT THERE.

398
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:31,760
MA'AM...

399
00:24:31,802 --> 00:24:32,761
YES, BANTY?

400
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:35,764
MRS. BREWTON,
THE BOYS...

401
00:24:35,806 --> 00:24:37,265
WE'VE BEEN
THINKING,

402
00:24:37,307 --> 00:24:40,769
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU WANT
THAT WE CAN DO,

403
00:24:40,811 --> 00:24:43,772
WELL, WE'D ALL-FIRED GLAD TO.

404
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:46,775
WELL, UM.. THANK YOU, BANTY.
THAT'S NICE.

405
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:48,777
ANYTHING, MA'AM.

406
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:52,280
WELL, I, UH... LET'S SEE...

407
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:55,283
OH. YOU KNOW THOSE TREES
DOWN BY THE BROOK?

408
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:56,284
BROOK?

409
00:24:56,326 --> 00:24:57,786
CREEK.
- CREEK? CREEK.

410
00:24:57,828 --> 00:25:00,789
I WONDER IF YOU COULD
PULL THEM OUT FOR ME.

411
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:01,790
WHY, SURE, MA'AM,

412
00:25:01,832 --> 00:25:02,791
IF THEY'RE
BOTHERING YOU ANY

413
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,292
WE CAN THROW A ROPE
AROUND 'EM

414
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:05,794
AND YANK 'EM OUT
BY THE ROOTS.

415
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:07,796
OH, NO. NO, I MEANT
COULD YOU DIG THEM UP

416
00:25:07,838 --> 00:25:08,797
AND PLANT THEM AROUND THE HOUSE

417
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,298
SO THAT WE COULD
HAVE SOME SHADE?

418
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,801
IT WOULD BE LOVELY TO FENCE IN
THE WHOLE YARD.

419
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:14,302
FENCE?

420
00:25:23,311 --> 00:25:24,813
WE'LL DO IT,
MRS. BREWTON-

421
00:25:24,854 --> 00:25:26,815
ALL THE ORNERY
TREES YOU WANT.

422
00:25:26,856 --> 00:25:28,316
WE'LL DO IT.
WON'T WE, BOYS?

423
00:25:28,358 --> 00:25:30,819
UH, SURE WILL.

424
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,321
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

425
00:25:33,822 --> 00:25:34,823
GOOD NIGHT, MRS. BREWTON.

426
00:25:34,864 --> 00:25:36,324
GOOD NIGHT.

427
00:25:37,826 --> 00:25:38,827
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

428
00:25:39,327 --> 00:25:40,328
NO, NO, NO.

429
00:25:40,829 --> 00:25:43,331
YOU SAID "FENCE. THAT'S A CUSSWORD
ON THE OPEN RANGE.

430
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:44,833
OH, MY!

431
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:48,336
COLONEL, I JUST BEEN DOWN
AT THE BARN.

432
00:25:48,378 --> 00:25:50,839
PETE SAYS THAT NEW BULL'S BEEN
FIGHTING AGAIN.

433
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,340
- OH?
CUT UP PRETTY BAD.

434
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,842
OH, I'LL GO
RIGHT DOWN.

435
00:25:53,842 --> 00:25:55,343
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
WON'T YOU?

436
00:25:55,343 --> 00:25:57,345
I CAN'T TAKE A CHANCE ON
THAT NEW BULL.

437
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:06,813
JEFF, JUST HOW
IMPORTANT IS A BULL?

438
00:26:06,855 --> 00:26:09,316
WELL, THIS ONE
IS SURE A BEAUTY.

439
00:26:11,818 --> 00:26:12,819
THERE'S A NEIGHBOR.

440
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:13,820
HUH? WHERE?

441
00:26:13,862 --> 00:26:14,821
THERE.

442
00:26:14,863 --> 00:26:17,824
OH, THAT'S JUST
HEADQUARTERS CAMP.

443
00:26:18,325 --> 00:26:19,826
OH.

444
00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:21,328
WE GOT A NEIGHBOR,
THOUGH.

445
00:26:21,828 --> 00:26:24,331
MCGEE RANCH, LAYS RIGHT OVER
ABOUT 15 MILES.

446
00:26:24,372 --> 00:26:26,333
15 MILES?

447
00:26:27,876 --> 00:26:29,836
IS THERE A MRS. MCGEE?

448
00:26:29,878 --> 00:26:31,838
NO. MCGEE'S
AN OLD BACH.

449
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,340
OH.

450
00:26:33,381 --> 00:26:36,343
WELL...
GOOD NIGHT, JEFF.

451
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,861
LUTIE.

452
00:26:54,903 --> 00:26:56,363
YES, JIM?

453
00:26:59,366 --> 00:27:00,867
HAVE YOU BEEN CRYING?

454
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:02,368
NO.

455
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,870
HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING LIKE CRYING?

456
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,371
NO, JIM.

457
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:07,874
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN FEELING?

458
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:11,377
OH, I'VE BEEN...
JUST THINKING.

459
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:13,379
WHAT ABOUT?

460
00:27:13,421 --> 00:27:16,883
OH, ABOUT... ABOUT ALL THE THINGS
I'M GOING TO DO

461
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:19,385
HOW I'M GOING TO
FIX UP THE HOUSE.

462
00:27:19,427 --> 00:27:21,888
I'LL GET YOU EVERYTHING
YOU NEED, LUTIE.

463
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:24,891
YOU'RE SURE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

464
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:26,392
VERY SURE.

465
00:27:26,434 --> 00:27:27,894
LUTIE...

466
00:27:27,936 --> 00:27:29,896
ONLY...
- ONLY WHAT?

467
00:27:29,938 --> 00:27:32,398
ONE THING:

468
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:34,234
I WISH YOU LOOKED AT ME

469
00:27:34,234 --> 00:27:36,903
THE WAY YOU LOOK AT THAT OUT THERE.

470
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,412
CUT ALL THEM COPPERWOODS
OUT OF THE HERD FIRST

471
00:27:46,412 --> 00:27:49,082
MRS. BREWTON DON'T WANT NO
MIXED BREEDS AT THIS END OF THE RANGE.

472
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:49,916
JUST YEW AND TAMARIND.

473
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:51,376
HEY, THIS HERE'S A MAVERICK,
AIN'T IT?

474
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:53,878
SURE 'TIS. BRAND HER
AND LET HER GO.

475
00:27:54,379 --> 00:27:56,381
COMMENCE PLANTING THEM NOW,
CLEAR AROUND THE HOUSE.

476
00:27:56,422 --> 00:27:57,882
YEAH, LIKE A FENCE!

477
00:28:00,885 --> 00:28:03,388
PAT THE DIRT UP NICE
AROUND THEM ROOTS.

478
00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:04,889
THEY'RE KIND OF SPINDLY.

479
00:28:04,931 --> 00:28:06,391
I'M AFRAID THE FIRST
GOOD WIND

480
00:28:06,432 --> 00:28:08,393
WILL KNOCK 'EM FLATTER
THAN A FLITTER.

481
00:28:08,434 --> 00:28:10,895
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT
THEM LITTLE TREES.

482
00:28:10,937 --> 00:28:12,397
THEY'RE SKINNY,
BUT THEY'RE AWFUL STUBBORN.

483
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:34,127
THANK YOU, BANTY.

484
00:28:43,428 --> 00:28:46,431
I SAW SELINA HALL
IN TOWN YESTERDAY.

485
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:53,438
SHE'S STILL LIVING IN THAT LEAN-TO
BEHIND THE SALOON.

486
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:55,940
SHOULD'VE LEFT WHEN
THE OTHER SQUATTERS DID.

487
00:28:55,982 --> 00:28:58,943
SHE'S TAKING IN WASHING NOW.

488
00:28:58,985 --> 00:29:01,446
THE WATER'S LIKE LYE
HER HANDS WERE BLEEDING.

489
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:03,448
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HER MAN?

490
00:29:03,489 --> 00:29:06,951
THERE ARE PLENTY OF JOBS IN SALT FORK
IF A MAN WANTS TO WORK.

491
00:29:06,993 --> 00:29:08,953
OH, HE'S WORKING
IN THE SALOON.

492
00:29:08,995 --> 00:29:10,955
HE SMELLS EXACTLY
LIKE BEER.

493
00:29:14,459 --> 00:29:17,462
JIM, SAM HALL'S A FARMER.

494
00:29:17,503 --> 00:29:19,964
HE'S NOT A MAN TO BE
SMELLING OF BEER.

495
00:29:19,964 --> 00:29:23,968
AND SELINA HAS TO CARRY ALL
THE WATER SHE USES FOR BLOCKS.

496
00:29:23,968 --> 00:29:26,971
WELL, YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO FIND
MUCH WATER AROUND A SALOON.

497
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:28,473
OH, JIM.

498
00:29:32,977 --> 00:29:34,937
SHE'S HAVING ANOTHER ONE,
YOU KNOW.

499
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:35,938
HUSBAND?

500
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,440
BABY.

501
00:29:37,482 --> 00:29:39,442
OH.

502
00:29:39,484 --> 00:29:42,945
SHE CAN'T HAVE IT IN THAT LEAN-TO
BEHIND THE SALOON.

503
00:29:44,447 --> 00:29:46,949
SELINA SAYS THEY'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT FILING

504
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:49,452
ON A SPOT NEAR
MULE CREEK FLAT.

505
00:29:49,494 --> 00:29:52,455
RIGHT SMACK IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY HEADQUARTERS RANGE.

506
00:29:52,497 --> 00:29:54,957
YES. NICE AND CLOSE
TO US, ISN'T?

507
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:56,959
WHAT IS NICE ABOUT
BEING CLOSE?

508
00:29:57,001 --> 00:29:59,462
JIM, SELINA'S MY FRIEND.

509
00:29:59,504 --> 00:30:00,963
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
I'VE GOT OUT HERE.

510
00:30:01,464 --> 00:30:02,465
SHE'D BE A NEIGHBOR.

511
00:30:02,507 --> 00:30:04,967
YOUR WORK TAKES YOU AWAY
SO MUCH.

512
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:06,469
I'M NOT COMPLAINING, DARLING.

513
00:30:06,511 --> 00:30:08,471
BUT SHE'D BE SOMEONE
TO TALK TO.

514
00:30:08,513 --> 00:30:10,473
WOMEN LIKE
TO TALK A LOT.

515
00:30:10,515 --> 00:30:12,475
YES, I KNOW.

516
00:30:14,977 --> 00:30:16,479
NO, THANKS.

517
00:30:19,982 --> 00:30:22,485
THEY COULD BE SETTLED
BEFORE THE BABY COMES.

518
00:30:22,527 --> 00:30:24,487
THAT'LL BE IN APRIL.

519
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,492
I'LL HAVE MINE IN MAY.

520
00:30:30,993 --> 00:30:32,495
YOU'LL WHAT?

521
00:30:32,995 --> 00:30:34,497
HAVE YOU SEEN DOC REID?

522
00:30:34,997 --> 00:30:35,998
MM-HMM.

523
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,999
LUTIE!

524
00:30:43,005 --> 00:30:45,007
GOOD GIRL, LUTIE

525
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:47,510
GOOD BOY, JIM.

526
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,512
SELINA SAYS SHE WANTS A BOY.

527
00:30:49,554 --> 00:30:53,516
I'LL BUY YOU A WHOLE FLOOR OF THE BEST
HOSPITAL IN DENVER.

528
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:56,018
WHAT FOR? HOME'S THE PLACE
TO HAVE A BABY.

529
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,020
WONDER WHERE SELINA
WILL HAVE HERS.

530
00:30:58,521 --> 00:31:00,523
OUT UNDER A BUSH SOMEWHERE,
I SUPPOSE.

531
00:31:00,523 --> 00:31:04,026
I HAVE A HUNCH IT'S GOING
TO BE SOMEWHERE ON MULE CREEK FLAT.

532
00:31:04,026 --> 00:31:07,530
OH, JIM! YOU'LL LIKE THE HALLS
WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW THEM.

533
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,031
I DON'T EXPECT TO GET TO
KNOW THEM.

534
00:31:09,031 --> 00:31:10,032
WHY?

535
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:12,034
I DON'T THINK THEY'LL
BE HERE LONG ENOUGH.

536
00:31:12,034 --> 00:31:13,536
DON'T BE CRUEL, JIM.

537
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:16,038
I WON'T HAVE TO. THE COUNTRY HERE
TAKES CARE OF ITSELF, LUTIE.

538
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:18,040
I DON'T KNOW JUST HOW
IT WILL HAPPEN,

539
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,001
BUT I'LL GIVE THEM
ABOUT 6 MONTHS.

540
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:22,003
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
FIND OUT ALL THAT

541
00:31:22,044 --> 00:31:23,504
FOR YOURSELF,
AREN'T YOU?

542
00:31:23,546 --> 00:31:25,506
ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.
TELL THEM TO FILE,

543
00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:28,009
AND AS LONG AS THEY'RE HERE,
I'LL BE NICE TO THEM.

544
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:30,511
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH,
COLONEL BREWTON.

545
00:31:30,553 --> 00:31:32,513
KIND OF TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF ME

546
00:31:32,555 --> 00:31:34,515
YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU,
MRS. BREWTON?

547
00:31:34,557 --> 00:31:36,517
THAT'S WHAT AN ADVANTAGE IS FOR.

548
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:42,523
THIS KiD BETTER LOOK LIKE YOU,
OR I'LL DROWN IT.

549
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:11,552
HI!

550
00:32:11,594 --> 00:32:14,555
HELLO, SELINA! WHOA.

551
00:32:14,597 --> 00:32:16,557
WE'RE GETTING A SOD HOUSE UP.

552
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:18,559
WHAT A COUNTRY-
MAN NEEDS A HOUSE,

553
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:21,062
HE JUST DIGS IT
OUT OF THE GROUND.

554
00:32:21,103 --> 00:32:23,064
YES, QUITE A COUNTRY
AND GETTING BETTER.

555
00:32:23,105 --> 00:32:24,065
WHY, MR. CHAMBERLAIN.

556
00:32:24,106 --> 00:32:26,067
MRS. BREWTON.

557
00:32:26,108 --> 00:32:28,569
SAY, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU FOLKS
WAS ACQUAINTED.

558
00:32:28,611 --> 00:32:31,572
OH, YES. MR. CHAMBERLAIN
IS AN OLD, OLD FRIEND AND ADVISOR.

559
00:32:32,073 --> 00:32:33,574
DID HE ADVISE YOU TOO, SELINA?

560
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:35,576
SHOWED US HOW TO
FILE ON THIS LAND,

561
00:32:36,077 --> 00:32:37,078
IF YOU CALL THAT ADVISING.

562
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:39,080
I BROUGHT A PRESENT FOR LITTLE MOLLY.

563
00:32:39,121 --> 00:32:41,082
HIS NAME IS
REDEYE SON-OF-A-GUN.

564
00:32:41,123 --> 00:32:43,084
HERE, MOLLY. HERE'S
A PRESENT FOR YOU.

565
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:45,086
I HOPE YOU CAN USE ALL THAT
STUFF, SELINA.

566
00:32:45,586 --> 00:32:47,088
WHY, HONEY, I CAN USE ANYTHING

567
00:32:47,088 --> 00:32:49,090
FROM A BUTTONHOOK TO
A KITCHEN RANGE.

568
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,592
COLONEL BREWTON SENT US OVER
A SIDE OF BEEF.

569
00:32:51,592 --> 00:32:53,594
THIS BUFFALO GRASS SURE
GOES DOWN DEEP.

570
00:32:53,594 --> 00:32:55,096
HELLO, SAM!s

571
00:32:55,096 --> 00:32:59,100
I'D FEEL A LOT EASIER IF YOU'D TAKE
THAT BEEF BACK, MRS. BREWTON.

572
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,559
WE DON'T NEED IT.

573
00:33:00,601 --> 00:33:02,561
SHUT UP SAM,
SURE WE NEED IT.

574
00:33:03,062 --> 00:33:05,064
WELL, MAYBE WE DO-
FOR EATING PURPOSES.

575
00:33:05,106 --> 00:33:08,067
BUT I'D SURE CHOKE ON IT
IF I FIGURED TAKING IT

576
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:09,568
GAVE ANYBODY
ANY WRONG IDEAS.

577
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:12,071
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE
GOT A RIGHT TO BE HERE.

578
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:14,573
NOBODY'S LETTING US
DO ANYTHING.

579
00:33:14,615 --> 00:33:17,076
WE'RE JUST DOING IT AND
WE CAN TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES.

580
00:33:17,118 --> 00:33:19,078
I KNOW THAT, SAM.

581
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,579
YOU WANT LUTIE TO FEEL
SHE AIN'T WELCOME?

582
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:22,581
THAT AIN'T WHAT I MEAN,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

583
00:33:22,623 --> 00:33:25,084
YOU WANT TO COME TO SEE MY WIFE
HERE ON OUR PLACE,

584
00:33:25,126 --> 00:33:26,585
YOU COME, AND MOST WELCOME,
MRS. BREWTON.

585
00:33:26,627 --> 00:33:28,087
THANK YOU, SAM.

586
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:31,590
DON'T TAKE SAM
SERIOUS.

587
00:33:31,632 --> 00:33:33,092
HE'S JUST BEING A MAN.

588
00:33:33,592 --> 00:33:35,094
I KNOW. THEY'RE RATHER PECULIAR PEOPLE

589
00:33:35,136 --> 00:33:36,095
SOMETIMES, AREN'T THEY?

590
00:33:36,137 --> 00:33:37,596
SOMETIMES?!

591
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,102
YOU KNOW, I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY.

592
00:33:43,144 --> 00:33:44,603
WHEN YOU FIRST DROVE UP TODAY,
I THOUGHT

593
00:33:45,104 --> 00:33:46,605
"HERE COMES
LADY BOUNTIFUL."

594
00:33:46,647 --> 00:33:49,608
I TAKE IT BACK. YOU'RE REALLY
FOND OF SAM AND SELINA HALL.

595
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:52,111
SELINA WAS MY FIRST FRIEND OUT HERE.

596
00:33:52,153 --> 00:33:53,612
I'M AWFULLY GLAD SHE DOESN'T
SEEM LONELY.

597
00:33:54,113 --> 00:33:55,614
DID YOU EXPECT HER TO BE?

598
00:33:55,656 --> 00:33:57,616
WELL, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR IT.

599
00:33:58,117 --> 00:33:59,118
HARDLY A WOMAN'COUNTRY.

600
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,619
IT COULD BE.

601
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:02,621
IT SHOULD BE,
AND SOMEDAY IT WILL.

602
00:34:02,663 --> 00:34:04,623
WHEN? HOW?

603
00:34:04,665 --> 00:34:07,126
WHY NOT? IT'S HAPPENED
IN OTHER PLACES.

604
00:34:07,168 --> 00:34:09,628
FIRST THE COVERED WAGONS,
THEN THE HOUSES,

605
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,630
THEN THE FARMS-FAMILIES,
CHILDREN GROWING UP.

606
00:34:11,672 --> 00:34:14,633
SURE, IT WILL BE A WOMAN'S COUNTRY THEN.

607
00:34:14,675 --> 00:34:16,635
WOMEN WILL HELP
MAKE IT THEIRS.

608
00:34:16,677 --> 00:34:19,138
DO YOU HEAR THAT,
MR. CHAMBERLAIN?

609
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,139
THE HEAR IT?

610
00:34:20,181 --> 00:34:22,141
THE PEOPLE, I MEAN,
OUT THERE.

611
00:34:22,183 --> 00:34:24,143
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF
SELINAS AND SAMS

612
00:34:24,185 --> 00:34:25,644
REALLY, ISN'T IT?

613
00:34:25,644 --> 00:34:27,146
COLONEL BREWTON HEARS SOMETHING
SO DIFFERENT.

614
00:34:27,646 --> 00:34:30,149
I'M AFRAID YOU'VE GOT ME WRONG.
I DON'T HEAR ANY VOICES.

615
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:33,152
I ONLY KNOW THIS IS GOOD LAND
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING

616
00:34:33,152 --> 00:34:35,154
UNLESS PEOPLE GET
THEIR LIVING OUT IT.

617
00:34:35,154 --> 00:34:36,655
USE IT, LIVE ON IT.

618
00:34:36,655 --> 00:34:40,159
THAT'S WHERE I COME IN.
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS.

619
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,161
ANYWAY, I'LL MAKE
A STAB AT IT.

620
00:34:43,662 --> 00:34:45,164
I TURN BACK HERE.

621
00:34:45,164 --> 00:34:47,625
MAYBE THEN, THIS WOULD BE
MY COUNTRY TOO.

622
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,131
AND YOU-
WHAT DO YOU HEAR?

623
00:34:54,173 --> 00:34:56,133
I'VE BEEN TOLD
THAT A GOOD WIFE

624
00:34:56,175 --> 00:34:58,636
HEARS ONLY WHAT HER HUSBAND
WANTS HER TO HEAR.

625
00:34:58,677 --> 00:35:01,138
WELL, WHAT AN OLD-FASHIONED IDEA.

626
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,140
DON'T BE UNFAIR,
MR. CHAMBERLAIN.

627
00:35:03,182 --> 00:35:05,142
YOU MUST ADMIT THAT
COLONEL BREWTON'S

628
00:35:05,184 --> 00:35:07,645
MADE IT EASY
FOR SELINA AND SAM.

629
00:35:07,686 --> 00:35:10,147
ONE SIDE OF BEEF?
CONSCIENCE MONEY.

630
00:35:10,189 --> 00:35:11,649
YOU ARE UNFAIR.

631
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,151
I'M REALISTIC. DON'T FORGET
IT'S ONLY ONE SAM, ONE SELINA

632
00:35:14,193 --> 00:35:16,153
AND ONE SIDE OF BEEF.

633
00:35:16,654 --> 00:35:18,656
YOU SPEAK OF THOUSANDS.

634
00:35:19,156 --> 00:35:21,659
I'M WONDERING WHY
BREWTON EVEN HELPED ONE.

635
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,661
HE'S A PIRATE, YOU KNOW.

636
00:35:23,702 --> 00:35:26,664
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM,
THAT'S ALL. I DO.

637
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:31,168
WHY DO WOMEN INSIST ON LOVING MEN

638
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,171
FOR WHAT THEY WANT THEM TO BE
INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY ARE?

639
00:35:34,213 --> 00:35:35,673
GOOD DAY, MR. CHAMBERLAIN.

640
00:35:36,674 --> 00:35:38,676
YOU KNOW, I ENVY BREWTON
VERY MUCH.

641
00:35:39,176 --> 00:35:41,178
YOU MEAN, YOU ENVY
THE PIRATE HIS LOOT?

642
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:43,180
NOT ALL OF IT.
JUST ONE THING.

643
00:35:43,222 --> 00:35:45,683
I'LL GET AROUND TO TELLING YOU
WHAT IT IS SOME DAY.

644
00:35:46,183 --> 00:35:48,185
COME NOW, MR. CHAMBERLAIN,
I'M NOT A CHILD.

645
00:35:48,227 --> 00:35:49,687
I DISLIKE THIS
SCURRYING ABOUT.

646
00:35:49,728 --> 00:35:53,691
IF YOU THINK I'M ATTRACTIVE, WHY DON'T
YOU SAY SO AND GET IT OVER WITH.

647
00:35:53,732 --> 00:35:55,693
THAT ISN'T WHAT I MEANT,
BUT NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT

648
00:35:55,734 --> 00:35:57,695
YOU ARE ATTRACTIVE.

649
00:35:57,736 --> 00:35:58,696
YOU'RE VERYATTRACTIVE.

650
00:35:58,737 --> 00:36:00,698
I KNOW IT, AND YOU KNOW
I KNOW IT.

651
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:02,700
YOU'VE KNOWN IT
SINCE THE FIRST TIME I LOOKED AT YOU.

652
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,703
YES, I-I HAVE MR. CHAMBERLAIN.

653
00:36:05,744 --> 00:36:09,206
AND NOW YOU'VE SAID IT
AND WE'RE DONE WITH IT.

654
00:36:09,248 --> 00:36:12,710
ARE WE?
I DON'T THINK SO.

655
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:54,710
THE COMPANY'S ALL HERE.

656
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:55,711
AIN'T THAT BABY ASLEEP YET?

657
00:36:55,752 --> 00:36:57,212
NOW, YOU GO ON AND GET OUT OF HERE

658
00:36:57,713 --> 00:36:58,714
YOU'RE KEEPING HER ALL RILED UP.

659
00:36:58,755 --> 00:37:00,215
AND KEEP HER
OUT OF MY WAY TOO

660
00:37:00,257 --> 00:37:02,217
IF YOU WANT ME TO GET
THIS CHILD TO SLEEP.

661
00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:03,218
EVERYTHING READY
DOWNSTAIRS, JEFF?

662
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,720
WELL, OF COURSE IT IS,

663
00:37:04,761 --> 00:37:06,221
ELSE WHY I'VE BEEN OVER THAT STOVE
SINCE DAYLIGHT?

664
00:37:06,722 --> 00:37:07,431
NOW, GO ON, GIT!

665
00:37:07,723 --> 00:37:08,724
GOOD NIGHT, SARAH BETH.

666
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:13,729
YOU TOO. NOW GO ON.
GET OUT OF HERE. VAMOOSE!

667
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:37,753
SURE IS LIGHT-FOOTED, AIN'T HE?

668
00:37:37,794 --> 00:37:39,755
LIGHT-FINGERED, TOO,
IT BEGINS TO LOOK LIKE.

669
00:37:40,255 --> 00:37:42,758
GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU
THE LADY FROM ST. LOUIS.

670
00:37:42,799 --> 00:37:45,260
A GOOD TOAST TO REMEMBER
IN THIS HOUSE.

671
00:37:45,302 --> 00:37:46,762
DRINK HEARTY, GENTLEMEN.

672
00:38:09,743 --> 00:38:12,287
I KNOW YOU OF OLD

673
00:38:12,287 --> 00:38:17,250
YOU ROBBED MY POOR FATHER
OF SILVER AND GOLD.

674
00:38:17,751 --> 00:38:19,753
OH, WHISKEY, RYE WHISKEY...

675
00:38:19,795 --> 00:38:20,754
WHAT ARE YOU SINGING?

676
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:23,757
IT'S A LULLABY, AND IT WON'T DO
MUCH LULLING

677
00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:26,259
IF YOU PEOPLE KEEP COMING IN HERE
AND STOMPING AROUND.

678
00:38:26,301 --> 00:38:27,761
HOW DO I LOOK, JEFF?

679
00:38:27,803 --> 00:38:29,763
REAL PRETTY.

680
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:32,265
GO TO SLEEP, BABY...

681
00:38:32,307 --> 00:38:34,267
JEFF, DO YOU EVER GET TIRED

682
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:36,269
OF COOKING FOR ALL
THESE PARTIES?

683
00:38:36,311 --> 00:38:39,773
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT IF
I WAS YOU, COLONEL.

684
00:38:39,815 --> 00:38:42,776
WOMEN GOT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF
PARTIES IN THEIR SYSTEM,

685
00:38:42,818 --> 00:38:45,278
AND THEY JUST GOT
TO GET 'EM OUT.

686
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:52,285
GO TO SLEEP BABY...
GO TO SLEEP NOW.

687
00:38:52,327 --> 00:38:53,787
JEFF, YOU'RE A WONDERFUL MOTHER.

688
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:00,293
YOU KNOW, BEING STIRRED UP
MUST BE GOOD FOR YOU, LUTIE.

689
00:39:00,335 --> 00:39:03,296
BEEN MARRIED A WHOLE YEAR
AND STILL DON'T LOOK LIKE A WIFE.

690
00:39:03,338 --> 00:39:04,798
STOP IT, BRICE.

691
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,800
WHAT KEEPS YOU
SO STIRRED UP, LUTIE?

692
00:39:12,806 --> 00:39:15,308
YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING
YOU WANT, HAVEN'T YOU?

693
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,310
STOP IT.
STOP IT, BRICE.

694
00:39:17,352 --> 00:39:19,312
YOU CAN STOP ME EASY.

695
00:39:19,354 --> 00:39:21,314
JUST TELL ME YOU'VE GOT
EVERYTHING YOU WANT.

696
00:39:21,356 --> 00:39:24,317
TELL ME YOU'VE GOT EVEN PART
OF WHAT YOU WANT.

697
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:26,319
OH, COME ON, LUTIE,
WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER ME?

698
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,322
I'LL TELL YOU WHY- BECAUSE YOU
DON'T LIE VERY WELL.

699
00:39:29,364 --> 00:39:31,825
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY
THAT YOU'RE NOT AFRAID TO SAY.

700
00:39:42,836 --> 00:39:44,838
JUST WHITE SAND,
JUST AS SOFT AS-

701
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:47,340
HELLO, NICK.
DANCE WITH ME, JIM.

702
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,842
WHAT'S THE MATTER, LUTIE?

703
00:39:48,842 --> 00:39:51,344
NOTHING. THIS IS YOUR DANCE,
THAT'S ALL.

704
00:39:51,344 --> 00:39:52,345
PLEASE.

705
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:32,344
MADE YOU SOME TEA.

706
00:40:32,385 --> 00:40:33,345
THANK YOU, JEFF.

707
00:40:33,386 --> 00:40:36,348
MAYBE IT WILL WARM ME
UP A LITTLE.

708
00:40:36,389 --> 00:40:37,849
A REAL HEAVY SNOWFALL.

709
00:40:37,891 --> 00:40:39,351
SNOWFALL? IT'S A BLIZZARD.

710
00:40:41,353 --> 00:40:43,855
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
THE COLONEL, JEFF.

711
00:40:43,897 --> 00:40:46,358
HE HASN'T BEEN HOME FOR 48 HOURS.

712
00:40:46,399 --> 00:40:49,361
OH, I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.
HE'S ALL RIGHT.

713
00:40:49,402 --> 00:40:51,863
HE'S ALWAYS ALL RIGHT.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE CATTLE.

714
00:41:17,389 --> 00:41:19,891
HEY, KEEP THEM AWAY FROM
THAT BARBED WIRE!

715
00:41:19,891 --> 00:41:21,393
HEAD 'EM OFF!

716
00:41:21,393 --> 00:41:23,895
FENCE! KEEP 'EM OUT
OF THE HALLS'

717
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:25,397
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, SAM?

718
00:41:25,397 --> 00:41:27,399
I TOLD BREWTON'S MEN THE NEXT STEER
THAT BUSTED DOWN MY FENCE

719
00:41:27,899 --> 00:41:28,900
WAS GONNA GET BLOWN
TO PIECES.

720
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,901
BUT, SAM, THEM CATTLE
DON'T KNOW WHERE

721
00:41:30,402 --> 00:41:31,277
THEY'RE DRIFTING IN THIS STORM.

722
00:41:31,403 --> 00:41:32,404
MAYBE THEY'LL HEAD
THE OTHER WAY.

723
00:41:32,904 --> 00:41:34,906
DON'T GO OUT THERE, SAM.
IT'S ONLY LOOKING FOR TROUBLE.

724
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:35,907
TROUBLE? IT WAS
TROUBLE LAST SUMMER

725
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:37,409
WHEN THEM CATTLE
TROMPLED OUR RYE CROP

726
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:38,868
BEFORE WE COULD HARVEST IT,
WASN'T IT?

727
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,370
I GOT FALL WHEAT PLANTED
OUT THERE

728
00:41:40,412 --> 00:41:42,872
AND I AIN'T GONNA STAND BY
AND SEE IT GET RUINED!

729
00:41:42,914 --> 00:41:44,374
SELINA, WITH THE NEW BABY COMING

730
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:46,376
IF WE DON'T MAKE THIS CROP
WE GOT TO GIVE UP.

731
00:41:46,876 --> 00:41:47,877
NO, SAM! DON'T!

732
00:41:48,378 --> 00:41:50,380
SAM, STAY HERE!

733
00:41:50,422 --> 00:41:54,384
SAM! COME BACK! SAM!

734
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,892
KEEP THEM CATTLE
OUT OF MY WHEAT!

735
00:42:05,395 --> 00:42:07,397
GET 'EM OUT OF THERE!

736
00:42:13,903 --> 00:42:15,405
SAM, LOOK OUT!

737
00:42:24,914 --> 00:42:27,417
COME ON, LET'S GET HIM!
KILL THAT YELLOWBELLY!

738
00:42:47,437 --> 00:42:48,438
SAM!

739
00:42:51,441 --> 00:42:53,943
SAM. SAM...

740
00:43:02,452 --> 00:43:04,454
SAM.

741
00:43:24,432 --> 00:43:26,935
SAM. SAM!

742
00:43:26,976 --> 00:43:28,937
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
SELINA.

743
00:43:48,456 --> 00:43:50,458
JEFF, JEFF!

744
00:43:54,963 --> 00:43:55,964
IS JIM BACK?

745
00:43:56,464 --> 00:43:58,967
NO, MRS. BREWTON,
THE COLONEL AIN'T HOME YET.

746
00:43:59,008 --> 00:44:00,468
WELL, THEN WHAT'S HAPPENED, JEFF?

747
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,970
SOME OF THE BOYS
JUST GOT IN.

748
00:44:02,011 --> 00:44:02,971
I HEATED UP SOME COFFEE.

749
00:44:03,471 --> 00:44:04,973
NOW, YOU GET BACK TO BED. IT'S COLD.

750
00:44:05,473 --> 00:44:07,976
NO, I'M NOT GOING BACK TO BED
UNTIL YOU TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENED.

751
00:44:08,017 --> 00:44:09,978
IT WAS NOTHING MUCH.
A LITTLE BLOWUP OVER AT HALLS.

752
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:10,979
HALL SHOT ONE OF OUR STEERS,

753
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,981
AND THE BOYS KIND OF WORKED HIM
OVER. NOW GIT.

754
00:44:13,022 --> 00:44:14,482
WORKED HIM OVER BAD?

755
00:44:14,983 --> 00:44:15,984
WELL, THE BOYS SAID "GOOD."

756
00:44:16,484 --> 00:44:17,986
I'M GOING OVER TO THE HALLS.

757
00:44:18,027 --> 00:44:19,988
YOU AIN'T GOING NOWHERE.
THERE'S DRIFTS.

758
00:44:20,029 --> 00:44:21,990
YOU GET ME A HORSE.
SELINA'S EXPECTING ANOTHER BABY

759
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:24,492
I'M GOING TO SEE
IF SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

760
00:44:24,534 --> 00:44:25,994
WELL, WRAP UP WARM.

761
00:44:56,024 --> 00:44:59,027
SAM! I'VE COME
TO SEE SELINA.

762
00:45:01,029 --> 00:45:02,530
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

763
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:03,990
LET ME IN, SAM.

764
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:05,533
NO.

765
00:45:05,533 --> 00:45:06,993
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

766
00:45:07,035 --> 00:45:09,495
SHE TRIED TO HELP ME.
THE BABY'S DEAD.

767
00:45:09,537 --> 00:45:10,496
NO, SAM...

768
00:45:10,997 --> 00:45:12,498
MAKE HER GO AWAY, SAM.

769
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,501
I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN.
SEND HER AWAY!

770
00:45:15,543 --> 00:45:16,502
SELINA-

771
00:45:16,544 --> 00:45:17,503
YOU HEARD WHAT SHE SAID.

772
00:45:18,004 --> 00:45:19,005
NOW, GO ON BACK TO BREWTON.

773
00:45:19,505 --> 00:45:21,507
TELL HIM HE'S WON.
TELL HIM HES WON A BIG VICTORY.

774
00:45:22,008 --> 00:45:23,009
WE LEAVE NOW.

775
00:45:23,051 --> 00:45:25,011
NOW GO ON. GET OUT.

776
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,042
WHOA.

777
00:46:02,048 --> 00:46:03,549
GOOD. LOOK AFTER HIM

778
00:46:03,591 --> 00:46:05,051
SURE, COLONEL.

779
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:24,070
LUTIE, I HEARD
ABOUT THE HALLS.

780
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:25,571
YES.

781
00:46:25,613 --> 00:46:27,573
IT WAS A BAD NIGHT
ALL AROUND.

782
00:46:28,074 --> 00:46:29,575
I LOST A COUPLE
OF HUNDRED HEAD.

783
00:46:29,617 --> 00:46:31,077
SORRY, JIM.

784
00:46:31,118 --> 00:46:34,080
WELL, IT'S NICE TO HOME
AGAIN WITH YOU.

785
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,582
JIM, SELINA'S BABY
IS DEAD.

786
00:46:38,084 --> 00:46:40,086
I KNOW. TOO BAD.

787
00:46:41,087 --> 00:46:43,089
JIM...

788
00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:46,050
JIM, SHE'S SO BITTER
AND SO LOST.

789
00:46:46,092 --> 00:46:49,053
WE'VE GOT TO LET HER
KNOW HOW SORRY WE ARE.

790
00:46:49,554 --> 00:46:51,055
WE'VE GOT TO HELP THEM.

791
00:46:51,097 --> 00:46:55,059
THE BEST WAY TO HELP THEM
IS TO STAY AWAY FROM THEM.

792
00:46:55,101 --> 00:46:58,062
JIM, THEY SAY THEY'RE LEAVING.

793
00:46:58,563 --> 00:46:59,564
LET THEM GO.

794
00:47:03,568 --> 00:47:05,570
I MADE A MISTAKE BEFORE, LUTIE.

795
00:47:05,611 --> 00:47:08,072
I SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN IN TO YOU.
I WON'T AGAIN.

796
00:47:08,114 --> 00:47:11,576
THE TIME I DID THOSE PEOPLE HARM
WAS WHEN LET THEM FILE.

797
00:47:12,076 --> 00:47:13,077
MY FAULT, LUTIE
NOT YOURS.

798
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,079
JIM, IF YOU WON'T
HELP THE HALLS

799
00:47:15,121 --> 00:47:17,081
FOR THEMSELVES,
THEN DO IT FOR ME.

800
00:47:17,123 --> 00:47:19,083
I LOVE SELINA, AND RIGHT
NOW, SHE HATES ME.

801
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:20,584
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO, LUTIE.

802
00:47:20,626 --> 00:47:23,087
THIS WOULD ONLY HAPPEN AGAIN,
OR SOMETHING SIMILAR.

803
00:47:23,129 --> 00:47:25,589
IT FIGURED TO HAPPEN.
THIS TOUGH COUNTRY, LUTIE.

804
00:47:25,631 --> 00:47:27,091
THIS COUNTRY, I'M SICK TO DEATH

805
00:47:27,133 --> 00:47:28,592
OF TALKING ABOUT THIS COUNTRY.

806
00:47:28,634 --> 00:47:30,094
YOU REALLY
THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT

807
00:47:30,136 --> 00:47:31,095
THAN THE PEOPLE IN IT.

808
00:47:31,137 --> 00:47:32,596
WELL, THAT DEPENDS,
IT DEPENDS ON

809
00:47:32,638 --> 00:47:34,598
WHO THE PEOPLE ARE
AND WHAT THEY'RE UP TO.

810
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,600
YOU LET SELINA AND SAM HALL STAY HERE

811
00:47:37,101 --> 00:47:39,103
BECAUSE YOU WANTED SOMETHING
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN-

812
00:47:39,145 --> 00:47:40,604
TO SHOW ME,
TO SHOW EVERYONE

813
00:47:40,646 --> 00:47:42,606
YOU DON'T CARE
HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE.

814
00:47:42,648 --> 00:47:45,609
JUST SO LONG AS YOU KEEP THE GRASS
FOR YOURSELF.

815
00:47:45,651 --> 00:47:46,610
LUTIE...

816
00:47:50,614 --> 00:47:54,618
LUTIE... I'LL TRY TO TELL YOU, LUTIE.

817
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,620
IT'S HARD TO SAY
BUT...

818
00:47:59,123 --> 00:48:01,125
THE HALLS DON'T COUNT
FOR MUCH, LUTIE.

819
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:03,127
NEITHER DO WE.

820
00:48:03,169 --> 00:48:05,129
BUT THAT OUT THERE
DOES...

821
00:48:05,171 --> 00:48:07,631
AND MEN LIKE CHAMBERLAIN,
THEY WANT TO FARM IT.

822
00:48:07,673 --> 00:48:10,634
THEY WANT TO DIG IT UP
AND DRAW THE WATER OUT OF ITS VEINS,

823
00:48:10,676 --> 00:48:12,636
LET THE SUN GET AT IT,
WAY DOWN DEEP.

824
00:48:12,678 --> 00:48:14,638
IT WOULD CURL UP
AND DIE THEN, LUTIE,

825
00:48:14,638 --> 00:48:16,640
IT WOULD BE DEAD,
AND SO WOULD THE WHOLE COUNTRY,

826
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,641
IT WOULD NEVER LIVE AGAIN.

827
00:48:22,646 --> 00:48:26,650
I TRIED TO TELL YOU, LUTIE,
BUT YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT, DID YOU?

828
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,153
WE WON'T ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

829
00:48:29,153 --> 00:48:32,114
THAT'S RIGHT NO TALK, JUST YOU
AND THE GRASS THE OUT THERE.

830
00:48:32,656 --> 00:48:35,117
THAT'S REALLY THE WAY
YOU WANT IT, ISN'T IT?

831
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:39,622
NO, LUTIE. I WANT
YOU WITH IT, TOO.

832
00:48:39,663 --> 00:48:41,624
YOU DON'T NEED ME,
YOU NEVER DID.

833
00:48:41,665 --> 00:48:43,125
LUTIE...

834
00:48:43,626 --> 00:48:45,127
YOU'VE NEVER LIVED WITH ME.

835
00:48:45,169 --> 00:48:47,630
I'VE BEEN HERE.
YOU'VE BEEN OUT THERE.

836
00:48:57,139 --> 00:49:00,643
JIM, I'D LIKE TO GO AWAY.

837
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:02,144
I'VE GOT TO.

838
00:49:04,647 --> 00:49:07,149
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA.

839
00:49:07,191 --> 00:49:09,652
YOU COULD DO A LITTLE
SHOPPING IN DENVER.

840
00:49:11,654 --> 00:49:13,656
SOME THINKING TOO.

841
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:26,669
DENVER PAPER!
ROCKY MOUNTAIN NEWS!

842
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,671
NEWS?

843
00:49:28,712 --> 00:49:30,673
DENVER PAPER?

844
00:49:30,714 --> 00:49:33,175
CALL FOR MR. O'CONNOR!

845
00:49:33,676 --> 00:49:35,678
CALL FOR
MR. O'CONNOR!

846
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:37,680
WELL, SIR, I FIGURE IF WE'RE EVER GOING

847
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,682
TO BREAK THE HOLD
OF THE CATTLEMEN,

848
00:49:39,723 --> 00:49:42,184
WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE SALT FORK
A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT.

849
00:49:42,685 --> 00:49:44,979
AND SEE TO IT THAT AN IMPARTIAL JUDGE
IS APPOINTED. - RIGHT.

850
00:49:45,229 --> 00:49:47,189
HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR STAY
AT THE BROWN PALACE, MRS. BREWTON.

851
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:50,192
THE MARSHALL ALWAYS WINDS UP
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

852
00:49:50,693 --> 00:49:52,695
EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN, ONE MOMENT.

853
00:49:52,736 --> 00:49:54,697
LUTIE! IN DENVEROF ALL PLACES!

854
00:49:54,738 --> 00:49:56,699
BUT NOT FOR LONG.

855
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,702
LONG ENOUGH TO TAKE
PITY ON ME AT DINNER TONIGHT.

856
00:50:00,202 --> 00:50:03,205
I'M AFRAID NOT BRICE,
MY TRAIN GOES IN THE MORNING, VERY EARLY.

857
00:50:03,706 --> 00:50:06,208
THERE'S NO TRAIN LEAVING
FOR SALT FORK IN THE MORNING.

858
00:50:06,208 --> 00:50:08,210
THIS TRAIN GOES TO ST. LOUIS.

859
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:09,712
OH, I'M SORRY, LUTIE.

860
00:50:09,712 --> 00:50:11,213
I UNDERSTAND, OF COURSE

861
00:50:11,714 --> 00:50:13,173
YOU DON'T WANT TO
SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE.

862
00:50:16,677 --> 00:50:18,679
LUTIE...

863
00:50:18,721 --> 00:50:21,181
I HAVE A SLEIGH
WITH A DRIVER.

864
00:50:21,223 --> 00:50:23,684
CONSIDER IT YOURS
IF YOU'D LIKE SOME AIR.

865
00:50:23,726 --> 00:50:26,186
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BRICE.
THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU.

866
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,689
WITHOUT ME, OF COURSE.

867
00:50:30,691 --> 00:50:32,693
CALL FOR ME AT 8:00.

868
00:50:42,703 --> 00:50:45,205
BREWTON'S A BIG MAN,
I'VE NEVER DENIED IT.

869
00:50:45,247 --> 00:50:48,709
BUT, WELL, IT JUST DOESN'T LEAVE
ROOM FOR ANYONE ELSE-

870
00:50:48,751 --> 00:50:50,210
FOR YOU, IN THIS CASE.

871
00:50:50,252 --> 00:50:51,879
I USED TO WONDER HOW LONG

872
00:50:51,879 --> 00:50:54,715
IT WOULD TAKE YOU TO
ADMIT THAT TO YOURSELF.

873
00:50:54,757 --> 00:50:57,217
YOU NEVER REALLY EXPECTED
HIM TO CHANGE, DID YOU?

874
00:50:57,259 --> 00:50:58,344
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

875
00:50:58,344 --> 00:51:01,221
IT WAS REALLY YOUR FAULT.
YOU KNEW IT WAS HOPELESS.

876
00:51:01,263 --> 00:51:03,724
YOU KNEW IT THE FIRST
TIME I SAW YOU.

877
00:51:03,766 --> 00:51:05,726
YOU KNEW IT
IN THE COURTROOM.

878
00:51:06,226 --> 00:51:09,229
IT'S BEEN WRITTEN ALL OVER YOUR FACE
EVERY TIME SINCE THEN.

879
00:51:09,271 --> 00:51:11,231
THE HALLS WERE YOUR FAULT, TOO.

880
00:51:11,273 --> 00:51:14,735
YOU INSISTED ON PLUNKING THEM DOWN
RIGHT IN THE LION'S DEN.

881
00:51:14,777 --> 00:51:18,739
AND SAT AROUND HOPING
NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN.

882
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:21,241
WELL, IT HAPPENED.

883
00:51:21,283 --> 00:51:24,244
IT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN
BREWTON BEING BREWTON.

884
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:34,254
OH, LUTIE, I'M SORRY,
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

885
00:51:34,296 --> 00:51:36,256
I JUST WANT TO CRY,
THAT'S ALL.

886
00:51:36,757 --> 00:51:38,759
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU.

887
00:51:38,801 --> 00:51:41,762
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S FINE,

888
00:51:41,762 --> 00:51:43,764
ONLY, ONLY...

889
00:51:45,265 --> 00:51:47,768
I FEEL THAT IT'S THE FIRST TIME

890
00:51:47,768 --> 00:51:49,770
THAT ANYONE
HAS SPOKEN TO ME

891
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:52,272
IN MONTHS IN MONTHS
IN MONTHS

892
00:51:52,272 --> 00:51:54,775
I MEAN, ABOUT ME.

893
00:51:55,275 --> 00:51:58,779
ANYWAY, WHAT YOU SAY
IS TRUE.

894
00:51:59,238 --> 00:52:01,740
AND I DON'T MIND
LOOKING AT IT AT LAST.

895
00:52:01,782 --> 00:52:03,742
IT DOESN'T LEAVE ME MUCH,

896
00:52:03,784 --> 00:52:06,245
BUT I DON'T MIND
LOOKING AT IT.

897
00:52:06,286 --> 00:52:08,747
IT LEAVES YOU ME,
LUTIE.

898
00:52:26,765 --> 00:52:27,766
COME IN.

899
00:52:32,271 --> 00:52:33,772
COME IN, BRICE.

900
00:52:36,775 --> 00:52:39,278
THE ST. LOUIS TRAIN
LEAVES IN HALF AN HOUR.

901
00:52:39,778 --> 00:52:41,280
I KNOW.

902
00:52:41,321 --> 00:52:44,783
I HAVE A LITTLE MORE
PACKING TO DO.

903
00:52:44,825 --> 00:52:47,786
WHEN PEOPLE PACK,
THEY'RE GOING SOMEWHERE.

904
00:52:48,287 --> 00:52:50,789
WHEN THEY'RE GOING SOMEWHERE,
IT'S BETTER TO KNOW WHERE.

905
00:52:50,831 --> 00:52:52,291
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN, BRICE?

906
00:52:52,332 --> 00:52:54,293
I MEAN, WHAT'S IT
GOING TO BE, LUTIE?

907
00:52:54,793 --> 00:52:56,295
I'LL GIVE YOU TIME.
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU.

908
00:52:56,336 --> 00:52:57,796
I'LL STAND BACK UNTIL YOU SEND
FOR ME

909
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:00,299
OR I'LL TAKE THAT TRAIN
TO ST. LOUIS WITH YOU.

910
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,800
IT WILL BE WHAT YOU WANT,
LUTIE, WHATEVER IT IS.

911
00:53:01,842 --> 00:53:04,803
IT WILL BE YOUR WAY,
ALL THE WAY.

912
00:53:04,845 --> 00:53:07,306
BRICE...

913
00:53:07,347 --> 00:53:09,808
I'M SO ASHAMED...

914
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:12,811
AND SO SORRY.

915
00:53:12,853 --> 00:53:16,815
ASHAMED FOR ME,
SORRY FOR YOU.

916
00:53:16,857 --> 00:53:18,317
AND JIM.

917
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:19,818
BREWTON'S ALL RIGHT.

918
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,321
HE'S GOT YOU NOW
AS HE NEVER HAD YOU BEFORE.

919
00:53:22,821 --> 00:53:23,822
NO, BRICE.

920
00:53:23,864 --> 00:53:25,324
YOU'RE HANGING ON TO YOURSELF
RIGHT NOW

921
00:53:25,365 --> 00:53:26,825
TO KEEP FROM RUNNING BACK TO HIM.

922
00:53:26,825 --> 00:53:27,826
NO, BRICE.

923
00:53:27,826 --> 00:53:28,827
AND YOU'RE GOING.
- NO.

924
00:53:28,827 --> 00:53:31,830
YES, YOU ARE. NOTHING ON EARTH
CAN STOP YOU.

925
00:53:32,331 --> 00:53:33,832
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

926
00:53:36,335 --> 00:53:38,837
I KNOW HE WON'T CHANGE.

927
00:53:38,837 --> 00:53:41,798
I KNOW I'LL GO HATING
WHAT HE DOES.

928
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,800
AND IT WILL
ALWAYS HURT ME.

929
00:53:44,301 --> 00:53:47,304
BUT NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES
OR WHAT I THINK...

930
00:53:47,346 --> 00:53:49,806
NO MATTER WHERE I GO...

931
00:53:49,848 --> 00:53:54,811
I'LL KEEP FEELING THAT MOST OF ME
IS THERE WITH HIM.

932
00:53:58,815 --> 00:54:01,318
IT MEANS THAT YOU LOVE HIM.

933
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,819
YES.

934
00:54:05,322 --> 00:54:08,325
AND IF I DO,

935
00:54:08,367 --> 00:54:11,828
THEN I'VE GOT
TO BELIEVE IN HIM...

936
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,830
AND GO ALONG WITH HIM.

937
00:54:15,832 --> 00:54:19,836
I'LL GO BACK. TELL HIM
WHAT I'VE DONE...

938
00:54:19,878 --> 00:54:22,839
IF I HAVE THE COURAGE.

939
00:54:24,341 --> 00:54:26,343
I'M SORRY FOR YOU, LUTIE.

940
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:55,872
I GOT A BIG FIRE IN THE LIVING ROOM,
MRS. BREWTON.

941
00:54:55,914 --> 00:54:57,374
THANK YOU, JEFF.

942
00:54:57,415 --> 00:54:59,376
HAS SARAH BETH BEEN ALL RIGHT?

943
00:54:59,417 --> 00:55:00,877
SHE'S FINER THAN THAN FUZZ.

944
00:55:00,919 --> 00:55:03,880
I GOT A REAL NICE FIRE
DOWNSTAIRS.

945
00:55:06,383 --> 00:55:08,385
ALL RIGHT, JEFF.

946
00:55:29,865 --> 00:55:32,367
COLONEL TRADED JOE NETHERWOOD
OUT OF IT.

947
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:34,870
IT'S THE ONLY PIANO IN
THE TERRITORY.

948
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,371
GAVE HIM HIS BEST WHITEFACE BULL.

949
00:55:39,374 --> 00:55:40,876
GOOD FIRE, AIN'T IT?

950
00:55:41,376 --> 00:55:42,878
YES, JEFF.

951
00:56:08,904 --> 00:56:10,405
THANK YOU, JIM.

952
00:56:10,906 --> 00:56:12,407
JUST A FOOL IDEA I HAD.

953
00:56:12,449 --> 00:56:14,910
KIND OF LIKE
HAVING YOU AROUND.

954
00:56:14,951 --> 00:56:16,411
PLAY ME A TUNE, LUTIE.

955
00:56:16,453 --> 00:56:18,413
SAD MUSIC
OR HAPPY MUSIC?

956
00:56:18,914 --> 00:56:23,919
UP TO YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF TUNE
YOU'VE GOT IN YOUR HEAD.

957
00:56:30,926 --> 00:56:32,427
LIKE IT?

958
00:56:32,469 --> 00:56:35,930
PRETTY. KIND OF
A SURPRISE, THOUGH.

959
00:56:35,972 --> 00:56:37,432
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SAD.

960
00:56:37,474 --> 00:56:40,435
IT WAS SAD WHEN
YOU WENT AWAY.

961
00:56:41,936 --> 00:56:44,439
COME HERE, JIM.

962
00:56:44,481 --> 00:56:47,442
STAND BEHIND ME.

963
00:56:50,945 --> 00:56:53,948
JIM, WHEN I WENT AWAY,
I DIDN'T INTEND TO COME BACK

964
00:56:53,948 --> 00:56:55,950
EXCEPT TO GET SARAH BETH.

965
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:59,954
I WAS GOING TO ST. LOUIS.

966
00:56:59,954 --> 00:57:02,957
I FELT IT WAS STILL MY TOWN,
THAT I WOULD BE RIGHT THERE.

967
00:57:02,957 --> 00:57:06,461
YEAH. TREES
IN ST. LOUIS.

968
00:57:06,461 --> 00:57:09,923
YES, TREES YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLANT
AND CHERISH AND PROTECT.

969
00:57:11,925 --> 00:57:14,928
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU EVER NOTICED.

970
00:57:14,969 --> 00:57:17,931
WHY DID YOU PLANT
THEM, LUTIE?

971
00:57:17,972 --> 00:57:20,433
WERE THEY TO SHUT SOMETHING OUT
OR TO SHUT YOURSELF IN?

972
00:57:21,476 --> 00:57:25,939
JIM, I WAS JEALOUS-

973
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,441
PLAIN MEAN JEALOUS
OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE GRASS,

974
00:57:28,483 --> 00:57:30,944
AND I TRIED TO FIGHT IT.

975
00:57:30,985 --> 00:57:33,446
YES, WITH THE TREES AND
WITH SELINA AND SAM

976
00:57:33,488 --> 00:57:34,948
AND WITH A LOT
THINGS.

977
00:57:36,449 --> 00:57:39,953
I WON'T FIGHT IT
ANYMORE, JIM.

978
00:57:41,496 --> 00:57:46,459
I'LL KNOW THAT IT'S THERE,
AND I WON'T CRY ABOUT IT.

979
00:57:46,501 --> 00:57:49,879
AND I WON'T
SAY BITTER THINGS,

980
00:57:49,879 --> 00:57:51,965
AND I WON'T RUN AWAY.

981
00:57:53,967 --> 00:57:58,471
I... I'M BACK, JIM,
IF YOU'LL HAVE ME.

982
00:57:59,973 --> 00:58:02,976
I'LL HAVE YOU, LUTIE.

983
00:58:03,017 --> 00:58:06,479
JIM, DON'T YOU WANT TO ASK ME
HOW DENVER WAS?

984
00:58:06,521 --> 00:58:09,983
AH. DENVER'S ALWAYS
DENVER.

985
00:58:10,024 --> 00:58:11,484
BUT, JIM...

986
00:58:15,989 --> 00:58:18,491
I'LL MAKE IT
UP TO YOU, JIM.

987
00:58:19,993 --> 00:58:23,496
WHAT IS THERE TO MAKE UP?
YOU'RE HERE.

988
00:58:30,503 --> 00:58:33,006
THERE'S REALLY NO REASON
TO WORRY, LUTIE.

989
00:58:33,047 --> 00:58:36,009
JUST DO THE WAY YOU DID
WITH SARAH BETH.

990
00:58:36,009 --> 00:58:38,511
I'LL GO TELL
JIM YOU'RE FINE.

991
00:58:39,012 --> 00:58:41,014
YES, DOC, I'M FINE.

992
00:59:05,496 --> 00:59:07,999
WHEN DO YOU KNOW
WHEN IT'S TUNED?

993
00:59:08,499 --> 00:59:09,500
I JUST KNOW.

994
00:59:12,045 --> 00:59:13,504
DOC, WHAT'S HOLDING UP
SCIENCE?

995
00:59:13,546 --> 00:59:15,006
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE
ABLE TO TELL A MAN

996
00:59:15,048 --> 00:59:16,507
WHETHER IT'S A BOY OR A GIRL?

997
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:18,009
WHAT DO YOU WANT, JIM?

998
00:59:18,051 --> 00:59:20,511
WELL, WE GOT A GIRL.
COME ON! CHEER UP, DOC.

999
00:59:43,034 --> 00:59:47,038
JIM, YOU'VE GOT TO REALIZE
LUTIE'S OUT OF HER HEAD,

1000
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,041
BOUND TO SAY THINGS
WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND.

1001
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:53,044
JUST-JUST DON'T
THINK ABOUT IT.

1002
00:59:53,086 --> 00:59:57,048
GO ON DOWNSTAIRS AND LET
JEFF GET YOU A CUP OF COFFEE.

1003
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:59,050
OH, JEFF POUR HIM A CUP
OF COFFEE.

1004
00:59:59,092 --> 01:00:00,051
I GOT A POT
ON THE STOVE.

1005
01:00:00,093 --> 01:00:01,552
AND ME, TOO.

1006
01:00:01,594 --> 01:00:03,054
YOU'D BETTER
COME IN, DOCTOR.

1007
01:00:03,096 --> 01:00:04,055
SHE'S QUIT THAT WILD
TALK AND

1008
01:00:04,097 --> 01:00:05,556
I THINK THE BABY
IS GETTING CLOSE.

1009
01:00:05,598 --> 01:00:08,059
I NEVER HEARD
SUCH CARRYINGS-ON.

1010
01:00:08,101 --> 01:00:09,560
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT SHE SAID-

1011
01:00:10,061 --> 01:00:15,066
MRS. RYAN, NONE OF US HEARD ANYTHING
IN THAT ROOM WORTH REPEATING.

1012
01:00:15,566 --> 01:00:18,069
OF COURSE NOT.
CERTAINLY NOT.

1013
01:00:18,111 --> 01:00:20,071
I HOPE YOU REMEMEBER
THAT, MRS. RYAN.

1014
01:00:37,547 --> 01:00:39,549
WELL, LUTIE,
WE'VE GOT A SON.

1015
01:00:46,556 --> 01:00:48,558
MACK, WANT TO HAVE A SMOKE?

1016
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:50,560
THANKS, JIM. ONLY GET THESE
WHEN I COME HERE.

1017
01:00:50,601 --> 01:00:51,561
DOC?

1018
01:00:51,602 --> 01:00:53,062
NO THANKS, JIM.

1019
01:00:53,104 --> 01:00:54,564
MRS. McCURTIN WAS SAYING
ONLY YESTERDAY, LUTIE,

1020
01:00:54,605 --> 01:00:57,066
BEFORE BROCK WAS BORN
WE USED TO SEE A LOT OF YOU IN TOWN.

1021
01:00:57,108 --> 01:00:59,068
THE PAST YEAR OR SO,
YOU'VE BEEN HOLING UP ON US.

1022
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:00,111
SHE SPENDS TOO MUCH TIME

1023
01:01:00,111 --> 01:01:02,071
WITH THEM CHILDREN,
SHE'S BOUND TO SPOIL THEM.

1024
01:01:02,572 --> 01:01:04,073
SURE BOTH BABIES GOT OVER
THE CROUP RIGHT?

1025
01:01:04,115 --> 01:01:05,575
THEY GOT OVER IT ALL RIGHT,

1026
01:01:05,616 --> 01:01:08,578
NOT ON ACCOUNT OF THAT
MEDICINE YOU GAVE THEM.

1027
01:01:09,078 --> 01:01:10,079
YOU GOING TO TAKE THIS OR
AREN'T YOU?

1028
01:01:10,121 --> 01:01:12,081
THAT SO, JEFF?
WHAT CURED THEM?

1029
01:01:12,123 --> 01:01:14,083
BAKING SODA,
AND LOTS OF IT.

1030
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:18,588
CURE ANY KIND OF A COLD.
DOCTORS!

1031
01:01:18,629 --> 01:01:21,090
WE GAVE THEM YOUR MEDICINE
BEHIND JEFF'S BACK.

1032
01:01:21,132 --> 01:01:22,592
DON'T EVER LET HIM
KNOW ABOUT IT, THOUGH.

1033
01:01:26,596 --> 01:01:28,097
WELL, COME ON, MACK,
LET'S HAVE IT.

1034
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:30,600
WHAT?

1035
01:01:30,641 --> 01:01:31,601
THE BAD NEWS.

1036
01:01:32,101 --> 01:01:33,102
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

1037
01:01:33,144 --> 01:01:36,105
ALL OVER YOU
EVER SINCE YOU GOT HERE.

1038
01:01:36,147 --> 01:01:38,608
I'VE GOT A HUNCH CHAMBERLAIN'S
UP TO SOMETHING.

1039
01:01:38,649 --> 01:01:40,109
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

1040
01:01:40,151 --> 01:01:42,111
ALL OVER HIM THE LAST TIME
I SAW HIM.

1041
01:01:42,612 --> 01:01:46,616
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, JIM.
HE'S UP TO PLENTY.

1042
01:01:46,657 --> 01:01:48,117
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO YOUR BUSINESS
AND YOUR BRANDY.

1043
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:50,578
NO, NO, SIT DOWN. MACK'S A LAWYER.

1044
01:01:50,578 --> 01:01:52,121
HE LIKES AN AUDIENCE.

1045
01:02:02,632 --> 01:02:05,635
CHAMBERLAIN'S GOT SALT FORK
MADE A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT.

1046
01:02:05,635 --> 01:02:08,137
GOT HIMSELF ELECTED JUDGE.

1047
01:02:08,137 --> 01:02:09,639
WHAT ABOUT JUDGE WHITE?

1048
01:02:10,139 --> 01:02:11,641
ONLY LOCAL MATTERS NOW.

1049
01:02:11,641 --> 01:02:13,643
OH, IS THAT SO?

1050
01:02:13,643 --> 01:02:16,145
AND HERES CHAMBERLAIN'S
MESSAGE TO YOU, JIM.

1051
01:02:16,646 --> 01:02:18,648
TOMORROW HE'S SENDING NOTICE TO
EVERY SQUATTER IN TOWN

1052
01:02:18,648 --> 01:02:20,149
AND THERE'S A WHOLE
THE WAGON TRAIN OF 'EM-

1053
01:02:20,608 --> 01:02:22,109
THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S
REPRESENTED HERE NOW

1054
01:02:22,151 --> 01:02:23,611
AND WILL THEM
FULL PROTECTION.

1055
01:02:23,653 --> 01:02:27,114
YOU'LL HAVE A HUNDRED CLAIMS ON
YOUR RANGE BEFORE THE WEEK IS OUT.

1056
01:02:27,156 --> 01:02:28,616
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE OUGHT TO DO, MACK?

1057
01:02:28,658 --> 01:02:30,284
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR A CHANCE-

1058
01:02:30,284 --> 01:02:32,119
ANY CHANCE OF ANY
KIND- TO HEAD IT OFF

1059
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,621
BUT THERE ISN'T ANY.

1060
01:02:33,663 --> 01:02:35,122
IT'S THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT NOW,

1061
01:02:35,164 --> 01:02:36,999
THE LAW OF THE LAND,
AND IT'S OBEYED.

1062
01:02:36,999 --> 01:02:39,210
IT'S GOT TO BE.

1063
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:43,130
WHAT DO YOU THINK, LUTIE?

1064
01:02:43,631 --> 01:02:49,637
I? WELL, I THINK
MACK HAS SAID IT, JIM.

1065
01:02:52,139 --> 01:02:56,143
IT HAD TO HAPPEN, JIM.
EVERYONE KNEW IT.

1066
01:02:56,185 --> 01:02:58,145
I THINK YOU DID
IN YOUR HEART.

1067
01:02:58,187 --> 01:03:00,147
NO.

1068
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,652
NO, I DIDN'T, LUTIE.

1069
01:03:11,158 --> 01:03:13,160
WELL!

1070
01:03:13,202 --> 01:03:14,662
GOOD.

1071
01:03:14,704 --> 01:03:16,163
GOOD NIGHT DEAR.

1072
01:03:16,664 --> 01:03:18,165
HOW IS YOUR FINGER
WHERE YOU CUT IT?

1073
01:03:18,207 --> 01:03:19,166
YOU TOLD ME
IT WOULDN'T HURT.

1074
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:20,668
WELL, IT WON'T HURT, EITHER.

1075
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:22,670
ANYTHING YOU SAY
GOES, HUH, JIM?

1076
01:03:22,712 --> 01:03:24,672
SURE. SHE'S JIM'S GIRL.
HER FIRST CRUSH.

1077
01:03:24,714 --> 01:03:26,173
COME, SARAH BETH.

1078
01:03:26,215 --> 01:03:27,174
GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.

1079
01:03:27,675 --> 01:03:28,676
GOOD NIGHT.

1080
01:03:28,718 --> 01:03:29,677
GOOD NIGHT, LUTIE.
VERY NICE DINNER.

1081
01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:30,678
THANK YOU.

1082
01:03:31,178 --> 01:03:32,680
GOOD NIGHT, LUTIE.

1083
01:03:34,181 --> 01:03:35,683
GOOD NIGHT, JIM.

1084
01:03:39,186 --> 01:03:40,688
GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.

1085
01:03:48,195 --> 01:03:50,698
DON'T GET LUTIE
WRONG, JIM.

1086
01:03:51,198 --> 01:03:53,200
SHE'S A WOMAN,
AND, WELL..

1087
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,203
I DON'T GET HER
WRONG, DOC.

1088
01:03:56,203 --> 01:03:59,707
IT'S JUST THAT I KEEP
WISHING SHE WAS REALLY ON MY SIDE.

1089
01:04:02,168 --> 01:04:04,170
WELL, HELP YOURSELVES,
GENTLEMEN.

1090
01:04:05,671 --> 01:04:07,673
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO, JIM?

1091
01:04:07,715 --> 01:04:10,676
RIGHT NOW? GOING FOR
A LITTLE WALK.

1092
01:04:12,178 --> 01:04:15,681
IS THAT COLD?

1093
01:04:15,723 --> 01:04:19,185
BANTY,
BRING JOE.

1094
01:04:20,227 --> 01:04:21,187
HOLD HER A MINUTE.

1095
01:04:23,189 --> 01:04:24,690
CAN I GO UNDER THERE?

1096
01:04:30,196 --> 01:04:31,197
ANDY, YOU TAKE THE DAVIS PLACE
AND MCGEE'S RANCH.

1097
01:04:31,238 --> 01:04:32,698
TELL THEM I WANTS TO SEE THEM.

1098
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,700
TELL THEM IT WON'T HURT
TO BRING THEIR WINCHESTERS.

1099
01:04:34,742 --> 01:04:36,702
WAKE, YOU TAKE VALEZ'S RANCH AND
THE OUTFIT SOUTH.

1100
01:04:36,744 --> 01:04:38,204
YOU BET, COLONEL.

1101
01:04:38,245 --> 01:04:39,205
GET GOING.

1102
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:46,212
YOU WERE GOING
TO PUT ME TO BED.

1103
01:04:46,712 --> 01:04:49,215
YES, DARLING. I'LL COME RIGHT
BACK AND PUT YOU TO BED.

1104
01:04:49,256 --> 01:04:50,716
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1105
01:05:12,738 --> 01:05:14,240
I COULD CRY FOR YOU, JIM

1106
01:05:14,281 --> 01:05:15,741
DON'T WASTE IT
ON ME, LUTIE.

1107
01:05:15,783 --> 01:05:17,243
WHY DON'T YOU GO UP AND TRY TO
GET SOME SLEEP?

1108
01:05:17,743 --> 01:05:19,245
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT I NEED.

1109
01:05:19,286 --> 01:05:20,746
WHY DO YOU KEEP
LOOKING AT ME?

1110
01:05:20,788 --> 01:05:22,748
WHAT DO YOU KEEP
WANTING OF ME?

1111
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:25,751
NOTHING, LUTIE. NOTHING ANYMORE.
I DON'T EXPECT IT.

1112
01:05:28,254 --> 01:05:29,755
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO, JIM?

1113
01:05:29,755 --> 01:05:31,757
IF CHAMBERLAIN WANTS TO DECLARE WAR,
HE'S GOING TO GET IT.

1114
01:05:31,757 --> 01:05:33,259
YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO GO OUT
AND SHOOT

1115
01:05:33,259 --> 01:05:34,760
THE FIRST HOMESTEADERS THAT
COME OVER?

1116
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,262
THAT'S RIGHT.

1117
01:05:36,262 --> 01:05:37,263
IN COLD BLOOD?

1118
01:05:37,763 --> 01:05:38,764
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT TO CALL IT.

1119
01:05:38,764 --> 01:05:39,765
DON'T DO IT, JIM.
GIVE UP ON IT.

1120
01:05:39,765 --> 01:05:40,766
WHO ARE YOU
PROTECTING?

1121
01:05:40,766 --> 01:05:42,268
YOU, JIM. YOU.

1122
01:05:42,268 --> 01:05:43,769
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO LOSE?

1123
01:05:43,769 --> 01:05:45,271
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

1124
01:05:45,271 --> 01:05:47,273
BUT YOU DO, DON'T YOU?

1125
01:05:47,273 --> 01:05:48,732
WELL, I-I GUESS SO.
MAYBE I DO.

1126
01:05:48,774 --> 01:05:50,234
WHY? WHY?

1127
01:05:50,275 --> 01:05:51,735
I... I... MAYBE THEN
I'D HAVE A CHANCE.

1128
01:05:51,777 --> 01:05:53,237
MAYBE YOU'D TURN
TO ME-TO ME ALONE.

1129
01:05:53,278 --> 01:05:54,738
IS THAT THE ONLY REASON?

1130
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,240
JIM, IT'S MURDER,
KILLING PEOPLE.

1131
01:05:56,281 --> 01:05:57,741
I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD BEAR IT.

1132
01:05:58,242 --> 01:06:00,744
I... I'VE TRIED TO FIT IN, I'VE TRIED TO
BE WHAT YOU WANT, BUT...

1133
01:06:00,786 --> 01:06:02,246
YOU HAVE DONE THAT.
I'VE SEEN YOU TRYING.

1134
01:06:02,287 --> 01:06:03,747
BUT TO GO OUT
IN COLD BLOOD...

1135
01:06:03,789 --> 01:06:05,749
BUT I'VE SEEN OTHER THINGS I'VE SAID
NOTHING ABOUT.

1136
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:07,751
THEY'RE INNOCENT PEOPLE, JIM.

1137
01:06:07,793 --> 01:06:10,254
I'M GOING TO DO
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

1138
01:06:13,757 --> 01:06:15,259
ALL RIGHT, JIM.

1139
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,760
ALL RIGHT, WHAT?

1140
01:06:16,802 --> 01:06:18,262
DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
I'VE NOTHING MORE TO SAY.

1141
01:06:18,762 --> 01:06:19,763
AND WHAT WILL YOU DO?

1142
01:06:19,805 --> 01:06:22,266
NOTHING. I'LL WAIT.

1143
01:06:22,307 --> 01:06:24,768
NOTHING MORE TO SAY?

1144
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:25,769
NO.

1145
01:06:27,771 --> 01:06:31,275
YOU'D GO ON LIVING WITH A MURDERER,
LUTIE? WHY?

1146
01:06:31,316 --> 01:06:33,277
WHY DO YOU OWE ME THAT?
THAT'S A LOT.

1147
01:06:33,318 --> 01:06:35,279
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT ONCE.
YOU'VE CHANGED/

1148
01:06:35,779 --> 01:06:38,782
WHAT CHANGED YOU?
WHY DO YOU OWE ME SO MUCH?

1149
01:06:38,824 --> 01:06:40,784
THE TRIP TO DENVER, MAYBE?

1150
01:06:40,826 --> 01:06:45,789
YOU NEVER REALLY TOLD ME
WHY YOU CAME BACK HERE.

1151
01:06:45,831 --> 01:06:47,791
DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
NOW, LUTIE?

1152
01:06:52,296 --> 01:06:54,298
NOTHING MORE TO DAY.

1153
01:06:56,300 --> 01:07:00,304
WELL, I GUESS THAT
SAYS IT ALL.

1154
01:07:00,345 --> 01:07:03,307
IT TOOK A LONG TIME
BUT IT'S ALL SET NOW.

1155
01:07:05,809 --> 01:07:11,315
I TRIED, JIM. I TRIED.

1156
01:07:11,732 --> 01:07:14,318
MORE THAN ONCE.
BUT YOU JUST LOOKED AT ME.

1157
01:07:14,818 --> 01:07:19,323
YOU JUST LOOKED AT ME
AND STOPPED ME.

1158
01:07:19,323 --> 01:07:23,827
I COULDN'T. I COULDN'T.

1159
01:07:23,827 --> 01:07:25,829
BUT NOW I'M GLAD
IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN.

1160
01:07:25,829 --> 01:07:28,290
I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS.

1161
01:07:28,332 --> 01:07:32,294
I'M GLAD IT'S OUT
AFTER 2 YEARS. I'M GLAD IT'S OUT.

1162
01:07:40,302 --> 01:07:43,805
WHEN DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE, LUTIE?

1163
01:07:43,847 --> 01:07:46,308
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.

1164
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:48,310
THEN WHEN ARE YOU
GOINGTO LEAVE?

1165
01:07:50,312 --> 01:07:51,813
YOU CAN CATCH THE NEXT TRAIN.

1166
01:07:51,855 --> 01:07:55,317
YOU'D BETTER GO UP AND PACK.
WE'LL START IN THE MORNING.

1167
01:07:55,359 --> 01:08:00,322
I DON'T SEE HOW,
WITH ALL THE CHILDREN'S THINGS.

1168
01:08:00,364 --> 01:08:03,825
THE CHILDREN'S THINGS?
YOU WON'T HAVE TO PACK THOSE.

1169
01:08:05,327 --> 01:08:06,328
YOU THINK I'D LEAVE THEM HERE?

1170
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:07,829
I'M SURE OF IT.

1171
01:08:07,871 --> 01:08:08,830
I COULDN'T LEAVE THEM.

1172
01:08:08,872 --> 01:08:09,831
YOU CAN TAKE
ONE OF THEM, LUTIE.

1173
01:08:09,873 --> 01:08:10,832
ONE?

1174
01:08:10,874 --> 01:08:12,334
YOU CAN TAKE BROCK.

1175
01:08:12,834 --> 01:08:13,835
BUT IF YOU TAKE HIM

1176
01:08:13,835 --> 01:08:15,837
YOU TAKE EVERYTHING THAT GOES WITH IT,

1177
01:08:15,879 --> 01:08:17,839
AND SO DOES HE.

1178
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:20,133
IF YOU LEAVE HIM

1179
01:08:20,133 --> 01:08:24,346
I'LL BRING HIM UP, AND I'LL DO FOR HIM.

1180
01:08:27,349 --> 01:08:29,351
A MAN WANTS A SON.

1181
01:08:39,361 --> 01:08:40,362
ALL RIGHT, JIM.

1182
01:08:42,364 --> 01:08:44,866
I THOUGHT YOU'D
SEE IT MY WAY.

1183
01:08:46,368 --> 01:08:51,873
BUT I... I WON'T LET YOU KEEP
THEM FOREVER. I'LL FIGHT.

1184
01:08:52,374 --> 01:08:54,376
THAT'S ONE FIGHT
I WOULDN'T LOSE, LUTIE.

1185
01:08:56,878 --> 01:08:59,381
YOU STILL CARRY HIM
IN YOUR HEART. DON'T YOU?

1186
01:08:59,381 --> 01:09:01,883
I CARRY YOU
IN MY HEART, JIM

1187
01:09:01,883 --> 01:09:04,886
I LOVE YOU. CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?
I LOVE YOU.

1188
01:09:05,387 --> 01:09:08,390
YOU COULDN'T LOVE ME
AND BE AGAINST ME.

1189
01:09:16,857 --> 01:09:18,859
YOU'LL BOTH HAVE TO BE
VERY GOOD FOR JEFF.

1190
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:22,863
AND SARAH BETH, DARLING.
YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF BRCK, WON'T YOU?

1191
01:09:22,904 --> 01:09:26,366
OH, DARLING, YOU'RE SO LITTLE.
YOU WON'T REMEMBER, YOU CAN'T.

1192
01:09:26,408 --> 01:09:28,869
I'LL REMEMBER.

1193
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:30,370
THE COLONEL'S READY NOW, MRS. BREWTON.

1194
01:09:30,412 --> 01:09:32,873
CAN I GO FOR A RIDE TOO,
TOO, MAMA?

1195
01:09:32,914 --> 01:09:34,875
NOT TODAY, DARLING.

1196
01:09:34,916 --> 01:09:37,878
REMEMBER, I'LL BE BACK
SOONER THAN SOON,

1197
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,880
WITH A DOUBLE
PRESENT FOR BOTH.

1198
01:10:03,403 --> 01:10:06,406
GOOD-BYE, JEFF.
YOU'VE BEEN A FRIEND.

1199
01:10:06,907 --> 01:10:08,408
DON'T YOU WORRY,
MRS. BREWTON.

1200
01:10:11,411 --> 01:10:14,414
SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT ME
TO MY CHILDREN, JEFF.

1201
01:10:22,422 --> 01:10:24,424
GOODBYE.

1202
01:10:24,466 --> 01:10:25,425
GOODBYE, DOC.

1203
01:10:25,467 --> 01:10:26,927
YOU BE GOOD.

1204
01:10:32,432 --> 01:10:33,934
READY?

1205
01:10:47,948 --> 01:10:49,950
DOC GAVE ME THIS
CHECK FROM YOU.

1206
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:52,452
ALL ABOARD!

1207
01:10:54,913 --> 01:10:56,915
IS THIS THE WAY
WE SAY GOODBYE?

1208
01:10:59,918 --> 01:11:02,921
YOU SAID GOOD-BYE, LUTIE.
TWO YEARS AGO.

1209
01:11:25,443 --> 01:11:26,945
HE'S JUST TURNING
IN THE DOOR.

1210
01:11:34,953 --> 01:11:37,956
COME IN, JIM. GLAD YOU COULD
MAKE IT.

1211
01:11:43,962 --> 01:11:45,463
WHAT DID YOU GET ME
HERE FOR, DOC?

1212
01:11:45,505 --> 01:11:46,965
WELL, JIM, I GOT A FUNNY FEELING

1213
01:11:47,007 --> 01:11:48,967
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING
TO BE KILLED.

1214
01:11:49,009 --> 01:11:50,468
BUT YOU TWO
CAN STOP IT.

1215
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:51,553
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, DOC.

1216
01:11:51,553 --> 01:11:53,179
THE LAW'S GOING TO BE
ENFORCED. THAT'S ALL.

1217
01:11:55,181 --> 01:11:56,266
I'LL SEE YOU LATER DOC.

1218
01:11:59,978 --> 01:12:02,981
DON'T BE A FOOL, BREWTON.
GO AFTER HER.

1219
01:12:03,023 --> 01:12:06,484
I NEVER HAD A CHANCE.
I TRIED.

1220
01:12:06,526 --> 01:12:09,487
I TRIED IN DENVER
AND AGAIN YESTERDAY BEFORE SHE LEFT.

1221
01:12:09,529 --> 01:12:13,491
YOU WERE IN THE WAY.
YOU STILL ARE.

1222
01:12:20,999 --> 01:12:23,001
HI, COLONEL!
WE'RE ALL SET.

1223
01:12:29,507 --> 01:12:32,010
EVERYBODY'S ALL HERE, COLONEL-EVERY
COWMAN WHO COULD SET A HORSE.

1224
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:32,761
THERE'S MORE AMMUNITION.

1225
01:12:32,761 --> 01:12:34,512
TELL THEM TO HELP THEMSELVES.
I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE.

1226
01:12:34,512 --> 01:12:37,515
RIGHT. HERE'S MORE AMMUNITION,
BOYS. COME AND GET IT!

1227
01:12:37,515 --> 01:12:39,517
COME AND GET IT, BOYS!

1228
01:12:39,517 --> 01:12:40,477
THERE'S MORE AMMUNITION HERE.

1229
01:12:40,518 --> 01:12:41,978
MORE AMMUNITION HERE...

1230
01:13:36,032 --> 01:13:38,535
PHELPS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE, PRACTICE MARCH?

1231
01:13:39,035 --> 01:13:40,537
NO, I WISH IT WERE.

1232
01:13:41,037 --> 01:13:42,539
I'M HERE TO SEE THAT THE
HOMESTEADERS ARE LET ALONE.

1233
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:44,040
OH?

1234
01:13:44,541 --> 01:13:45,792
NOW, DON'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT, JIM.

1235
01:13:45,792 --> 01:13:46,584
I'M A COWMAN MYSELF.

1236
01:13:46,584 --> 01:13:49,045
I SETTLED OUT HERE
THE SAME TIME YOU DID.

1237
01:13:49,045 --> 01:13:50,046
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

1238
01:13:50,088 --> 01:13:52,549
BUT MY ORDERS COME FROM
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

1239
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:55,051
AND THEY SAY TO KEEP
THE PEACE OUT HERE.

1240
01:13:55,093 --> 01:13:56,553
SO I GUESS I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO TRY.

1241
01:13:56,594 --> 01:13:58,054
THAT SO?

1242
01:13:58,096 --> 01:14:02,058
THE MEN I'VE GOT ARE GOOD MEN.
THEY'LL DO AS THEIR ORDERS READ.

1243
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,059
A LOT OF THEM MAY DIE.

1244
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,061
YOU'VE GOT GOOD MEN, TOO.

1245
01:14:05,103 --> 01:14:08,064
LOOKS AS THOUGH
YOU OUTNUMBER US.

1246
01:14:08,064 --> 01:14:09,566
SO YOU'D PROBABLY
WIN TODAY.

1247
01:14:09,566 --> 01:14:11,568
BUT NOTHING WOULD STAY WON.

1248
01:14:11,568 --> 01:14:13,278
THEY'D SEND A REGIMENT OUT HERE

1249
01:14:13,278 --> 01:14:16,072
IF IT WAS NECESSARY AND
ALL YOUR MEN WOULD BE DEAD.

1250
01:14:16,573 --> 01:14:20,577
NOT ONLY YOU-YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT
TO DECIDE THAT YOURSELF-BUT THEM TOO.

1251
01:14:20,577 --> 01:14:24,038
AS I SAID BEFORE, JIM.
THEY'RE GOOD MEN.

1252
01:14:32,547 --> 01:14:35,049
THEY'RE REAL GOOD MEN.

1253
01:14:43,558 --> 01:14:45,560
WELL, BOYS, I'M AFRAID
WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIGHT,

1254
01:14:45,602 --> 01:14:48,563
UNLESS SOMEBODY FEELS
DIFFERENT ABOUT IT.

1255
01:14:52,066 --> 01:14:54,068
SO, I GUESS WE'LL JUST GO ON HOME.

1256
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:56,571
MAYBE ONE OF THESE DAYS
WE'LL BE SORRY WE DID.

1257
01:14:58,573 --> 01:15:01,075
THEY CAN KEEP THE NESTOR FROM
BEING BLOWN AWAY

1258
01:15:01,117 --> 01:15:04,579
BUT ONLY
GOD CAN HELP THE PRAIRIE.

1259
01:15:24,599 --> 01:15:28,603
NOW, UM, UH, LET ME UNDERSTAND
THIS CLEARLY, MR. CRANE.

1260
01:15:28,644 --> 01:15:32,106
UH, YOU BELIEVE THAT I MAY BE
ABLE TO GAIN CUSTODY OF MY SON

1261
01:15:32,148 --> 01:15:34,901
BUT TO DO THIS, I MUST
ESTABLISH IN THE COURT

1262
01:15:34,901 --> 01:15:37,111
UNDER OATH THE IDENTITY OF HIS FATHER?

1263
01:15:37,153 --> 01:15:40,615
IN ORDER TO HAVE HIM
LEGALLY, IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

1264
01:15:41,115 --> 01:15:45,620
AND-AND IT IS ALSO YOUR OPINION
THAT IF I DO PROVE MY RIGHT TO HIM

1265
01:15:45,661 --> 01:15:48,122
I MAY FORFEIT MY RIGHT
TO MY DAUGHTER?

1266
01:15:48,122 --> 01:15:51,626
I'M AFRAID THAT'S
THE SIZE OF IT, LUTIE.

1267
01:15:51,626 --> 01:15:53,086
YOU WOULD, IN THE EYES

1268
01:15:53,086 --> 01:15:56,631
OF THE COURT, FOREVER PROVE
YOUR UNFITNESS TO HAVE HER.

1269
01:15:56,631 --> 01:15:59,133
BUT WITH LUCK,
YOU COULD HAVE BROCK.

1270
01:16:02,136 --> 01:16:07,642
YES, WITH LUCK, I'D
SUCCEED IN BRANDING ONE,

1271
01:16:07,642 --> 01:16:10,603
SEPARATING THEM
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

1272
01:16:12,605 --> 01:16:14,607
I'M SORRY, LUTIE.

1273
01:16:22,615 --> 01:16:24,617
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?

1274
01:16:24,659 --> 01:16:27,120
ARE YOU GOING TO STAY
IN ST. LOUIS, MY DEAR?

1275
01:16:27,161 --> 01:16:29,622
WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
MR. CRANE.

1276
01:16:30,123 --> 01:16:31,249
SINCE MY FATHER DIED

1277
01:16:31,249 --> 01:16:33,626
I DON'T SEEM TO BELONG
HERE ANYMORE, EITHER.

1278
01:16:34,127 --> 01:16:36,129
GOOD-BYE. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

1279
01:16:41,134 --> 01:16:42,635
WRITE TO ME, DOC.

1280
01:16:42,677 --> 01:16:45,638
LET ME KNOW ABOUT MY BABIES.
HOW THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY DO.

1281
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:50,142
KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ME PLEASE.
LOVE, LUTIE.

1282
01:16:59,652 --> 01:17:01,654
YOU ARE MISSED, LUTIE.

1283
01:17:02,154 --> 01:17:05,867
IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY BLEW OUT
A LIGHT, AND IT'S A LITTLE

1284
01:17:05,867 --> 01:17:07,159
DARKER FOR ALL OF US.

1285
01:17:07,201 --> 01:17:10,162
JIM HAD THE CHILDREN IN
THE OTHER DAY FOR ME TO LOOK OVER.

1286
01:17:10,204 --> 01:17:12,665
AND THEY'RE HEALTHY
AS GOATS.

1287
01:17:12,707 --> 01:17:15,167
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
SALT FORK, LUTIE.

1288
01:17:15,209 --> 01:17:17,128
THE TOWN'S JAM-PACKED EVERY DAY.

1289
01:17:17,128 --> 01:17:20,172
STOREKEEPERS ARE TRUCKING
TO THE HOMESTEADERS, NOW.

1290
01:17:20,214 --> 01:17:21,632
HARDLY EVER SEE A CATTLEMAN

1291
01:17:21,632 --> 01:17:24,176
ANYMORE, UNLESS IT'S
WHEN THEY COME IN TO FIGHT

1292
01:17:24,218 --> 01:17:26,470
AND LOSE ONE OF THE
LAWSUITS THAT'S ALWAYS BEING

1293
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:27,680
SLAPPED ON THEM BY FARMERS.

1294
01:17:27,722 --> 01:17:30,182
THE COURT THEREFORE
FIXES DAMAGES.

1295
01:17:30,224 --> 01:17:34,186
FOR THE FULL MARKET VALUE
OF THE MATURED CROP.

1296
01:17:41,193 --> 01:17:43,696
CHAMBERLAIN WAS HEARD
TO SAY THAT GOD WAS

1297
01:17:43,696 --> 01:17:45,197
ON THE SIDE OF THE HOMESTEADERS.

1298
01:17:45,698 --> 01:17:47,241
I DON'T KNOW AS I COULD SPEAK

1299
01:17:47,241 --> 01:17:50,161
FOR HIM BUT I'VE GOT TO
ADMIT THAT THE CROPS ARE GOOD.

1300
01:17:50,202 --> 01:17:51,370
THE HEADS ON THE WHEAT ARE

1301
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:53,164
SO HEAVY, THEY'LL
KNOCK A MAN'S HEAD OFF.

1302
01:17:53,205 --> 01:17:57,668
AND THE CORN CAN SWALLOW UP
A HORSE AND RIDER.

1303
01:17:57,710 --> 01:17:59,587
THIS IS RICH LAND, ALL RIGHT.

1304
01:17:59,587 --> 01:18:02,673
AND THE SODBUSTERS ARE
REAPING ITS FIRST FLOWER.

1305
01:18:02,715 --> 01:18:06,677
MAYBE THAT WHAT GOD
ORDERED, I DON'T KNOW.

1306
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,179
YOU ASK ABOUT JIM.

1307
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:10,181
WELL, HE NEVER SAYS MUCH

1308
01:18:10,222 --> 01:18:12,016
BUT HIS BACK'S A LITTLE STRAIGHTER

1309
01:18:12,016 --> 01:18:14,185
AND HIS HEAD'S A
LITTLE HIGHER THAN EVER.

1310
01:18:14,685 --> 01:18:18,189
SARAH BETH FOLLOWS HER FATHER AROUND
LIKE SHE WAS A LONESOME PUP.

1311
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:22,652
I GOT TO ADMIT THAT JIM TREATS
HER ABOUT LIKE SHE WAS A PUP.

1312
01:18:22,652 --> 01:18:24,695
NOT THAT HE ISN'T GOOD TO HER.

1313
01:18:24,737 --> 01:18:29,200
I GUESS IT'S THIS WAY.
SARAH BETH GIVES ALL TO JIM.

1314
01:18:29,241 --> 01:18:31,202
AND HE GIVES IT ALL
TO BROCK.

1315
01:18:31,243 --> 01:18:34,705
AND BROCK... WELL, BROCK'S LIKE
HE ALWAYS WAS-

1316
01:18:34,747 --> 01:18:38,709
TEMPER LIKE A BUZZ SAW
AND A SMILE LIKE A FEATHERED ANGEL.

1317
01:18:51,222 --> 01:18:53,724
OH DOC, I AM LONELY,

1318
01:18:53,766 --> 01:18:59,730
BUT I KNOW I SHOULD STAY AWAY, AND
I WILL JUST AS LONG AS I CAN.

1319
01:19:00,231 --> 01:19:02,233
JUST AS LONG AS I CAN.

1320
01:19:12,743 --> 01:19:14,245
DOC!

1321
01:19:14,245 --> 01:19:15,246
LUTIE! OH!

1322
01:19:15,246 --> 01:19:16,247
OH!

1323
01:19:17,748 --> 01:19:19,250
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.

1324
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:20,751
RIG IS RIGHT OVER HERE.

1325
01:19:26,757 --> 01:19:29,260
IT'S ALL CHANGED.

1326
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:31,262
YES...

1327
01:19:46,235 --> 01:19:49,280
TELL ME, LUTIE, WHY DID YOU REALLY COME?

1328
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,240
JUST TO SEE THE CHILDREN?

1329
01:19:51,282 --> 01:19:55,244
THAT MOSTLY. IT'S BEEN
PRETTY BAD, DOC.

1330
01:19:56,745 --> 01:19:58,247
WHERE'S JIM?

1331
01:19:58,747 --> 01:19:59,748
WAITING AT THE HOTEL.

1332
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:01,250
WAITING?

1333
01:20:01,292 --> 01:20:03,252
TO TAKE THE CHILDREN HOME
AFTER YOU'VE SEEN THEM.

1334
01:20:03,294 --> 01:20:07,756
OH. DID HE MIND
ABOUT MY SEEING THEM?

1335
01:20:07,798 --> 01:20:12,761
HE DIDN'T SAY ONE WAY
OR THE OTHER.

1336
01:20:12,803 --> 01:20:16,181
DOC... WHAT ABOUT JIM?

1337
01:20:16,181 --> 01:20:22,187
WHERE I'M CONCERNED, I MEAN? TELL ME.

1338
01:20:22,313 --> 01:20:27,776
HONEY, IT'S PRETTY HARD TO SAY.

1339
01:20:27,818 --> 01:20:32,281
HE'S JUST NEVER MENTIONED
YOUR NAME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

1340
01:20:32,323 --> 01:20:34,283
THANK YOU.

1341
01:20:44,793 --> 01:20:46,795
ALL RIGHT, MRS. SMITH.

1342
01:21:25,292 --> 01:21:30,297
DOC... THEY DON'T KNOW ME.

1343
01:21:30,339 --> 01:21:31,632
THEY'RE VERY YOUNG.

1344
01:21:31,632 --> 01:21:34,802
IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS,
LUTIE. YOU CAN'T EXPECT IT.

1345
01:21:35,302 --> 01:21:40,307
NO, I DON'T EXPECT IT.
I ONLY HOPED.

1346
01:21:42,309 --> 01:21:46,313
DO YOU REMEMBER? I SAID I'D BRING
A DOUBLE PRESENT FOR BOTH OF YOU?

1347
01:21:46,814 --> 01:21:48,315
DO YOU REMEMBER, SARAH BETH?

1348
01:21:48,816 --> 01:21:50,818
NO.

1349
01:21:50,859 --> 01:21:52,820
BUT YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE A PRESENT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

1350
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,321
YES.

1351
01:21:54,363 --> 01:21:57,825
THEN YOU WAIT. AND LOOK AT
WHAT I HAVE IN MY BAG.

1352
01:21:57,866 --> 01:21:59,827
NOW, YOU LOOK IN THE BAG.

1353
01:22:19,847 --> 01:22:21,849
SAW HER OFF GETTING OFF THE TRAIN
AS BIG AS LIFE.

1354
01:22:22,349 --> 01:22:23,350
WENT RIGHT OVER TO DOC REID'S.

1355
01:22:49,376 --> 01:22:51,378
YOU MUST LEAVE
AT ONCE, BRICE.

1356
01:22:51,378 --> 01:22:53,380
DO YOU REALIZE I'VE NEVER EVEN
TOUCHED HIM BEFORE.

1357
01:22:53,380 --> 01:22:57,885
NEVER BEEN CLOSE ENOUGH TO LOOK
INTO HIS EYES. HE'S A FINE BOY.

1358
01:22:57,885 --> 01:22:59,344
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME HERE.

1359
01:23:10,856 --> 01:23:11,565
BROCK.

1360
01:23:24,369 --> 01:23:25,078
JIM.

1361
01:23:31,376 --> 01:23:33,879
COME ON, KIDS.
TIME TO GO NOW.

1362
01:23:37,382 --> 01:23:39,384
I'M SORRY, LUTIE.

1363
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,903
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
COME BACK.

1364
01:23:57,945 --> 01:24:01,907
I'VE BROUGHT EVERYTHING
TO LIFE AGAIN.

1365
01:24:01,949 --> 01:24:04,409
AND THE CHILDREN, BRICE,
THEY DON'T KNOW ME.

1366
01:24:04,451 --> 01:24:06,411
I'M NOT SURE THEY EVEN
LIKE ME.

1367
01:24:06,453 --> 01:24:09,414
THEY WERE JUST WAITING
FOR THE TIME TO GO HOME.

1368
01:24:09,456 --> 01:24:12,417
THEY DON'T NEED ME. THEY DON'T
NEED ANYTHING FROM ME.

1369
01:24:12,459 --> 01:24:13,752
LISTEN TO ME, LUTIE.

1370
01:24:13,752 --> 01:24:16,421
YOU AND I, WE COULD
GET BROCK. HE'S OURS.

1371
01:24:16,463 --> 01:24:18,423
LET BREWTON HAVE
SARAH BETH.

1372
01:24:18,465 --> 01:24:21,927
WE COULD TAKE BROCK AWAY
HE BELONGS WITH YOU AND ME.

1373
01:24:21,969 --> 01:24:26,431
WE CAN GET AS FAR AWAY FROM HERE
AS TRAINS COULD CARRY US.

1374
01:24:26,473 --> 01:24:28,934
THIS IS OUR LAST
CHANCE, LUTIE.

1375
01:24:28,934 --> 01:24:30,936
THE LAST CHANCE
FOR THE 3 OF US.

1376
01:24:33,438 --> 01:24:35,941
I CAN'T GO AWAY WITH YOU, BRICE.

1377
01:24:35,941 --> 01:24:39,444
I CAN'T HAVE BROCK.
AND I CAN'T HAVE SARAH BETH.

1378
01:24:39,444 --> 01:24:42,406
SO I'M GOING TO GO,
BUT I'LL GO ALONE.

1379
01:24:45,909 --> 01:24:48,412
AND YOU'VE GOT
NOTHING FOR ME.

1380
01:24:50,914 --> 01:24:55,419
NOT ENOUGH, BRICE.
NOT ENOUGH FOR THAT.

1381
01:26:02,486 --> 01:26:03,487
COME ON IN.

1382
01:26:14,998 --> 01:26:16,499
DOC?

1383
01:26:18,001 --> 01:26:21,004
GLAD MACK GOT
YOU HERE, JIM.

1384
01:26:21,504 --> 01:26:23,506
HAVEN'T BEEN SEEING
VERY MUCH OF YOU LATELY.

1385
01:26:23,506 --> 01:26:25,508
I HAVEN'T BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

1386
01:26:25,508 --> 01:26:28,011
SO I NOTICED.

1387
01:26:28,011 --> 01:26:33,975
I USED TO LOVE YOU
LIKE THE SON I NEVER HAD.

1388
01:26:34,476 --> 01:26:37,479
NOT ANYMORE.
YOU KNOW WHY?

1389
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,981
MAYBE YOU BETTER
NOT TALK ABOUT IT NOW, DOC.

1390
01:26:40,482 --> 01:26:44,486
I GOT TO. I'LL TELL
YOU WHY-LUTIE.

1391
01:26:44,527 --> 01:26:48,990
I CAN SAY IT NOW-LUTIE.

1392
01:26:49,032 --> 01:26:53,995
YOU WOULDN'T LET ANYBODY
SPEAK HER NAME, WOULD YOU, JIM?

1393
01:26:54,037 --> 01:26:55,997
BUT YOU GOT TO HUMOR ME.

1394
01:26:56,039 --> 01:26:59,000
LAST WISH, YOU KNOW.

1395
01:27:00,502 --> 01:27:06,007
ALL LUTIE NEEDED WAS...
WAS A LITTLE HELP... FROM YOU.

1396
01:27:06,049 --> 01:27:10,512
SHE HAD BETTER COMING
THAN SHE GOT.

1397
01:27:10,553 --> 01:27:14,516
SHE NEVER FORGOT HER CHILDREN.
SHE WAS ALL RIGHT.

1398
01:27:16,518 --> 01:27:20,021
AND YOU SENT HER
AWAY TWICE. YOUR FAULT.

1399
01:27:20,063 --> 01:27:22,357
THAT'S RIGHT. YOURS.

1400
01:27:22,357 --> 01:27:27,529
PEOPLE DON'T TELL YOU THAT
MUCH, DO THEY, JIM?

1401
01:27:32,033 --> 01:27:33,034
JIM.

1402
01:27:37,038 --> 01:27:38,039
JIM!

1403
01:27:41,543 --> 01:27:43,044
DO YOU HEAR ME?

1404
01:27:45,046 --> 01:27:46,548
YES, DOC, I HEAR YOU.

1405
01:27:51,553 --> 01:27:54,055
YOU'LL-YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE.

1406
01:27:56,558 --> 01:27:59,561
YOU'VE STILL GOT THAT SAME
LOOK IN YOUR EYES.

1407
01:28:03,565 --> 01:28:05,066
YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE.

1408
01:28:18,538 --> 01:28:23,042
THE DOC... OUT OF HIS HEAD,
I GUESS, JIM.

1409
01:28:23,084 --> 01:28:28,548
NO. HE WAS RIGHT.
JUST RIGHT.

1410
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:32,552
HE'S GONE GENTLEMEN.

1411
01:28:40,059 --> 01:28:41,561
COLONEL BREWTON,
I HAVE NO IDEA.

1412
01:28:41,603 --> 01:28:43,062
ARE YOU SURE?

1413
01:28:43,104 --> 01:28:45,064
VERY SURE.

1414
01:28:50,069 --> 01:28:52,572
I WONDER HOW SHE'S
FIXED FOR MONEY.

1415
01:28:52,614 --> 01:28:55,074
MR. CAMERON LEFT
VERY LITTLE.

1416
01:28:55,575 --> 01:28:57,076
I SEE.

1417
01:29:04,584 --> 01:29:06,586
I MIGHT ADD ONE THING.

1418
01:29:07,086 --> 01:29:09,547
IF I DID KNOW WHERE YOUR WIFE WAS

1419
01:29:09,547 --> 01:29:12,091
YOU ARE THE LAST ONE I WOULD TELL.

1420
01:29:12,592 --> 01:29:14,594
WHY DON'T YOU
LEAVE HER ALONE NOW?

1421
01:30:35,633 --> 01:30:36,634
BROCK! BROCK!

1422
01:30:36,676 --> 01:30:38,636
WAIT A MINUTE, SISTER
LET THEM-LET THEM FINISH!

1423
01:30:38,678 --> 01:30:41,639
JEFF! JEFF! BROCK'S FIGHTING AGAIN!

1424
01:30:41,681 --> 01:30:42,640
JEFF!

1425
01:30:42,682 --> 01:30:44,642
BROCK! STOP THAT FIGHTING!

1426
01:30:44,684 --> 01:30:46,644
HEY, ED, I'M BETTING ON THE
CHAMBERLAIN KID!

1427
01:30:51,149 --> 01:30:52,150
WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID?

1428
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:54,652
YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.

1429
01:30:54,694 --> 01:30:57,155
I'M BETTING ON THE CHAMBERLAIN KID.
YOU WANT TO COVER MY BET?

1430
01:31:12,170 --> 01:31:13,671
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,
JEFF?

1431
01:31:15,673 --> 01:31:17,675
WHAT WAS SAID
HERE, BILL?

1432
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:23,681
IF ANYBODY'S GOT
ANYTHING TO SAY

1433
01:31:23,681 --> 01:31:25,183
NOW'S THE TIME
TO SAY IT.

1434
01:31:34,192 --> 01:31:35,651
COME ON, BROCK.

1435
01:32:14,690 --> 01:32:15,691
DON'T WORRY, LUTIE.

1436
01:32:16,192 --> 01:32:17,693
I'LL KEEP ON
WRITING TO YOU.

1437
01:32:18,194 --> 01:32:20,696
I KNOW YOU'VE TURNED TO ME
ONLY BECAUSE DOC REID IS GONE.

1438
01:32:20,738 --> 01:32:22,198
AND THAT YOU WANT
NOTHING FROM ME

1439
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:24,200
BUT NEWS OF YOUR CHILDREN.

1440
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:28,204
IN THIS LETTER, I'M SENDING
YOU A LIKENESS OF SARA BETH AND BROCK.

1441
01:32:28,246 --> 01:32:29,705
I OBTAINED IT BY DEVIOUS METHODS

1442
01:32:29,747 --> 01:32:31,707
FROM THE LOCAL
PHOTOGRAPHER.

1443
01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:37,213
YOU ASK
ABOUT BREWTON, LUTIE.

1444
01:32:37,255 --> 01:32:40,716
I KNOW VERY LITTLE
ABOUT HIM.

1445
01:32:40,758 --> 01:32:42,218
HE SELDOM COMES TO TOWN,

1446
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:46,722
EXCEPT TO DO SOME BUYING
FOR THE RANCH NOW AND THEN.

1447
01:32:54,730 --> 01:32:56,065
IT WOULD BREAK YOUR HEART

1448
01:32:56,065 --> 01:32:58,234
TO RIDE THROUGH THIS COUNTRY NOW, LUTIE.

1449
01:32:58,276 --> 01:33:02,238
IT'S ALL DRYING UP
AND BLOWING AWAY.

1450
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:06,242
BREWTON WAS RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING.
THIS LAND WAS NOT READY FOR THE PLOW.

1451
01:33:06,242 --> 01:33:08,744
IT NEEDED HELP FROM US.

1452
01:33:08,744 --> 01:33:11,247
DURING THOSE FIRST YEARS
WHEN THE RAINS CAME,

1453
01:33:11,247 --> 01:33:12,623
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT WORK

1454
01:33:12,623 --> 01:33:15,251
PLANNING AGAINST THE TIME
WHEN NATURE WOULD FAIL US.

1455
01:33:15,251 --> 01:33:17,753
WE SHOULD HAVE BUILT DAMS
AND BROUGHT OUR OWN RAIN

1456
01:33:17,753 --> 01:33:21,716
AND IRRIGATION DITCHES
AND CULVERTS AND DIVERTED STREAMS.

1457
01:33:22,216 --> 01:33:26,220
SOMEDAY WE WILL DO THESE THINGS
AND THE LAND WILL COME BACK.

1458
01:33:26,262 --> 01:33:29,223
THE HOPE OF SEEING THAT
KEEPS ME HERE.

1459
01:33:29,265 --> 01:33:31,726
AND SOMETHING ELSE
HOLDS ME, TOO.

1460
01:33:31,767 --> 01:33:33,853
BROCK IS GROWING UP, LUTIE,

1461
01:33:33,853 --> 01:33:36,731
AND THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING WORRIES ME.

1462
01:33:36,772 --> 01:33:39,233
WHEN SARAH WAS HOME,
SHE USED TO LOOK OUT FOR HIM.

1463
01:33:39,275 --> 01:33:40,735
BUT NOW THAT SHE'S AWAY
AT SCHOOL,

1464
01:33:40,776 --> 01:33:43,738
BREWTON MAKES NO MOVE
TO CURB BROCK IN ANYTHING.

1465
01:33:43,779 --> 01:33:47,742
IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH HE WERE TRYING
TO MAKE UP TO HIM FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

1466
01:33:48,242 --> 01:33:49,744
YOU, LUTIE.

1467
01:33:52,246 --> 01:33:55,249
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S BAD FOR BROCK AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

1468
01:33:58,753 --> 01:34:02,256
BUT I'M FORCED TO STAND BY
HELPLESS TO DO ANYTHING,

1469
01:34:02,298 --> 01:34:05,259
AND WATCH THE WILDNESS
IN THE BOY GROW STRONGER.

1470
01:34:08,763 --> 01:34:12,767
EVERYONE LIKES HIM.
MAYBE THAT'S THE TROUBLE.

1471
01:34:12,808 --> 01:34:14,226
HE'S RIGHT AT HOME EVERYPLACE.

1472
01:34:14,226 --> 01:34:16,771
WHETHER HE'S JOSHING THE
GIRLS AT CLANCY'S DANCE HALL,

1473
01:34:16,812 --> 01:34:20,775
OR PLAYING THE BLUE DANUBE
ON MYRA NETHERWOODS' NEW GRAND PIANO.

1474
01:34:20,816 --> 01:34:22,777
HE'S A PRIME FAVORITE.

1475
01:34:26,781 --> 01:34:29,784
BUT HE'S A WALKING
CONTRADICTION, TOO.

1476
01:34:29,825 --> 01:34:30,868
ONE DAY HE'LL BE DEALING

1477
01:34:30,868 --> 01:34:33,287
WESTERN EUCHRE FROM THE BEST
HORSEHAIR FURNITURE IN TOWN,

1478
01:34:33,788 --> 01:34:34,914
AND THE NEXT HE'LL BE PRANCING

1479
01:34:34,914 --> 01:34:36,791
UP AND DOWN THE STREETS IN
HIS NEW RED-WHEEL BUGGY

1480
01:34:37,291 --> 01:34:39,293
WITH A HOMESTEADER GIRL
BESIDE HIM.

1481
01:34:44,298 --> 01:34:46,300
YOU MAY SEE HIM BUYING OUT
A SHOWCASE OF JAWBREAKERS

1482
01:34:46,801 --> 01:34:50,805
AT THE KINGMAN MERCANTILE CO.
FOR A BUNCH OF RUNNY-NOSED KIDS,

1483
01:34:51,305 --> 01:34:52,306
GENTLE AS A WOMAN,

1484
01:34:52,807 --> 01:34:55,309
OR KEEPING A TOMATO CAN ROLLING
AT 50 FEET WITH A SIX-SHOOTER.

1485
01:34:59,814 --> 01:35:02,775
IT GIVES ME PAUSE, LUTIE,
TO SEE HIM.

1486
01:35:02,817 --> 01:35:06,278
THERE'S SUCH A LOT OF RECKLESSNESS
UNDER THAT CRAZY CHARM.

1487
01:35:06,779 --> 01:35:10,282
THERE'S A DANGER IN HIM
AND A KIND OF VIOLENCE.

1488
01:35:10,324 --> 01:35:13,285
IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO KEEP MY HANDS OFF.

1489
01:35:13,786 --> 01:35:15,955
SOMETIMES WHEN HE LOOKS AT ME AS WE PASS

1490
01:35:15,955 --> 01:35:18,290
THERE'S NEVER MORE THAN
A FLICK OF HIS EYE-

1491
01:35:18,332 --> 01:35:22,795
I FEEL THAT HE MUST KNOW SOMETHING,
AND THAT HE MUST HATE ME FOR IT.

1492
01:35:25,297 --> 01:35:29,301
I UNDERSTAND SARA BETH GRADUATED
LAST WEEK WITH HIGH HONORS.

1493
01:35:29,343 --> 01:35:30,803
SARAH BETH BREWTON.

1494
01:35:36,308 --> 01:35:37,309
HAZEL SAWYER.

1495
01:35:39,311 --> 01:35:41,814
THEY TELL ME
SHE'LL BE HOME SOON.

1496
01:35:41,855 --> 01:35:44,900
I WONDER HOW SALT FORK
WILL SEEM TO HER NOW

1497
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:46,819
AFTER HER YEARS OF SCHOOLING?

1498
01:35:57,329 --> 01:35:58,831
PARDON ME, MA'AM.

1499
01:36:01,834 --> 01:36:07,339
I'M LOOKING FOR A LITTLE, SAWED-OFF,
FRECKLED, UGLY RUNT OF A GIRL.

1500
01:36:07,381 --> 01:36:09,842
I'M LOOKING FOR
A HANDSOME YOUNG GENTLEMAN.

1501
01:36:09,883 --> 01:36:12,344
WELL, YOU FOUND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR, BUT HOW ABOUT ME?

1502
01:36:12,386 --> 01:36:14,346
YOU WENT AND
CHANGED ON US.

1503
01:36:14,388 --> 01:36:15,347
OH, BROCK!

1504
01:36:15,389 --> 01:36:16,348
HELLO, SARAH BETH.

1505
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:17,850
WHERE'S PAPA?

1506
01:36:17,891 --> 01:36:18,851
PAPA!

1507
01:36:19,351 --> 01:36:20,853
PAPA!

1508
01:36:24,857 --> 01:36:26,358
GOOD TO SEE YOU,
SARAH BETH.

1509
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:28,360
OH, I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN
YOU'D BE LIKE THIS, BOTH OF YOU.

1510
01:36:28,402 --> 01:36:29,862
LIKE WHAT?

1511
01:36:29,862 --> 01:36:31,363
OH, GOOD-LOOKING.

1512
01:36:38,370 --> 01:36:40,372
A COUPLE OF YEARS DO A LOT FOR
A YOUNG LADY, DON'T THEY?

1513
01:36:40,372 --> 01:36:43,375
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT-
OF ME, I MEAN?

1514
01:36:43,375 --> 01:36:45,377
NOT AS MUCH
AS WE GOT, EH, BROCK?

1515
01:36:45,377 --> 01:36:47,838
NOT HALF. I DON'T KNOW THOUGH.
LOOKS STUCK UP TO ME

1516
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,340
PROBABLY WON'T EVEN
LIKE OUR TOWN ANYMORE.

1517
01:36:49,381 --> 01:36:50,841
YOUR TOWN? MY TOWN.

1518
01:36:50,883 --> 01:36:53,844
OH HO. MAYBE YOU'LL DO,
HUH, COLONEL?

1519
01:37:04,354 --> 01:37:07,357
WELL, IT'S THE SAME OLD
PLACE. SAME...

1520
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:11,862
YEAH. WELL, I'M GONNA LEAVE
YOU HERE.

1521
01:37:11,904 --> 01:37:12,863
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1522
01:37:13,363 --> 01:37:15,365
RIGHT HERE. CHARLEY'S.
CARDS ARE PRETTY HOT FOR ME TODAY.

1523
01:37:15,407 --> 01:37:17,868
YOU BETTER NOT GET FRESH WITH
CHARLEY. HE CAN TEACH YOU.

1524
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:22,372
YEAH? CHARLEY SAID YOU WERE PRETTY
GOOD AT CARDS, BUT I WAS BETTER.

1525
01:37:22,414 --> 01:37:23,874
I CAN TAKE CHARLEY THE BEST
DAY HE EVER LIVED

1526
01:37:24,374 --> 01:37:25,375
WITH YOU STANDING
ON HIS SHOULDERS.

1527
01:37:25,417 --> 01:37:30,380
TRY IT ANYTIME YOU SAY, COLONEL,
ANYTIME AT ALL.

1528
01:37:33,383 --> 01:37:35,886
I'LL BET THE WOMEN
SPOIL HIM SILLY.

1529
01:37:35,928 --> 01:37:36,887
YEAH.

1530
01:37:36,929 --> 01:37:39,389
NOT ONLY THE WOMEN
EITHER.

1531
01:37:39,431 --> 01:37:41,892
JEFF SAYS HE CAN CHARM THE GOLD
RIGHT OUT OF YOUR TEETH.

1532
01:37:41,934 --> 01:37:44,394
HOW IS JEFF, PAPA?

1533
01:37:44,436 --> 01:37:46,396
WELL, HE'S LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE
AROUND HERE,

1534
01:37:46,897 --> 01:37:48,398
LOST HIS BITE.

1535
01:37:51,401 --> 01:37:53,403
NOT MUCH LIKE THE NIGHTGOWN YOU WORE
WHEN I PUT YOU TO BED.

1536
01:37:53,445 --> 01:37:54,905
OH, JEFF.

1537
01:37:56,448 --> 01:37:58,909
WELL, HOW DO YOU LIKE THE WAY
I FIXED UP YOUR ROOM, HONEY?

1538
01:37:58,951 --> 01:37:59,910
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1539
01:37:59,952 --> 01:38:01,912
AIN'T IT, THOUGH?

1540
01:38:02,412 --> 01:38:05,415
I GOT MY IDEA FROM ONE OF THEM
MAGAZINES.

1541
01:38:05,457 --> 01:38:07,417
WELL, IF YOU WANT
ANYTHING, YELL.

1542
01:38:07,459 --> 01:38:08,919
OH, DON'T GO.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

1543
01:38:08,961 --> 01:38:10,420
I WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT BROCK.

1544
01:38:10,462 --> 01:38:11,922
WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW?

1545
01:38:11,964 --> 01:38:14,925
OH, JUST HOW HE'S BEEN.
WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING.

1546
01:38:14,925 --> 01:38:18,428
SAME AS ALWAYS. BROCK'S BEEN HAVING
A GOOD TIME FOR BROCK.

1547
01:38:20,931 --> 01:38:22,432
WHAT YOU DOING?

1548
01:38:22,432 --> 01:38:24,434
WHERE'D THIS COME FROM?

1549
01:38:24,434 --> 01:38:26,937
I'VE BEEN SAVING IT.

1550
01:38:32,401 --> 01:38:34,403
WHY DON'T YOU ASK ME SOME MORE
QUESTIONS, SARAH BETH?

1551
01:38:34,903 --> 01:38:36,405
ABOUT WHAT?

1552
01:38:36,446 --> 01:38:39,908
ABOUT HER. AIN'T YOU CURIOUS ABOUT
YOUR MOTHER? YOU NEVER THINK OF HER?

1553
01:38:39,950 --> 01:38:41,410
WHAT FOR?

1554
01:38:41,451 --> 01:38:42,911
SHE'S YOUR MOTHER.

1555
01:38:42,953 --> 01:38:44,413
I DON'T KNOW
WHO SHE IS.

1556
01:38:44,454 --> 01:38:47,416
DON'T YOU EVER WONDER WHY
SHE'S NEVER COME TO SEE YOU?

1557
01:38:47,457 --> 01:38:48,917
YOU'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO SAY GOOD
THINGS ABOUT HER.

1558
01:38:49,418 --> 01:38:51,420
YOU'VE ALWAYS STUFFED YOUR EARS
WHEN I DID.

1559
01:38:51,461 --> 01:38:53,422
SHE GAVE UP A LOT WHEN SHE WENT AWAY.

1560
01:38:53,463 --> 01:38:55,424
AND SHE HASN'T GOT MUCH LEFT NOW.

1561
01:38:55,924 --> 01:38:57,426
HOW ABOUT PAPA?
HAS HE GOT ANYTHING LEFT?

1562
01:38:57,467 --> 01:38:58,427
HE'S GOT YOU.

1563
01:38:58,927 --> 01:38:59,928
HE'S GOT BROCK.

1564
01:38:59,970 --> 01:39:02,931
YEAH-BROCK.

1565
01:39:10,439 --> 01:39:12,441
PLEASE STOP WHISTLING.

1566
01:39:15,444 --> 01:39:16,945
10.

1567
01:39:18,947 --> 01:39:20,449
10. I'LL RAISE YOU 20.

1568
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:22,951
20.

1569
01:39:24,953 --> 01:39:25,954
3 TREYS.

1570
01:39:25,996 --> 01:39:27,956
3 DEUCES

1571
01:39:29,958 --> 01:39:31,460
YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT, BOY.

1572
01:39:31,501 --> 01:39:33,462
NOBODY CAN BEAT THAT, KID.

1573
01:39:33,503 --> 01:39:35,964
THAT'S RIGHT, CHARLEY.

1574
01:39:36,006 --> 01:39:40,469
NOBODY EVER HAS. YOU OUGHT
TO KNOW THAT, BILL.

1575
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:43,472
YEAH, I KNOW.

1576
01:39:46,475 --> 01:39:50,479
6. MISDEAL, ISN'T IT?

1577
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:51,980
OH, HAVE YOU GOT 6, TOO?

1578
01:39:52,022 --> 01:39:56,485
5. I COULD HAVE USED ANOTHER.

1579
01:39:56,485 --> 01:39:57,986
LOOK, KID, GAMBLING IS MY BUSINESS.

1580
01:39:57,986 --> 01:39:58,987
YEAH.

1581
01:39:59,488 --> 01:40:00,489
AND I KNOW MY BUSINESS.

1582
01:40:00,989 --> 01:40:02,991
AFTER THIS, IF I'VE GOT 6 CARDS,
I'LL MAKE IT KNOWN.

1583
01:40:02,991 --> 01:40:04,493
SURE. YOU BET.

1584
01:40:04,493 --> 01:40:05,494
YOU DEAL.

1585
01:40:05,494 --> 01:40:07,996
ANY OF YOU BOYS SEEN CHAMBERLAIN
AROUND? JUDGE CHAMBERLAIN?

1586
01:40:07,996 --> 01:40:08,997
NO. WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH HIM?

1587
01:40:08,997 --> 01:40:09,998
HIS OFFICE WANTS HIM.

1588
01:40:09,998 --> 01:40:10,999
TRY THE BANK.

1589
01:40:10,999 --> 01:40:13,001
FORGET IT, JOE.
HE DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

1590
01:40:13,502 --> 01:40:15,462
IT'S ALL RIGHT, CHARLEY.

1591
01:40:15,962 --> 01:40:17,964
ALL RIGHT, KID.
YOU'RE THE JUDGE.

1592
01:40:23,470 --> 01:40:24,471
JUDGE OF WHAT?

1593
01:40:24,513 --> 01:40:25,972
GO AHEAD. DEAL.

1594
01:40:36,483 --> 01:40:37,984
3, JUDGE.

1595
01:40:44,491 --> 01:40:46,493
THANK YOU, JUDGE.

1596
01:40:48,995 --> 01:40:50,497
3 FOR THE JUDGE.

1597
01:40:52,499 --> 01:40:54,000
$10.

1598
01:40:55,502 --> 01:40:56,503
I'LL LET YOU OFF WITH A LIGHT SENTENCE.

1599
01:41:00,006 --> 01:41:01,508
PAIR OF 9s.

1600
01:41:03,510 --> 01:41:05,011
PAIR OF DOGS.

1601
01:41:05,053 --> 01:41:08,515
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD A TWIN
BROTHER, JUDGE.

1602
01:41:22,028 --> 01:41:26,032
ALL RIGHT, BROCK, THE DOOR'S OPEN.
TEMPORARY ANYHOW.

1603
01:41:26,074 --> 01:41:28,034
WHO OPENED IT
FOR ME, BILL?

1604
01:41:31,037 --> 01:41:34,541
SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO SAY THANKS.

1605
01:41:34,583 --> 01:41:36,042
I DON'T KNOW THE PARTY.

1606
01:42:12,037 --> 01:42:15,540
BROCK, YOU'RE HOME!
PAPA, BROCK'S HOME.

1607
01:42:16,041 --> 01:42:17,542
WELL, WERE YOU STILL AS LUCKY?

1608
01:42:17,584 --> 01:42:19,544
OH, SURE.
I'M ALWAYS LUCKY.

1609
01:42:19,586 --> 01:42:21,046
STOP THAT.
PLAY SOMETHING ELSE.

1610
01:42:21,087 --> 01:42:22,047
LIKE?

1611
01:42:22,088 --> 01:42:24,049
OH, ANYTHING BUT
THAT FUNERAL MARCH.

1612
01:42:24,090 --> 01:42:25,050
PLAY SOMETHING WITH PEOPLE IN IT.

1613
01:42:27,052 --> 01:42:28,553
CAN'T HAVE A FUNERAL
WITHOUT PEOPLE.

1614
01:42:29,054 --> 01:42:30,055
HAD DINNER?

1615
01:42:32,057 --> 01:42:33,058
YEAH, ATE AT BEATTY'S PLACE
ON THE WAY OUT.

1616
01:42:33,558 --> 01:42:35,060
BROCK SAID HE WAS LUCKY AGAIN, PAPA.

1617
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:37,562
REALLY? THAT'S FUNNY.
LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE BOYS TOOK HIM.

1618
01:42:37,604 --> 01:42:40,565
THEY TRIED. I WAS PLAYING WITH
JOE HORTON.

1619
01:42:40,607 --> 01:42:43,568
HORTON? HE'S A BAD BOY. YOU
WANT TO LOOK OUT FOR HIM.

1620
01:42:43,610 --> 01:42:45,570
I DID, IN ONE HAND,
ESPECIALLY.

1621
01:42:45,612 --> 01:42:49,074
WE BOTH DREW ONE,
ONLY I DREW FIRST.

1622
01:42:49,115 --> 01:42:50,575
GOT HIM RIGHT
IN THE BELLY.

1623
01:42:50,617 --> 01:42:52,077
YOU MEAN
YOU SHOT HIM.

1624
01:42:52,118 --> 01:42:55,080
NOT CONCLUSIVELY.
HE'S GOING TO LIVE.

1625
01:42:55,121 --> 01:42:56,581
WHAT HAPPENED?
HOW'D THE FIGHT START?

1626
01:42:56,623 --> 01:42:59,084
AH, I HAD A FEW TOO MANY, I GUESS.
I DON'T REMEMBER.

1627
01:42:59,125 --> 01:43:00,585
I NEVER SAW YOU
THAT DRUNK.

1628
01:43:01,086 --> 01:43:02,587
THEN I'M A-LYIN'.

1629
01:43:02,629 --> 01:43:04,089
HOW LONG WERE YOU IN JAIL?

1630
01:43:04,130 --> 01:43:05,590
NOT LONG.

1631
01:43:05,632 --> 01:43:08,093
WHO GOT YOU OUT?
MCCURTIN?

1632
01:43:08,134 --> 01:43:10,095
HASN'T HE ALWAYS
BEFORE?

1633
01:43:10,136 --> 01:43:13,098
YEAH. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TELL
ME HOW THE FIGHT STARTED?

1634
01:43:13,598 --> 01:43:16,601
I TOLD YOU. I WAS DRUNK.

1635
01:43:16,643 --> 01:43:19,604
NOW, IF YOU'D RATHER I HADN'T
COME HOME, I'LL GET OUT.

1636
01:43:19,646 --> 01:43:21,606
I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T LIE, BROCK.

1637
01:43:21,648 --> 01:43:23,108
NOW, COME ON, LET'S GO
INTO TOWN.

1638
01:43:23,608 --> 01:43:24,609
AND FACE WHATEVER'S
GOT TO BE FACED.

1639
01:43:25,110 --> 01:43:26,611
NOT ME. I'M GOING
TO DENVER.

1640
01:43:26,611 --> 01:43:28,113
YOU'RE GOING TO SALT FORK,
BROCK,

1641
01:43:28,113 --> 01:43:30,615
AND GET THIS THING OVER WITH
AND THEN YOU'RE COMING BACK HERE.

1642
01:43:30,615 --> 01:43:32,117
AND IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA

1643
01:43:32,617 --> 01:43:35,120
IF YOU SPENT A LITTLE MORE TIME
HERE IN THE FUTURE.

1644
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:37,122
YOU CAN'T RUN ME
ANYMORE!

1645
01:43:37,122 --> 01:43:40,625
I WASN'T CUT OUT FOR LIVING YOUR WAY
AND I'M SICK OF TRYING.

1646
01:43:40,625 --> 01:43:42,585
I'D RATHER BE STUFFED
IN A COFFIN!

1647
01:43:44,087 --> 01:43:45,088
I DON'T MIND THE SHOOTING SO MUCH-

1648
01:43:45,588 --> 01:43:47,090
I WOULDN'T GIVE MUCH FOR YOU IF
YOU COULDN'T DEFEND YOURSELF-

1649
01:43:47,132 --> 01:43:50,093
BUT JUMPING BAIL IS ANOTHER THING.
IT ISN'T SQUARE.

1650
01:43:50,135 --> 01:43:53,096
I WANT YOU TO GO INTO TOWN
AND STAND TRIAL ON YOUR OWN FEET.

1651
01:43:53,138 --> 01:43:55,098
CLEAR YOURSELF OR TAKE
THE CONSEQUENCES.

1652
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:57,600
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO WORK IT OUT, BROCK.

1653
01:44:01,104 --> 01:44:04,107
WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING MORE
TO SAY TO ME, I'LL BE AROUND.

1654
01:44:09,112 --> 01:44:10,613
THAT WAS NICE.
THAT WAS FINE.

1655
01:44:10,655 --> 01:44:12,115
TAKE IT EASY.

1656
01:44:12,615 --> 01:44:13,616
YOU KNOW YOU CAN
HURT HIM MORE THAN ANYONE.

1657
01:44:13,658 --> 01:44:15,118
YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU?

1658
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:16,119
TAKE IT EASY, SARAH BETH.

1659
01:44:16,161 --> 01:44:17,620
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE LEAVING.

1660
01:44:17,662 --> 01:44:19,122
I GOT TO THINK.

1661
01:44:20,665 --> 01:44:24,127
HOW CAN A MAN THINK
WITHOUT A LITTLE MUSIC?

1662
01:44:24,169 --> 01:44:25,128
JIM HERE?

1663
01:44:25,170 --> 01:44:27,130
AROUND SOME PLACE.
OUT BACK, I GUESS.

1664
01:44:27,172 --> 01:44:28,631
WHERE'S BROCK?

1665
01:44:35,638 --> 01:44:38,141
HELLO, MR. MCCURTIN.

1666
01:44:38,183 --> 01:44:40,643
YOU TELL HIM ABOUT
THE SHOOTING, BROCK?

1667
01:44:40,685 --> 01:44:41,936
OH, HELLO, MACK.

1668
01:44:41,936 --> 01:44:44,647
SURE I TOLD HIM. WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1669
01:44:45,148 --> 01:44:46,649
HORTON DIED.

1670
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:50,153
FIGURED HE WAS
TOO MEAN TO DIE.

1671
01:44:50,194 --> 01:44:52,655
I CAN GET YOU OFF
ONCE MORE, MAYBE.

1672
01:44:52,697 --> 01:44:54,657
YOU MUST HAVE HAD A GOOD REASON
TO SHOOT A MAN.

1673
01:44:54,699 --> 01:44:56,159
YOU HAD ONE,
DIDN'T YOU?

1674
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:59,662
GOOD REASON?
WHY, SURE-THE BEST.

1675
01:44:59,704 --> 01:45:01,164
BETTER COME BACK IN WITH ME.

1676
01:45:01,205 --> 01:45:02,665
HAVE YOU TOLD
THE COLONEL?

1677
01:45:02,707 --> 01:45:05,168
I CAN'T FACE HIM.

1678
01:45:05,209 --> 01:45:07,670
I'VE GONE THAT ONE TIME OVER
BRINGING HIM BAD NEWS.

1679
01:45:07,712 --> 01:45:09,172
ARE YOU COMING?

1680
01:45:10,673 --> 01:45:12,175
NO.

1681
01:45:12,175 --> 01:45:14,177
THEN I'M FINISHED, BROCK,
AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED.

1682
01:45:14,177 --> 01:45:16,179
TOO MUCH FOR ME.

1683
01:45:16,179 --> 01:45:17,388
ONE LAST WORD-

1684
01:45:17,388 --> 01:45:20,183
I ADVISE YOU TO GET IN TOWN FAST.

1685
01:45:21,684 --> 01:45:23,645
SARAH BETH, TELL YOUR FATHER
I COULDN'T WAIT.

1686
01:45:23,686 --> 01:45:27,148
YOU CAN GET OUT OF THIS YOURSELF OR
THE WAY YOU GOT OUT OF JAIL.

1687
01:45:31,653 --> 01:45:33,655
WHAT DID MR. MCCURTAIN MEAN,
"THE WAY YOU GOT OUT OF JAIL"?

1688
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:35,156
HE GOT YOU OUT, DIDN'T HE?

1689
01:45:35,198 --> 01:45:36,157
NO.

1690
01:45:36,658 --> 01:45:37,659
WHO DID?

1691
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:40,161
CHAMBERLAIN.

1692
01:45:40,203 --> 01:45:42,163
I GUESS HE FIGURES
THE YOUNG AND FOOLISH

1693
01:45:42,205 --> 01:45:43,665
SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE,
OR SOMETHING.

1694
01:45:43,706 --> 01:45:45,667
ALL RIGHT, BROCK, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO COVER UP WITH ME.

1695
01:45:46,167 --> 01:45:47,168
I'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME.

1696
01:45:48,711 --> 01:45:49,671
WHEN?

1697
01:45:49,712 --> 01:45:51,172
FOR SURE WHEN I WAS 15.

1698
01:45:51,214 --> 01:45:52,173
HOW?

1699
01:45:52,215 --> 01:45:54,175
A LOT OF THINGS
PUT TOGETHER.

1700
01:45:54,217 --> 01:45:57,178
AND BEFORE I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL
THE LAST TIME, I KNEW YOU KNEW IT

1701
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:59,180
AND I KNEW PAPA DID.

1702
01:46:00,682 --> 01:46:03,184
I COULD KILL CHAMBERLAIN.

1703
01:46:07,188 --> 01:46:09,691
THAT'S WHAT THE
TROUBLE WAS ABOUT.

1704
01:46:09,732 --> 01:46:12,193
THIS FELLOW I WAS GAMBLING WITH,
HE SAID A FEW THING.

1705
01:46:12,235 --> 01:46:14,195
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T
TELL THE COLONEL.

1706
01:46:14,237 --> 01:46:16,197
I COULDN'T LET HIM
KNOW THAT I KNOW.

1707
01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:17,699
OH, BROCK.

1708
01:46:17,740 --> 01:46:20,201
WE'VE BEEN AROUND A LOT
TOGETHER, THE COLONEL AND ME.

1709
01:46:20,243 --> 01:46:23,037
AND HE NEVER LET ANYBODY
EVEN THINK ANYTHING ONCE,

1710
01:46:23,037 --> 01:46:24,205
AT LEAST NOT OUT LOUD.

1711
01:46:24,247 --> 01:46:26,207
DON'T I KNOW.

1712
01:46:26,249 --> 01:46:28,709
I'M GLAD I KNOW THAT, TOO-
I MEAN, THAT YOU LOVE HIM.

1713
01:46:28,751 --> 01:46:32,713
IF I HATED HIM,
I'D BE ALL RIGHT.

1714
01:46:32,755 --> 01:46:34,215
THEN WE COULD WALK DOWN
THE STREET TOGETHER

1715
01:46:34,257 --> 01:46:38,719
AND I WOULDN'T MIND FEELING
HIM CRINGE-NEVER LET ON.

1716
01:46:38,761 --> 01:46:42,223
OH, I SHOULD HAVE GONE Movie AWAY
FROM HERE A LONG TIME AGO.

1717
01:46:42,723 --> 01:46:44,725
BUT HE'S HARD TO LEAVE.

1718
01:46:46,227 --> 01:46:48,729
NOW I GOT TO GET
OUT OF HERE FAST.

1719
01:46:48,771 --> 01:46:49,730
DON'T RUN AWAY, BROCK.

1720
01:46:49,730 --> 01:46:51,732
MR. MCCURTIN COULD GET
YOU OFF, COULDN'T HE?

1721
01:46:51,732 --> 01:46:54,235
OH, SURE, EASY. THE JURY WOULDN'T
EVEN LEAVE ITS BOX.

1722
01:46:54,235 --> 01:46:56,237
THEN FACE IT LIKE
PAPA WANTS YOU TO.

1723
01:46:56,237 --> 01:46:57,738
EVER BEEN TO A TRIAL,
SARAH BETH?

1724
01:46:57,738 --> 01:47:01,742
LOTS OF THINGS COME OUT OF TRIALS.
WHOLE MESS COMES OUT.

1725
01:47:01,742 --> 01:47:05,246
SALT FORK WOULD EAT
THIS UP WITH A SPOON,

1726
01:47:05,246 --> 01:47:06,747
AND HE'S HAD ENOUGH.

1727
01:47:09,709 --> 01:47:13,713
GO ON, SARAH BETH, SIT DOWN AND
PLAY A TUNE BY YOURSELF.

1728
01:47:13,754 --> 01:47:15,715
YOU'LL HAVE TO GET USED TO IT.

1729
01:47:15,756 --> 01:47:18,217
AND TELL THE COLONEL NOTHING.

1730
01:47:32,231 --> 01:47:34,233
JEFF SAID MCCURTIN WAS HERE.
WHAT DID HE WANT?

1731
01:47:34,275 --> 01:47:35,234
NOTHING.

1732
01:47:35,276 --> 01:47:36,736
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1733
01:47:36,777 --> 01:47:38,237
FIRST LAP OF
MY TRIP TO DENVER.

1734
01:47:38,279 --> 01:47:39,739
GET DOWN OFF THAT HORSE, BROCK.

1735
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:41,240
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

1736
01:47:55,254 --> 01:47:59,759
WELL, SARAH BETH, I'LL TRY TO
UNDERSTAND WHY HE HAD TO GO.

1737
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:04,764
I DIDN'T TRY WITH SOMEONE
ELSE A LONG TIME AGO.

1738
01:48:04,805 --> 01:48:07,767
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SORRY.

1739
01:48:36,295 --> 01:48:38,297
WELL, COLONEL, THEN
IF BROCK AIN'T HERE

1740
01:48:38,297 --> 01:48:39,298
WE JUST GOTTA FIND HIM
AND TAKE HIM IN.

1741
01:48:39,298 --> 01:48:41,300
WHY?

1742
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:43,803
I THOUGHT MCCURTIN
TOLD YOU.

1743
01:48:43,803 --> 01:48:45,304
HORTON DIED.

1744
01:48:47,807 --> 01:48:49,809
SORRY, COLONEL.

1745
01:48:52,269 --> 01:48:54,271
THINGS FALL THAT WAY
SOMETIMES, BILL.

1746
01:48:54,772 --> 01:48:56,273
YEAH.

1747
01:48:57,775 --> 01:49:00,778
YOU SURE HE AIN'T HERE?

1748
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:01,779
YOU CAN LOOK.

1749
01:49:03,781 --> 01:49:09,787
I... I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED THAT,
COLONEL. GOOD NIGHT.

1750
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:24,802
WHY IS BROCK FRIGHTENED, SARAH BETH?

1751
01:49:24,802 --> 01:49:26,804
DOESN'T HE KNOW MACK CAN GET HIM OFF?

1752
01:49:26,846 --> 01:49:32,309
BUT HE KNOWS HE CAN'T GET
YOU OFF.

1753
01:49:32,351 --> 01:49:35,312
THE MAN BROCK SHOT,
HE CALLED BROCK NAMES.

1754
01:49:35,354 --> 01:49:37,815
NOT PRETTY NAMES,
EITHER.

1755
01:49:37,857 --> 01:49:41,819
THEY'D SOUND AWFUL AT A TRIAL,
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE TRUE.

1756
01:49:41,861 --> 01:49:46,824
BROCK THOUGHT-HE WANTED TO
SPARE YOU SOMETHING.

1757
01:49:48,325 --> 01:49:51,829
HE CAN'T SPARE ME
ANYTHING.

1758
01:49:51,871 --> 01:49:55,332
IT SEEMS NONE OF US CAN
SPARE THE OTHERS ANYTHING.

1759
01:49:58,335 --> 01:50:02,840
YOU GO TO BED.
I'VE GOT TO FIND HIM.

1760
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:06,343
I'VE GOT TO GET TO HIM
BEFORE HE DOES SOMETHING.

1761
01:50:06,844 --> 01:50:10,347
I'VE GOT TO GET TO HIM
BEFORE SOME SHERIFF GETS HIM.

1762
01:50:10,389 --> 01:50:11,849
HE'S A GOOD BOY,
SARAH BETH.

1763
01:50:11,891 --> 01:50:15,853
YES. I'M GLAD WE KNOW HOW GOOD.
YOU FIND HIM, PAPA.

1764
01:50:17,855 --> 01:50:18,856
I'LL FIND HIM.

1765
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:25,863
GET YOUR AFTERNOON STAR-
HERE'S YOUR CHANGE, LADY.

1766
01:50:28,866 --> 01:50:30,367
LATEAFTERNOON STAR.
THANK YOU, SIR.

1767
01:50:30,367 --> 01:50:32,369
RIGHT OVER HERE-
GET YOUR LATE AFTERNOON STAR!

1768
01:50:32,369 --> 01:50:35,831
AFTERNOON STAR! LATEST NEWS AND
THE LATEST PAPER!

1769
01:50:35,873 --> 01:50:37,333
RIGHT HERE. THAT THE IDEA.
THANK YOU, SIR.

1770
01:50:37,833 --> 01:50:38,626
LATE AFTERNOON STAR!

1771
01:50:38,626 --> 01:50:40,336
RIGHT OVER HERE! GET
YOUR LATE AFTERNOON STAR!

1772
01:50:46,842 --> 01:50:48,344
HERE COMES THE COLONEL.

1773
01:50:59,855 --> 01:51:01,357
HE'S IN THAT
CABIN, COLONEL.

1774
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:06,362
YOU CAN'T GO DOWN THERE, COLONEL!
THE BOY'S GONE CRAZY!

1775
01:51:31,387 --> 01:51:33,389
GO ON BACK!

1776
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:36,392
NO ONE'S TAKING ME, AND
THAT GOES FOR YOU, TOO!

1777
01:51:37,893 --> 01:51:40,396
STAY THERE, OR I'LL DROP
YOU! I MEAN IT!

1778
01:51:42,398 --> 01:51:45,401
YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO TURN AROUND!

1779
01:51:45,442 --> 01:51:47,903
I'LL COUNT 3!

1780
01:51:47,945 --> 01:51:49,405
1...

1781
01:51:52,408 --> 01:51:53,409
2...

1782
01:51:58,914 --> 01:51:59,915
3.

1783
01:52:11,927 --> 01:52:13,929
HURRY IT UP!

1784
01:52:34,908 --> 01:52:39,913
OH, DAD. WHY AM I
CALLING YOU DAD?

1785
01:52:39,955 --> 01:52:41,915
YOU USED TO CALL
ME THAT, BROCK.

1786
01:52:41,957 --> 01:52:44,918
NOT SINCE I GOT OLD
ENOUGH TO KNOW BETTER.

1787
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:47,421
GROWING UP-THAT'S
GREAT, ISN'T IT?

1788
01:52:47,463 --> 01:52:49,923
DON'T TALK.
DON'T TALK.

1789
01:52:49,965 --> 01:52:52,426
YOU DON'T SCARE
WORTH A NICKEL, DAD.

1790
01:53:00,934 --> 01:53:02,436
DOCS ALWAYS TRY SOMETHING.

1791
01:53:02,478 --> 01:53:03,937
LIE STILL, KID.

1792
01:53:03,979 --> 01:53:07,941
LIE STILL. NOT WHILE I'M STILL
BREATHING IN AND OUT.

1793
01:53:07,983 --> 01:53:10,444
LYING STILL COMES LATER.

1794
01:53:10,486 --> 01:53:12,946
NOT MUCH LATER, THOUGH,
HUH, DOC?

1795
01:53:14,448 --> 01:53:16,950
HELLO, SHERIFF!

1796
01:53:16,992 --> 01:53:18,452
SOMEBODY LEFT
A NOTE FOR YOU.

1797
01:53:18,952 --> 01:53:21,455
RIGHT SIDE OF YOU.

1798
01:53:44,478 --> 01:53:45,479
BROCK.

1799
01:53:50,984 --> 01:53:53,487
YOUR SISTER SENDS
HER LOVE, SON.

1800
01:53:53,487 --> 01:53:55,989
THE GOOD GIRL.

1801
01:53:55,989 --> 01:53:57,991
GOOD, BRIGHT GIRL.

1802
01:54:00,494 --> 01:54:02,955
SHE TOLD ME, BROCK.

1803
01:54:02,996 --> 01:54:06,458
SHE TOLD ME WHY YOU
DUCKED OUT.

1804
01:54:08,961 --> 01:54:11,964
AND, BROCK...

1805
01:54:12,005 --> 01:54:13,966
YOUR MOTHER...

1806
01:54:14,007 --> 01:54:15,467
THERE'S SOMETHING...

1807
01:54:15,509 --> 01:54:18,971
DAD, LET'S GO DOWN
TO CHARLEY'S, HMM?

1808
01:54:19,012 --> 01:54:22,474
LET'S DRINK ALL THE PLACE
UNDER THE TABLE.

1809
01:54:22,516 --> 01:54:24,977
AND THEN WHEN THERE'S
JUST ME AND YOU LEFT

1810
01:54:25,018 --> 01:54:26,979
I'LL DRINK YOU UNDER.

1811
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:28,981
ASK CHARLEY.

1812
01:54:30,983 --> 01:54:32,985
HOW ABOUT IT?

1813
01:54:35,988 --> 01:54:37,990
DA-DAD...

1814
01:54:41,493 --> 01:54:43,996
DAD.

1815
01:55:25,537 --> 01:55:27,539
I GOT IT FOR YOU,
LAST STOP, MA'AM.

1816
01:55:52,022 --> 01:55:53,523
GOT ANYTHING
FOR ME TO PICK UP?

1817
01:55:53,565 --> 01:55:55,025
NO. NOTHING TODAY.

1818
01:55:55,066 --> 01:55:56,526
I BEG YOUR PARDON, IS THERE
A TRAIN LEAVING

1819
01:55:56,568 --> 01:55:58,028
FOR SAN FRANCISCO TOMORROW?

1820
01:55:58,069 --> 01:55:59,529
ONE AT 11:00 O'CLOCK TONIGHT.

1821
01:55:59,571 --> 01:56:01,031
THANK YOU.

1822
01:57:06,096 --> 01:57:09,599
AND SO WE'LL COME TO
PAY OUR LAST RESPECTS

1823
01:57:09,599 --> 01:57:12,602
AND TO SAY GOODBYE
TO BROCK BREWTON

1824
01:57:12,602 --> 01:57:18,108
BELOVED SON OF JAMES BREWTON
AND LUTIE C. BREWTON.

1825
01:57:18,108 --> 01:57:22,112
THIS YOUNG MAN HAS
DEPARTED FROM OUR MIDST.

1826
01:57:22,112 --> 01:57:26,616
THE LORD GAVE.
THE LORD HATH TAKEN AWAY.

1827
01:57:26,616 --> 01:57:28,576
LET US PRAY.

1828
01:57:33,123 --> 01:57:34,082
COME IN.

1829
01:57:40,088 --> 01:57:42,590
JUST PUT THE COFFEE
ON THE TABLE, PLEASE.

1830
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:54,102
YOU'RE SARAH BETH.

1831
01:57:54,144 --> 01:57:54,853
YES.

1832
01:57:56,604 --> 01:57:58,106
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

1833
01:57:58,148 --> 01:57:59,607
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR THAT.

1834
01:57:59,649 --> 01:58:01,609
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, AND THEN
I'M GOING TO GO.

1835
01:58:01,651 --> 01:58:04,612
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS HERE?

1836
01:58:04,654 --> 01:58:07,615
I HAVE A ROOM AT THE HOTEL.
THE CLERK TOLD ME.

1837
01:58:07,657 --> 01:58:10,618
I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU HURT
POP ANYMORE!

1838
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:12,120
HE CAN'T STAND ANYMORE.

1839
01:58:12,162 --> 01:58:14,622
MAYBE YOU COULDN'T HURT HIM,
EVEN IF YOU TRIED.

1840
01:58:14,664 --> 01:58:16,624
MAYBE THERE'S NOT ANYTHING THAT
CAN HURT HIM,

1841
01:58:16,666 --> 01:58:18,126
NOT AFTER BROCK.

1842
01:58:18,168 --> 01:58:19,627
I HOPE SO.

1843
01:58:19,669 --> 01:58:21,629
BECAUSE NOBODY CAN STAND
ANYMORE, EVEN HIM.

1844
01:58:21,671 --> 01:58:24,132
SO MAYBE THE PAIN'S
OVER NOW.

1845
01:58:24,174 --> 01:58:25,133
UNLESS YOU BROUGHT HIM MORE.

1846
01:58:25,175 --> 01:58:26,134
HAVE YOU?

1847
01:58:26,634 --> 01:58:28,136
WHAT DO YOU
WANT OF HIM?

1848
01:58:30,138 --> 01:58:31,639
NOTHING.

1849
01:58:32,140 --> 01:58:35,643
I CAME TO HELP BROCK.

1850
01:58:35,685 --> 01:58:38,146
I DIDN'T KNOW HE-

1851
01:58:38,188 --> 01:58:42,150
I... I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL THE TRAIN
WAS ALMOST HERE.

1852
01:58:42,650 --> 01:58:45,153
I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO SEE
YOUR FATHER, SARAH BETH.

1853
01:58:46,696 --> 01:58:48,656
I MIGHT TRY IF I THOUGH
I COULD MAKE UP

1854
01:58:48,698 --> 01:58:51,159
A LITTLE TO HIM. AND TO YOU FOR
ALL THE YEARS,

1855
01:58:51,659 --> 01:58:53,661
BUT I KNOW I COULDN'T.

1856
01:58:54,162 --> 01:58:55,663
HE TRIED TO TELL ME
HOW HE FELT,

1857
01:58:55,663 --> 01:58:59,167
HOW THE GRASS WAS SOMEHOW
GODLY TO HIM.

1858
01:58:59,167 --> 01:59:02,670
HE TRIED TO TELL ME
AND I DIDN'T HEAR.

1859
01:59:03,171 --> 01:59:05,173
AND HE WAS RIGHT.

1860
01:59:07,175 --> 01:59:08,676
THOSE YEARS ARE GONE,

1861
01:59:09,177 --> 01:59:12,138
AND MY CHANCE WITH HIM.

1862
01:59:12,180 --> 01:59:15,141
I'LL LEAVE TONIGHT, SARAH BETH,

1863
01:59:15,642 --> 01:59:18,144
BUT I'M NOT SORRY
I CAME NOW,

1864
01:59:18,186 --> 01:59:19,646
BECAUSE I'LL TAKE SOMETHING
BACK WITH ME

1865
01:59:20,146 --> 01:59:22,649
WHICH MEANS
A GREAT DEAL TO ME:

1866
01:59:23,149 --> 01:59:25,652
THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT HE HAS YOU-

1867
01:59:26,152 --> 01:59:28,655
YOU TO FIGHT FOR HIM,

1868
01:59:28,696 --> 01:59:31,157
BE THERE WHEN HE NEEDS YOU,

1869
01:59:31,199 --> 01:59:35,161
TO BE WHAT I WASN'T
STRONG ENOUGH TO BE.

1870
01:59:35,662 --> 01:59:38,665
HE DIDN'T COME TO ST. LOUIS
FOR NOTHING.

1871
01:59:38,706 --> 01:59:41,668
AND NOW, WHEN HE'S LOST
IT ALL, EVERYTHING,

1872
01:59:41,709 --> 01:59:46,172
WHEN HE NEEDS SOMETHING
HUMAN AT LAST,

1873
01:59:46,673 --> 01:59:49,175
YOU COME INTO THE FIELD.

1874
01:59:49,217 --> 01:59:51,678
NO, HE DIDN'T COME
TO ST. LOUIS FOR NOTHING.

1875
01:59:52,178 --> 01:59:56,683
AND ALL AT ONCE
THAT GIVES ME... PEACE.

1876
01:59:57,183 --> 01:59:59,686
A KIND OF HAPPINESS EVEN.

1877
02:00:00,186 --> 02:00:03,690
I HAVEN'T FELT THAT
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

1878
02:00:05,692 --> 02:00:07,193
JUST ONE THING.

1879
02:00:07,694 --> 02:00:10,196
SOME NIGHT WHEN HE'S SITTING
ON THE PORCH, SARAH BETH,

1880
02:00:10,697 --> 02:00:12,699
GIVE HIM A KISS FROM ME.

1881
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:14,701
OH, DON'T...

1882
02:00:35,221 --> 02:00:37,724
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HOME, COLONEL.

1883
02:00:38,224 --> 02:00:39,225
THE BUCKBOARD WITH
SARAH BETH GET IN?

1884
02:00:39,225 --> 02:00:41,728
I MISSED SEEING HER START.

1885
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:44,230
MAYBE YOU'D BETTER
GO ON IN THE HOUSE, COLONEL.

1886
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:55,700
SARAH BETH?

1887
02:00:55,742 --> 02:00:58,202
PAPA, COME HERE.

1888
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:16,512
PAPA, COME HERE.

1889
02:01:16,512 --> 02:01:18,723
MOTHER WANTED TO BE
WAITING FOR YOU HERE, PAPA.

1890
02:01:18,765 --> 02:01:20,725
THE WAY SHE USED TO BE.

1891
02:01:40,244 --> 02:01:42,246
LUTIE?

1892
02:01:42,288 --> 02:01:44,248
YOU'RE WELL?

1893
02:01:44,290 --> 02:01:46,751
YES, JIM.

1894
02:01:46,793 --> 02:01:50,254
AND YOU?

1895
02:01:50,296 --> 02:01:54,258
YOU LOOK AS YOU ALWAYS DID.

1896
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:57,762
DO I, JIM?

1897
02:02:21,786 --> 02:02:23,287
PAPA.

1898
02:02:25,790 --> 02:02:29,293
IT WAS A HARD THING
FOR HER TO GO THROUGH,

1899
02:02:29,293 --> 02:02:31,796
BUT SHE'S ONE
IN A THOUSAND.

1900
02:02:31,796 --> 02:02:33,798
NO ONE ELSE WILL EVER BE LIKE HER.
