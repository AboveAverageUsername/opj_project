{1390}{1450}Neighbours heard them|screaming at each other,
{1452}{1488}Iike, for two hours.
{1490}{1562}Then they heard the gun|go off, both barrels.
{1564}{1622}Crime of passion.
{1624}{1656}Yeah.
{1658}{1728}Just look at all|the passion on that wall.
{1730}{1790}Yeah, well, it's a done deal,
{1792}{1829}all but the paperwork.
{1921}{1963}The kid see it?
{1965}{1992}What?
{1994}{2027}The kid.
{2029}{2102}What kind of fucking|question is that?
{2104}{2160}We are all going to be real glad
{2162}{2223}when we get rid of you,|Somerset.
{2225}{2264}It's always these questions.
{2266}{2308}Who gives a fuck?
{2310}{2366}He's dead. His wife killed him.
{2368}{2438}Anything else, it has|nothing to do with us.
{2616}{2689}Detective Somerset?
{2691}{2758}I'm Detective Mills.
{2760}{2821}Lieutenant, I apologise|for interrupting,
{2823}{2893}but I just get in town
{2895}{2926}they dump me here.
{2928}{2975}Look, um... Mills?
{2977}{3037}I thought we might|find a bar some place.
{3039}{3094}I'd like to get|to the precinct.
{3096}{3156}Not much time for|this transition thing.
{3158}{3214}I meant to ask you something
{3216}{3276}when we spoke|on the phone before.
{3278}{3311}Yep.
{3313}{3349}Why here?
{3351}{3387}I don't follow.
{3389}{3459}Well, all this effort|to get transferred.
{3461}{3502}It's the first question
{3504}{3550}that popped into my head.
{3552}{3621}I guess the same reasons as you,
{3623}{3670}the same reasons you had
{3672}{3732}before you decided|to quit, yeah?
{3734}{3780}You just met me.
{3782}{3863}Maybe I'm not understanding|the question.
{3897}{3933}It's very simple.
{3935}{4006}You actually fought|to get reassigned here.
{4008}{4077}I've just never seen it|done that way before.
{4079}{4125}I thought I could do some good.
{4127}{4174}Look. It would be great for me
{4176}{4221}if we didn't start out
{4223}{4269}kicking each other in the balls.
{4271}{4331}But you're calling|the shots, Lieutenant.
{4333}{4404}Yeah. I want you to look,
{4406}{4471}and I want you to listen, OK?
{4473}{4524}I wasn't guarding the Taco Bell.
{4526}{4571}I've worked homicide five years.
{4573}{4605}Not here.
{4607}{4639}I understand that.
{4641}{4686}Over the next|seven days, Detective,
{4688}{4750}you'll do me the favour|of remembering that.
{8893}{8980}You've got me closer to God
{10103}{10143}Hello.
{10145}{10181}Yep. OK.
{10218}{10254}Say it again.
{10304}{10349}I thought we moved here
{10351}{10406}to get away from tractor pulls.
{10529}{10570}Serpico's got to go.
{10572}{10604}Yeah. Well,
{10606}{10661}you might want to get rid of
{10663}{10719}this little crusty.|This eye, Serpico.
{10721}{10757}Did you get it?
{10759}{10792}Got it.
{11186}{11224}Coffee? No?
{11320}{11356}Nothing's been touched.
{11358}{11405}Everything's like I found it.
{11407}{11453}What time|was death established?
{11455}{11486}Like I said,
{11488}{11532}I didn't touch anything,
{11534}{11597}but he's got his face|in a plate of spaghetti
{11599}{11644}for about 45 minutes now.
{11646}{11702}No one bothers with vital signs?
{11704}{11741}Did I stutter?
{11743}{11779}This guy ain't breathing
{11781}{11836}unless he started|breathing spaghetti sauce.
{11838}{11885}So that's how it's done here.
{11887}{11942}This guy's been|sitting in a pile
{11944}{11989}of his own piss and shit.
{11991}{12062}If he wasn't dead,|he would have stood up by now.
{12064}{12100}Thank you, officer.
{12102}{12138}Thank you.
{12341}{12378}I wonder...
{12438}{12483}What exactly was the point
{12485}{12556}of the conversation|you were about to get into?
{12558}{12589}Don't know.
{12591}{12637}How many times has Barney Fife
{12639}{12699}found dead bodies|that weren't dead?
{12701}{12734}Drop it.
{13445}{13484}Somebody phone Guinness.
{13486}{13559}I think we've|got a record here.
{13948}{13994}Better homes and gardens.
{14225}{14299}Who said this was murder?
{14301}{14340}No one.
{14373}{14426}The guy's heart has got to be
{14428}{14475}the size of a canned ham.
{14534}{14594}If this isn't a coronary...
{14596}{14679}Ha ha! Well, I don't know.
{15070}{15108}Whoops!
{15271}{15323}How about that?
{15541}{15611}We had this case once...
{15613}{15672}Guy dead on the ground,
{15674}{15733}knife in his back.
{15735}{15779}Got to be murder, right?
{15804}{15840}Fuck.
{15842}{15913}Anyway, big insurance|policy involved, yeah?
{15915}{15979}The guy took|the tip of the blade,
{15981}{16039}stuck it in|his own shoulder blades.
{16041}{16115}He must have screwed up a|few times. There was multiples.
{16117}{16162}Could you please be quiet?
{16398}{16433}Wait a minute.
{16435}{16470}What?
{16524}{16569}Got a bucket here.
{16571}{16618}What's in it?
{16741}{16785}Oh, God!
{16787}{16829}Fucking vomit.
{16876}{16915}Any blood in it?
{16917}{16978}I didn't see any.|Help yourself.
{17113}{17166}Are you thinking it's poison?
{17168}{17197}Oh, wonderful.
{17199}{17248}Very moody.
{17250}{17291}Are you thinking|it's poison, Somerset?
{17293}{17361}You girls have got|forensics waiting outside.
{17363}{17432}I don't know|if we'll all fit, though.
{17434}{17501}There's room.|Light's the problem.
{17503}{17578}Detective Mills, would you|go help the officers
{17580}{17625}question the neighbours?
{17674}{17709}What?
{17711}{17799}Send in forensics|on your way out, please.
{18124}{18163}He's dead.
{18202}{18249}Thank you, Doctor.
{18345}{18392}You've seen my files, right?
{18394}{18439}You've seen|the things I've done.
{18441}{18509}No.
{18562}{18617}Well, I did my time|walking the beat.
{18619}{18693}I did that shit for a long time.
{18695}{18744}And?
{18746}{18844}My badge says Detective,|the same as yours.
{18846}{18885}Look. I made a decision.
{18887}{18967}I had to consider|the integrity of the scene.
{18969}{19024}Couldn't worry|whether you thought
{19026}{19078}you were getting enough time|on the playing field.
{19080}{19135}Hey, man...
{19137}{19182}Just don't jerk me off.
{19184}{19226}That's all I ask.
{19352}{19408}He's been dead a long time,
{19410}{19470}and I can tell you|it was not a poison.
{19472}{19510}Oh, man.
{19512}{19568}How does someone|let themselves go like that?
{19570}{19605}It took four orderlies
{19607}{19674}just to get him on the table.
{19676}{19711}But how'd the fat fuck
{19713}{19762}ever fit out his front door?
{19764}{19831}Please. It's obvious|he was a shut-in.
{19833}{19873}Now look at this.
{19875}{19926}See how big this stomach is?
{19928}{19988}And the strange thing is...|Stretches.
{19990}{20061}Here. Look at the size|of the cardiac orifice
{20063}{20094}where the food...
{20096}{20156}I see, but that means|nothing to me.
{20158}{20232}He's got lines of distension|across the duodenum,
{20234}{20303}and the interior wall|is ripped open.
{20305}{20372}This man ate till he burst?
{20374}{20420}He didn't really burst,
{20422}{20453}not all the way,
{20455}{20501}but he was haemorrhaging|internally.
{20503}{20559}There was a haematoma|in the rectus.
{20561}{20637}So he did die by eating.
{20639}{20675}Yes and no.
{20719}{20767}What about|these bruises up here?
{20800}{20856}I haven't figured that out yet.
{20858}{20905}Gun pressed against his head?
{20907}{20939}Pressed hard enough, sure.
{20941}{20971}Fuck, yeah.
{20973}{21019}The marks from the front side
{21021}{21066}flush with the muzzle.
{21068}{21115}Ladies and gentlemen,
{21117}{21173}we have ourselves a homicide.
{21236}{21307}Killer put a bucket beneath him,
{21309}{21353}kept on serving.
{21355}{21423}Coroner said this could have|gone on for more than 1 2 hours.
{21425}{21460}Victim's throat was swollen,
{21462}{21507}probably from the effort,
{21509}{21546}and there was definitely a point
{21548}{21581}when he passed out.
{21583}{21633}The killer kicked him,|and he burst.
{21635}{21682}Oof! Sadistic fucker, huh?
{21684}{21730}When you want somebody dead,
{21732}{21811}you don't risk the time|it takes to do this,
{21813}{21869}unless the act itself|has meaning.
{21871}{21907}Come on.
{21909}{21964}Somebody had a problem|with the fat boy
{21966}{22012}and decided to torture him.
{22014}{22084}In the grocery bags,|we found two receipts.
{22086}{22151}That means the killer|stopped in the middle
{22153}{22218}and made a second trip|to the supermarket.
{22220}{22253}So?
{22255}{22294}Hey, man... It's his thing.
{22296}{22337}I've been out|in the rain all day.
{22339}{22386}This is beginning.
{22388}{22435}We've got one dead guy,|not three.
{22437}{22467}No motive.
{22469}{22550}Don't even start|your big brain cooking on this,
{22552}{22592}all right? Please.
{22594}{22663}I'd like to be reassigned.
{22665}{22705}What? Whoa.
{22707}{22755}What in the hell|are you talking about?
{22757}{22803}This can't be my last duty.
{22805}{22853}It's just going|to go on and on.
{22855}{22889}You're retiring.
{22891}{22973}Six more days|and you're all the way gone.
{22975}{23042}Won't be the first time|you've left unfinished business.
{23044}{23116}Those cases were taken as close|to conclusion as possible,
{23118}{23174}and if I may speak freely...
{23176}{23216}This should not be|his first assignment.
{23218}{23259}I knew it.
{23261}{23318}This is not|my first assignment, you dick.
{23320}{23347}It's too soon.
{23349}{23427}I'm here. You can say|that shit to my face.
{23429}{23460}It's too soon.
{23462}{23532}Captain, if we can|just talk in private.
{23534}{23597}This isn't working.|It's a personal thing.
{23599}{23641}Shut up, Mills.
{23643}{23724}Look. I don't have|anyone else to put on this.
{23726}{23765}This is Metro.
{23767}{23825}You don't just get to swap.
{23827}{23868}Give it to me.
{23870}{23908}Fuck him.
{23910}{23952}See you later.
{23954}{23980}Give it to me.
{23982}{24030}I'm putting you|on something else.
{24093}{24149}Go on, Mills. Just go on.
{24282}{24328}I'm sorry, old buddy,
{24330}{24451}but it looks like you're stuck|cleaning up the fat man.
{24832}{24879}All right. Here we go.
{24881}{24913}Quiet down.
{24915}{24947}All right. Calm down.
{24949}{24985}Calm down.
{24987}{25022}Quiet down!
{25024}{25071}Calm down. Quiet down.
{25073}{25153}Now, here's how|it's going to be.
{25155}{25211}I'll answer questions|for 1 0 minutes.
{25213}{25268}If those questions do not come
{25270}{25321}in a calm, sane,|and orderly fashion,
{25323}{25373}I'm on my way out of here.
{25375}{25407}Detective.
{25409}{25466}Can I have|a moment of your time?
{25590}{25647}I will not discuss the details
{25649}{25708}of this ongoing investigation.
{25826}{25863}There he is.
{25865}{25961}That's the guy.
{25963}{25994}It looks like
{25996}{26035}we won't be eating dinner.
{26037}{26093}Who is this kid,|anyway? Hotshot.
{26152}{26207}What have you guys got for me?
{26209}{26257}Nothing yet, boss.
{26306}{26351}Why don't you guys, uh...
{26353}{26415}Go get a coffee, OK?
{26417}{26472}We have|this breaking story for you.
{26474}{26535}We're going|to go live downtown
{26537}{26596}where Defence Attorney|Eli Gould
{26598}{26645}was found murdered|this morning.
{26647}{26692}District Attorney|Martin Talbot
{26694}{26749}is taking questions|from reporters.
{26751}{26822}There's a conflict of interest|between your office...
{26824}{26917}That is ridiculous to the point|of being offensive.
{26919}{26984}There is no conflict|whatsoever.
{26986}{27076}Is it true that you're far|from apprehending a suspect?
{27078}{27168}I've just come from a meeting|of law enforcement officials,
{27170}{27214}and they've assured me
{27216}{27275}they have|their very best men on this.
{27277}{27354}This will be|the very definition
{27356}{27414}of swift justice.
{27984}{28030}Pardon me, George.
{28128}{28159}Somerset.
{28161}{28198}Come in.
{28200}{28248}Have you heard the news?
{28250}{28285}Nope. Haven't heard.
{28287}{28342}Eli Gould was found|murdered this morning.
{28344}{28404}Someone broke into his law firm
{28406}{28463}and bled him to death,
{28465}{28542}wrote the word "Greed"|on the floor.
{28646}{28677}Greed?
{28679}{28720}Yeah. In blood.
{28722}{28778}Mills is heading up|the investigation.
{28780}{28812}Uh, excuse me.
{28814}{28839}Excuse me.
{28841}{28897}Could you not do that, please?
{28899}{28949}Oh, OK.
{28951}{28989}Well, good for him.
{28991}{29085}What in the hell are you|going to do with yourself
{29087}{29133}out there, Somerset?
{29135}{29195}Oh, I'll work,|maybe on a farm,
{29197}{29228}fix my house.
{29230}{29277}Don't you feel that feeling?
{29279}{29349}You're not going to be|a cop any more.
{29351}{29411}That's the whole idea.
{29413}{29478}I don't think you're leaving.
{29480}{29541}Hell, you can't leave all this.
{29591}{29654}A guy's out walking his dog,
{29656}{29684}gets attacked.
{29686}{29757}His watch is taken, his wallet.
{29759}{29799}While he's lying there
{29801}{29848}on the sidewalk helpless,
{29850}{29939}his attacker|stabs him in both eyes.
{29941}{29991}This happened just last night
{29993}{30029}about four blocks from here.
{30031}{30079}Yeah, I read about it.
{30081}{30145}I don't understand|this place any longer.
{30147}{30195}It's the way it's always been.
{30197}{30233}Maybe you're right.
{30235}{30293}You were made for this work,
{30295}{30362}and I don't think|you can deny that.
{30364}{30405}Maybe I'm wrong.
{30467}{30537}The coroner sent|this down for you.
{30539}{30598}Found them|in the fat boy's stomach
{30600}{30646}mixed in with the food.
{30648}{30686}Looks like plastic.
{30688}{30732}Set them on the desk, please.
{30834}{30900}They were, uh...|They were fed to him.
{33285}{33346}Oh, Lord.
{33514}{33570}This was found on the wall
{33572}{33614}behind the refrigerator
{33616}{33657}at the obesity murder scene.
{33659}{33695}" Long is the way and hard
{33697}{33771}that out of hell|leads up to light."
{33773}{33818}It's from Milton.
{33820}{33858}Paradise Lost.
{33860}{33891}All right.
{33893}{33920}I'm confused.
{33922}{33993}It means that|this is beginning.
{33995}{34070}This was found behind|the same refrigerator,
{34072}{34126}written in grease.
{34128}{34185}There are seven deadly|sins, Captain -
{34187}{34219}gluttony...
{34278}{34313}greed...
{34365}{34482}sloth, wrath,|pride, lust...
{34484}{34520}and envy.
{34522}{34554}Seven.
{34590}{34648}This is not even my desk.
{34650}{34722}You can expect|five more of these.
{34762}{34818}Now wait a minute.
{34820}{34881}I can't get|involved in this.
{34924}{34955}Somerset!
{34957}{34996}He wanted it.
{35069}{35124}I'm all over it.
{35898}{35973}Where you headed?
{36028}{36085}Far away from here.
{36292}{36337}Thanks, George.|How you doing?
{36339}{36366}OK.
{36368}{36423}I've got two things to look up.
{36425}{36472}OK. Sit where you'd like.
{36474}{36522}How's everybody?
{36524}{36567}Hi there, Smiley.
{36569}{36640}Come on, George.|Your cards are getting cold.
{36642}{36698}Duty calls.
{37073}{37120}Gentlemen, gentlemen.
{37122}{37170}I'll never understand.
{37172}{37246}All these books...
{37248}{37308}A world of knowledge|at your fingertips.
{37310}{37350}What do you do?
{37352}{37395}You play poker all night.
{37397}{37452}Hey, we got culture!
{37454}{37534}Yeah. We got culture|coming out our ass.
{37536}{37574}All right!
{37576}{37646}How's this for culture?
{41418}{41464}Yo, Smiley.
{41466}{41555}You really going to miss us.
{41557}{41603}I just might.
{42985}{43032}Fucking Dante.
{43034}{43104}Goddamned poetry-rhyming faggot
{43106}{43153}piece of shit!
{43155}{43201}Fucker!
{43334}{43362}Yeah.
{43364}{43406}Yeah?
{43450}{43492}Good work, officer.
{43651}{43691}Thank you, Lord.
{43872}{43919}Oh. Sorry.
{43957}{44027}Be out of your way in a second.
{44280}{44326}You want your chair?
{44328}{44375}No. You go right ahead.
{44377}{44407}Yeah?
{45304}{45343}Phone.
{45345}{45381}It's a package deal.
{45383}{45427}It comes with the office.
{45545}{45584}Mills.
{45586}{45653}Are you OK?|ls something wrong?
{45655}{45687}You dingleberry.
{45689}{45782}I told you not to call me|at work.
{45784}{45835}Yeah. Why?
{45837}{45871}Why?
{45909}{45961}Why?
{46055}{46087}OK.
{46177}{46210}It's my wife.
{46212}{46250}Sorry?
{46252}{46316}She'd like to speak to you.
{46537}{46606}Uh, this is Detective Somerset.
{46639}{46718}Well...it's nice|to talk to you, too.
{46720}{46811}I appreciate the offer, but...
{46877}{46949}Well, in that case,|I'd be delighted.
{46951}{47022}Yes, thank you very much.
{47024}{47073}Bye.
{47121}{47152}Hon, what...
{47333}{47357}Well?
{47359}{47389}Sorry?
{47391}{47420}Well?
{47422}{47453}I've been invited
{47455}{47525}to a late supper|at your apartment.
{47527}{47564}I accepted.
{47566}{47597}My...how's that?
{47599}{47632}Tonight.
{47798}{47840}Hello, men.
{47842}{47883}Hi, loser.
{47885}{47945}Hi, idiot.
{47947}{48020}This is Trace. Tracy, Somerset.
{48022}{48059}Hello.
{48061}{48146}Happy to meet you.|I've heard a lot about you.
{48148}{48225}Except, of course,|your first name.
{48227}{48263}It's William.
{48265}{48329}Hmm. It's a good name, William.
{48331}{48425}William, I'd like you|to meet David.
{48427}{48467}David, this is William.
{48469}{48540}I'll be right back.|How are the kids?
{48542}{48588}Good. They're in their room.
{48590}{48625}Come on in.
{48627}{48670}Oh, good dogs!
{48672}{48723}How are the good dogs?
{48797}{48842}How are you?
{49010}{49043}Smells good.
{49045}{49068}What?
{49070}{49107}The...
{49109}{49167}Oh, yeah. I mean thank you.
{49169}{49213}Um, please, have a seat.
{49215}{49275}Would you like|something to drink?
{49277}{49348}Uh, no. No, thanks. I'll wait.
{49350}{49392}Just throw that anywhere.
{49394}{49428}Excuse all this mess.
{49430}{49471}We're still unpacking.
{49525}{49595}I understand you two|were high-school sweethearts.
{49626}{49673}Pretty hokey, huh?
{49675}{49779}I knew on our first date|that this was the guy
{49781}{49831}I was going to marry.
{49833}{49871}Really?
{49873}{49968}He was the funniest guy|I'd ever met.
{50073}{50102}Really?
{50154}{50234}Well, it's kind of rare|nowadays, you know...
{50236}{50316}I mean, that level|of commitment.
{50429}{50461}Oh, don't worry.
{50463}{50537}I won't wear it|to the dinner table.
{50539}{50568}I, uh...
{50570}{50640}No matter how often I see guns,
{50642}{50714}I just...l can't|get used to them.
{50716}{50764}Same here.
{50982}{51033}Why aren't you|married, William?
{51035}{51074}Oh, Trace.
{51076}{51109}What the hell.
{51111}{51205}I was close once.|Just didn't happen.
{51207}{51252}It surprises me.
{51254}{51320}It really does.
{51322}{51362}Well...
{51364}{51400}Anyone who spends
{51402}{51471}a significant|amount of time with me
{51473}{51516}finds me disagreeable.
{51518}{51557}Just ask your husband.
{51559}{51615}Very true. Very, very true.
{51617}{51697}So how long have you lived here?
{51699}{51750}Too long.
{51843}{51903}How do you like it here?
{51905}{51951}You know,
{51953}{52035}takes time to settle in.
{52037}{52083}It'll be good.
{52085}{52146}You get numb after a while.
{52182}{52242}There are things to any city...
{52342}{52373}The subway.
{52375}{52434}It'll go away in a minute.
{52436}{52468}It's nothing.
{52527}{52571}That real-estate guy.
{52573}{52632}Fucking piece of...|Sorry, hon.
{52634}{52704}Shows us the place a few times.
{52706}{52777}I think it's good.|Trace likes it.
{52779}{52815}Then I start wondering
{52817}{52880}why he only brings us here
{52882}{52924}five minutes at a time.
{52926}{52980}We found out the first night.
{52982}{53089}The soothing, relaxing,|vibrating home, huh?
{53305}{53353}I'm sorry.
{53498}{53558}Yeah, all right, laugh it up.
{53602}{53680}I don't know what|you're laughing at.
{53768}{53814}All right already.
{53868}{53961}The guy had to get in|before the office was closed
{53963}{54001}and security tightened.
{54003}{54058}Gould would have|been working late.
{54060}{54142}I'm certain. He was|the biggest lawyer in town.
{54144}{54176}Infamous, really.
{54178}{54239}The body was found|Tuesday morning.
{54241}{54286}The office was closed Monday.
{54288}{54359}The guy could have|gotten in on Friday
{54361}{54446}and had his way|all day Saturday, Sunday,
{54448}{54484}maybe even Monday.
{54486}{54526}Look at this.
{54528}{54592}Gould was bound,|his right arm free.
{54594}{54682}He was handed|a butcher's knife.
{54684}{54726}Check out the scale.
{54728}{54770}A pound of flesh?
{54772}{54807}Yeah.
{54926}{54966}"One pound of flesh,
{54968}{55004}" No more, no less.
{55006}{55077}" No cartilage, no bone,|but only flesh."
{55079}{55119}Merchant of Venice.
{55121}{55151}Didn't see it.
{55153}{55217}" His task done,|then he would go free."
{55219}{55277}That chair was soaked|with sweat.
{55279}{55315}Of course.
{55317}{55373}The killer would have|wanted Gould
{55375}{55413}to take his time,
{55415}{55514}to sit and decide|which cut to make first.
{55516}{55589}Imagine it. There's|a gun in your face.
{55591}{55664}Which part of your body|is expendable?
{55666}{55719}How about the love handle?
{55721}{55821}Cut along the side|of his own stomach.
{55823}{55903}All right, let's take|a fresh look at these.
{55905}{55965}Even though|the corpse is there,
{55967}{56011}I looked through it.
{56013}{56088}The trick is to find|one item, one detail,
{56090}{56132}and focus on it
{56134}{56177}until it's an exhausted|possibility.
{56179}{56243}I'm going to get|another beer. Beer?
{56245}{56302}Wine, please.
{56474}{56543}He's preaching.
{56545}{56596}He's punishing.
{56598}{56674}The sins were used|in medieval sermons.
{56676}{56726}There were seven|cardinal virtues
{56728}{56771}and seven deadly sins
{56773}{56812}used as teaching tools.
{56814}{56909}Like in The Parson's Tale,|and what's-his...oh, Dante.
{56911}{56944}You read them.
{56946}{56983}Yeah. Well, parts.
{56985}{57030}Hey, remember in Purgatory,
{57032}{57071}Dante and his buddy,
{57073}{57119}they're climbing up the hill,
{57121}{57182}checking out all|the sinners, yeah?
{57184}{57239}Yeah. The seven terraces|of purgation.
{57241}{57302}Right, but there,|pride comes first,
{57304}{57338}not gluttony.
{57340}{57380}Well, for now,
{57382}{57455}Iet's consider that the books|were the inspiration.
{57457}{57526}The sermons were about|atonement for sin.
{57528}{57582}These murders are like|forced attrition.
{57584}{57617}Forced what?
{57619}{57674}Attrition. It's when|you regret your sins
{57676}{57738}but not because you love God.
{57740}{57772}Oh, like because|someone's sticking
{57774}{57826}a fucking gun in your face.
{57884}{57911}No fingerprints.
{57913}{57951}Nope.
{57953}{57984}Totally unrelated victims.
{57986}{58008}Yup.
{58010}{58071}And no witnesses of any kind.
{58073}{58183}Which I don't get because|the fucker had to get back out.
{58185}{58244}Well, in any major city,
{58246}{58315}minding your own|business is a science.
{58317}{58389}First thing they teach women|in rape prevention
{58391}{58437}is never cry for help.
{58439}{58486}Always yell " Fire."
{58488}{58532}Nobody answers to " Help."
{58534}{58582}Holler " Fire,"|They come running.
{58584}{58625}That's fucked up.
{58627}{58689}Must have left|another puzzle piece.
{58732}{58813}You know what? Thank you|for talking this out,
{58815}{58883}but I got to sleep,|walk the dogs.
{58885}{58944}This is to satisfy my curiosity.
{58946}{59030}I'm still leaving|at the end of the week.
{59032}{59077}Aw, shit. Wait, wait.
{59079}{59133}Gould's wife was out of town,
{59135}{59187}except this means|she saw something.
{59189}{59235}What if it's a threat?
{59237}{59297}I put her in a safe house.
{59299}{59345}She wasn't happy about it.
{59482}{59558}What if it isn't|something she has seen
{59560}{59623}but something|she's supposed to see
{59625}{59687}but hasn't been given a chance?
{59689}{59731}Yeah, OK. What?
{59733}{59777}I don't know.
{59817}{59868}But that's the one thing.
{60944}{60983}Sign us in.
{60985}{61046}We've got to see Mrs Gould.
{61096}{61182}We want you to have|a phone line, but...
{61184}{61258}Mrs Gould?
{61357}{61403}Mrs Gould, I am sorry.
{61405}{61437}I truly am.
{61439}{61499}I don't understand.
{61501}{61569}I need you to look at each photo
{61571}{61616}very carefully.
{61618}{61684}Look and see if there's anything
{61686}{61737}strange or out of place,
{61739}{61774}anything at all.
{61776}{61829}I don't see anything.
{61831}{61847}You sure?
{61849}{61912}I can't do this right now!
{61914}{61945}OK.
{61947}{62003}It's got to be now.
{62005}{62069}There may be something|we haven't seen.
{62275}{62308}Wait.
{62310}{62332}What?
{62334}{62369}Here.
{62444}{62515}This painting, it's upside down.
{62686}{62733}Your men didn't move this?
{62735}{62770}No, no, no.
{62772}{62829}Those shots were taken|before forensics.
{62896}{62942}Nothing.
{62944}{63010}There's got to be something.
{63247}{63316}Moved the screws to rehang it.
{63318}{63349}Yep.
{63426}{63497}What the fuck is that?
{63499}{63544}Switchblade.
{63736}{63785}Goddamn it!
{63857}{63913}Must be something.
{64026}{64092}He didn't paint|the fucking thing.
{64287}{64333}Now he's fucking with us.
{64335}{64381}That's what he's doing.
{64383}{64436}See this? This is us.
{64438}{64467}Yeah.
{64469}{64517}Just wait a minute.
{64561}{64621}Now Somerset's climbing|on the furniture.
{64623}{64670}Just wait a minute.
{64799}{64841}You're kidding me.
{64843}{64908}Call the print lab.
{65011}{65072}Oh, man.
{65135}{65191}Honestly, have you ever seen
{65193}{65234}anything like this?
{65284}{65330}No.
{65332}{65378}I can tell you guys
{65380}{65437}just by looking|at the swirl pattern,
{65439}{65494}they're not the victim's|fingerprints.
{65741}{65792}I don't know, man.
{65794}{65857}I'd say he's whacked enough.
{65859}{65892}Doesn't fit.
{65894}{65963}He doesn't want us|to help him stop.
{65965}{66002}Who knows?
{66004}{66059}Freaks out there|doing evil deeds
{66061}{66103}they don't want to do.
{66105}{66213}" Voices made me do it.|Jodie Foster told me to do it."
{66215}{66275}I've seen this take three days
{66277}{66316}to make a match,
{66318}{66411}so maybe you want to cross|your fingers somewhere else.
{66459}{66563}You meant what you said|to Mrs Gould, didn't you,
{66565}{66612}about catching this guy?
{66660}{66744}I wish I still thought|the way you do.
{66746}{66793}Why don't you tell me
{66795}{66841}what the hell it is
{66843}{66881}you think we're doing?
{66883}{66937}Picking up the pieces.
{66939}{66994}We're collecting|all the evidence,
{66996}{67066}taking all the pictures|and samples,
{67068}{67198}writing everything down,|noting the time things happen.
{67200}{67245}That's all?
{67247}{67284}That's all.
{67286}{67342}Putting everything|into neat little piles
{67344}{67389}and filing it away
{67391}{67428}on the off chance
{67430}{67475}it will ever be needed
{67477}{67524}in the courtroom.
{67526}{67572}Picking up diamonds
{67574}{67624}on a deserted island,
{67626}{67708}saving them in case|we get rescued.
{67770}{67804}Bullshit.
{67850}{67906}Even the most promising clues
{67908}{67977}usually only lead to others.
{67979}{68082}So many corpses|roll away unrevenged.
{68151}{68197}Don't try to tell me
{68199}{68254}you didn't get|that rush tonight.
{68256}{68302}I assure you.
{68304}{68361}We're getting somewhere.
{68719}{68776}Wake up, glimmer twins.
{68778}{68831}You've got a winner.
{68972}{69038}This guy goes by the name|of Victor.
{69040}{69096}His real name is Theodore Allen.
{69098}{69153}His prints were found|by homicide.
{69155}{69220}He's got a long history|of mental illness.
{69222}{69317}His parents gave him a strict|southern baptist upbringing,
{69319}{69368}but somewhere they fell short.
{69370}{69427}Victor dabbled in drugs,|armed robbery, assault,
{69429}{69533}spent time in prison here|for attempted rape of a minor,
{69535}{69622}but his lawyer saw to it|that didn't last long.
{69624}{69705}His lawyer was Eli Gould,|the greed murder victim.
{69707}{69757}We're going|to finish this today.
{69759}{69804}Victor's been|out of circulation,
{69806}{69873}but there's still|a residence in his name.
{69875}{69932}You're not buying this, are you?
{69934}{69976}Doesn't seem like our guy.
{69978}{70011}You tell me.
{70013}{70082}Our killer seems|to have more purpose.
{70756}{70811}You ever take a bullet?
{70813}{70885}Never in my 34 years,|knock wood.
{70887}{70966}I've only taken|my gun out three times
{70968}{71023}with the intention of using it.
{71025}{71069}Never pulled the trigger.
{71071}{71105}Not once.
{71107}{71136}You?
{71138}{71216}Yeah, but...no,|I never took a bullet,
{71218}{71301}but I pulled my gun once,|shot it once.
{71303}{71330}Really?
{71332}{71399}It was my first one of these.
{71401}{71480}I was shaky going in.|I was a rookie.
{71482}{71559}We bust open the door|looking for this junkie,
{71561}{71605}and the fucker opened fire.
{71607}{71678}One cop got hit in the arm.
{71680}{71782}Christ, what was his name?
{71784}{71837}Spun him like a top.
{71839}{71913}You know? I mean,|more like slow motion.
{71915}{72005}I remember...
{72007}{72059}Riding in that ambulance.
{72061}{72134}Well, he died right there.
{72136}{72175}Right there.
{72177}{72245}Christ, what was|his fucking name?
{74105}{74163}Swat goes before dicks.
{74165}{74202}Here.
{74253}{74312}They love this.
{74314}{74348}Police!
{74465}{74500}Clear!
{74864}{74891}Clear!
{75083}{75130}Good morning, sweetheart.
{75132}{75185}Get up now, motherfucker.
{75187}{75229}Now!
{75432}{75494}Get up, you sack of shit.
{75653}{75686}Oh, fuck me.
{75688}{75720}Dicks!
{75722}{75796}You want to come|take a look at this!
{75866}{75904}Dicks!
{76065}{76095}Jesus.
{76097}{76129}Victor?
{76131}{76181}That's just Victor.
{76183}{76227}Call an ambulance.
{76229}{76261}A hearse.
{76263}{76326}Get your people out of here.
{76328}{76350}Go!
{76352}{76400}No one touches anything!
{76402}{76474}Some kind of freaking|wax sculpture or something.
{76522}{76569}"Sloth."
{76801}{76830}Oh, man.
{76832}{76863}Goddamn.
{76865}{76950}This picture was dated|three days ago.
{77112}{77189}This must be|the first one. Look.
{77191}{77269}It's dated exactly|one year ago today.
{77318}{77410}I got a hair sample,|a stool sample, piss.
{77412}{77461}I got fingernails.
{77506}{77539}He's laughing at us.
{77541}{77605}You got what you deserved.
{77669}{77730}He's alive! He's alive!
{77732}{77784}That cocksucker's alive!
{77786}{77891}Calm down! Emergency|on that ambulance!
{78238}{78277}He's playing games.
{78279}{78312}Ah, no shit.
{78352}{78428}We have to divorce|ourselves from emotion.
{78430}{78500}We have to remain|focused on the details.
{78502}{78541}I feed off my emotions.
{78543}{78574}Are you listening?
{78576}{78626}Yes, I can hear you.
{78628}{78660}Excuse me.
{78662}{78729}Closed crime scene.|Get the fuck out.
{78731}{78768}I got a right.
{78770}{78840}Get out of here, piece of shit!
{78842}{78877}Get out of here!
{78879}{78933}I got your picture, man.
{78935}{79011}Detective Mills.|M-i-l-l-s! Fuck off!
{79013}{79057}I'm surprised you can spell.
{79059}{79104}Fuck you!
{79106}{79179}How do they get here|so fucking quick?
{79181}{79268}They pay police for|the information and pay well.
{79270}{79317}Hey, man, I'm sorry.
{79319}{79359}I...
{79361}{79413}Well, he pissed me off.
{79415}{79512}It's impressive to see a man|feeding off his emotions.
{79688}{79736}A year of immobility|seems about right
{79738}{79803}judging by the deterioration|of the muscles in the spine.
{79805}{79874}Blood tests show many drugs|in his system,
{79876}{79908}even an antibiotic
{79910}{79966}which must have|been administered
{79968}{80013}to keep bedsores from infecting.
{80015}{80062}Has he tried to speak
{80064}{80110}or communicate in any way?
{80112}{80167}Even if his brain were not mush,
{80169}{80205}which it is,
{80207}{80287}he chewed off|his own tongue long ago.
{80289}{80349}Doctor.
{80351}{80398}Is there absolutely no chance
{80400}{80445}that he might survive?
{80447}{80502}Detective, he'd die|of shock right now
{80504}{80575}if you shined|a flashlight in his eyes.
{80577}{80646}He's experienced about|as much pain and suffering
{80648}{80719}as anyone I've encountered,|give or take,
{80721}{80805}and he still has hell|to look forward to.
{80807}{80840}Good night.
{80889}{80945}We bring you|the Charlie Parker Quintet,
{80947}{81008}featuring Charles Thompson on|piano, Herb Pomeroy's trumpet,
{81010}{81065}Jimmy Woode, bass,|Kenny Clarke, drums,
{81067}{81126}and the alto saxophone|of Charlie Parker.
{81128}{81164}Yeah.
{81166}{81198}Hello, William?
{81200}{81237}It's Tracy.
{81239}{81270}Tracy?
{81272}{81319}Is everything all right?
{81321}{81366}Yeah. Yes, everything's fine.
{81368}{81405}Where's David?
{81407}{81486}He's in the other room.|He's in the shower.
{81488}{81558}I'm sorry to call you like this.
{81560}{81596}Oh, it's all right.
{81598}{81670}What can I do for you, Tracy?
{81672}{81727}I, uh...
{81766}{81846}Um, I need someone to talk to.
{81848}{81917}Do you think you|could meet me...
{81919}{81981}somewhere maybe|tomorrow morning?
{81983}{82052}I don't understand.
{82054}{82110}I feel stupid calling,
{82112}{82162}but, uh...
{82164}{82247}you're the only person|that I know here.
{82249}{82296}There's no one else.
{82298}{82329}If you can,
{82331}{82392}just give me a call, OK?
{82394}{82449}I have to go now.
{82451}{82487}Good night.
{82489}{82543}Good night.
{82952}{83014}It can be a hard place.
{83016}{83049}I don't know
{83051}{83112}why I asked you to come.
{83114}{83182}Why don't you talk|to him about it?
{83184}{83231}Tell him how you feel.
{83233}{83312}I can't...you know,|I can't be a burden,
{83314}{83359}especially now.
{83410}{83456}I'll get used to things.
{83458}{83555}You know, I think|I just wanted to talk
{83557}{83632}to someone who's lived here|for a long time.
{83634}{83681}I mean upstate, you know,
{83683}{83775}it's a completely|different...environment.
{83844}{83918}Did David tell you|that I teach fifth grade?
{83920}{83957}Well, I did.
{83982}{84047}Uh, he mentioned it.
{84096}{84142}I'm going around,
{84144}{84214}you know, looking at schools,
{84216}{84279}but the conditions here...
{84281}{84325}are horrible.
{84369}{84416}What about primary schools?
{84469}{84505}I don't know.
{84507}{84559}Why don't you tell me
{84561}{84610}what's really|bothering you, Tracy?
{84666}{84748}David and I are|going to have a baby.
{84840}{84872}Oh, Tracy...
{84911}{84958}I don't think I'm...
{84960}{85029}I'm the one|to talk to about this.
{85031}{85064}I hate this city.
{85164}{85230}I had a relationship once.
{85232}{85302}It was very much|like a marriage.
{85353}{85395}We got pregnant.
{85425}{85489}This was a long time ago.
{85617}{85677}I remember getting up|one morning
{85679}{85735}and going to work,
{85737}{85797}just another day like any other
{85799}{85854}except it was the first day
{85856}{85927}after I knew|about...the pregnancy.
{85929}{85998}And I felt this fear
{86000}{86048}for the first time ever.
{86120}{86161}I remember thinking,
{86163}{86218}how can I bring a child
{86220}{86265}into a world like this
{86267}{86315}with all this around them?
{86487}{86561}I told her|I didn't want to have it...
{86593}{86674}And over the next few weeks,
{86676}{86737}I wore her down.
{86785}{86845}I want to have children.
{86929}{87014}I can tell you now...
{87016}{87061}I'm...l know...
{87063}{87118}I mean...
{87120}{87162}I'm positive
{87164}{87206}I made the right decision,
{87208}{87278}but there's not|a day that passes
{87280}{87312}that I don't wish
{87314}{87374}that I'd made|a different choice.
{87457}{87527}If you don't keep...
{87561}{87594}the baby -
{87596}{87670}I mean, if that's|your decision,
{87672}{87747}don't ever tell him|you were pregnant.
{87782}{87866}But if you choose|to have this baby,
{87868}{87939}you spoil that kid|every chance you get.
{88119}{88171}That's about all the advice
{88173}{88220}I can give you, Tracy.
{88394}{88425}I got to go.
{88450}{88487}William.
{88646}{88679}Thank you.
{89002}{89044}Victor's landlord said
{89046}{89111}there was cash in|the office mailbox
{89113}{89161}the first of every month.
{89270}{89325}" I never heard|a single complaint
{89327}{89397}"from the tenant|in apartment 306,
{89399}{89460}"and nobody ever|complained about him.
{89462}{89534}" He was the best tenant|I've ever had."
{89536}{89568}Yeah, a landlord's dream -
{89570}{89618}a paralyzed tenant|with no tongue.
{89620}{89688}Who pays the rent on time.
{89690}{89731}I'm sick of all this waiting.
{89733}{89781}This is the job.
{89783}{89829}Why aren't we out there?
{89831}{89892}Why do we sit here rotting,
{89894}{89963}waiting till|the lunatic does it again?
{89965}{89999}That's dismissive.
{90001}{90029}Don't make that mistake.
{90031}{90093}Come on. He's insane. Look.
{90095}{90156}Right now, he's probably|dancing around
{90158}{90196}in his grandma's panties,
{90198}{90252}yeah, rubbing himself|in peanut butter.
{90254}{90301}Ooh, how's that?
{90303}{90357}I don't think so.
{90359}{90428}Yeah, his luck will run out.
{90430}{90479}He's not depending on luck.
{90550}{90597}We walked into that apartment
{90599}{90635}exactly one year
{90637}{90692}after he tied Victor to the bed.
{90694}{90731}He wanted us to.
{90733}{90789}Don't know that for sure.
{90791}{90827}Oh, yes, we do.
{90829}{90860}This note he left,
{90862}{90928}his first words to us.
{90996}{91062}" ...leads up to light."
{91064}{91117}Fuck him. So what?
{91119}{91150}He's right so far.
{91152}{91199}Imagine the will it takes
{91201}{91285}to keep a man bound|for a full year,
{91287}{91381}to sever his hand and use it|to plant fingerprints,
{91383}{91443}to insert tubes|into his genitals.
{91445}{91481}This guy's methodical,
{91483}{91569}exacting, and worst|of all, patient.
{91571}{91607}He's a nut-bag.
{91609}{91674}Just because the fucker's|got a library card,
{91676}{91709}doesn't make him yoda.
{91805}{91850}How much money you got?
{91852}{91912}I got, like, 50. 50 bucks.
{91914}{91971}I propose a field trip.|Come on.
{92038}{92075}We'll make a list.
{92077}{92154}At the top we'll put|Purgatory, Canterbury Tales,
{92156}{92227}anything relating|to the seven deadly sins.
{92229}{92284}Ask yourself,|what would he study
{92286}{92346}to do the things he's done?
{92348}{92395}What are his interests now?
{92397}{92428}Jack the Ripper, for instance.
{92430}{92471}Where are we going?
{92473}{92495}The library.
{92833}{92851}Coupons! Coupons!
{92853}{92899}Free coupons. Discount...
{92901}{92942}Discount coupons!
{92944}{93013}They must have had|about 50 health violations
{93015}{93058}during their last inspection.
{93060}{93129}Could you at least|sit across from me?
{93131}{93202}I don't want people|thinking we're dating.
{93204}{93249}Give me your money.
{93251}{93297}I'm giving you this,
{93299}{93369}but I ought to know|what we're doing.
{93428}{93466}Fuck.
{93468}{93513}Hey, Somerset. How are you?
{93515}{93545}OK.
{93547}{93594}I didn't expect|a mnage trois.
{93596}{93654}It's not a problem. Sit down.
{93760}{93821}Only for you do I do this.
{93823}{93859}It's a big risk.
{93861}{93906}We're just fair and square.
{93908}{93939}It's a deal.
{93941}{93980}All right.
{94062}{94099}About an hour.
{94154}{94192}Yeah, help yourself.
{94245}{94321}Well, that was|money well spent.
{94323}{94360}Yeah.
{94546}{94578}All right.
{94580}{94617}By telling you this,
{94619}{94674}I'm trusting you|more than most people.
{94676}{94761}Good, because I'm|about ready to punch you.
{94763}{94794}It's probably nothing,
{94796}{94884}but it's no skin|off our teeth.
{94920}{94979}The guy in the pizza parlour
{94981}{95034}is a friend from the Bureau.
{95036}{95084}Who? Stinky man?
{95086}{95123}For years, the FBI
{95125}{95195}has been hooked into|the library system,
{95197}{95226}keeping records.
{95228}{95264}Mm-hmm. Assessing fines.
{95266}{95297}No, monitoring reading habits.
{95299}{95336}Look.
{95338}{95394}Certain books are flagged -
{95396}{95456}books on, say, nuclear weapons
{95458}{95490}or Mein Kampf.
{95492}{95562}Anyone who checks out|a flagged book
{95564}{95648}has his library records fed|into the FBl's computers.
{95650}{95696}Wait. How is this legal?
{95698}{95753}Legal, illegal -|these terms don't apply.
{95794}{95850}You can't use|the information directly.
{95852}{95897}It's just a useful guide.
{95899}{95936}It might sound silly,
{95938}{96008}but you can't get|a library card
{96010}{96080}without an l.D.|and a phone bill.
{96082}{96127}So they run a list.
{96129}{96155}Precisely.
{96157}{96224}If you want to know|who's reading
{96226}{96259}Purgatory and Paradise Lost
{96261}{96297}and Helter Skelter,
{96299}{96356}the FBl's computers|will tell us.
{96358}{96402}Could give us a name.
{96404}{96460}It could get a college kid
{96462}{96529}writing a term paper|on 20th-century crime.
{96531}{96601}At least you're|out of the office.
{96603}{96650}Get a haircut.
{96652}{96713}How do you know all this?
{96715}{96761}I don't. Neither do you.
{96763}{96794}Exactly.
{96981}{97024}The Divine Comedy,
{97026}{97073}History of Catholicism.
{97075}{97149}There's a book called|Murderers and Madmen.
{97151}{97182}Modern Homicide lnvestigation,
{97184}{97220}In Cold Blood,
{97222}{97265}Of Human Bondage.
{97267}{97289}Bondage?
{97291}{97336}Not what you're thinking.
{97338}{97375}The Marquis de Sharday.
{97377}{97423}It's the Marquis de Sade.
{97425}{97456}Whatever.
{97458}{97519}The writings of|Saint Thomas Aqua-something.
{97521}{97553}Saint Thomas Aquinas.
{97555}{97624}He wrote about|the seven deadly sins.
{97626}{97663}Is that it?
{97665}{97710}Yeah.
{97712}{97744}Let's try it.
{97746}{97783}Jonathan Doe?
{97785}{97819}Whatever.
{97821}{97866}We're sure about that name?
{97868}{97903}Yeah.
{97905}{97984}You saw the list. John Doe.
{97986}{98040}Let's take a look at him.
{98042}{98076}Talk to him.
{98078}{98110}This is crazy.
{98112}{98172}Ah, we'll just talk to him.
{98174}{98205}Excuse me, sir,
{98207}{98281}are you, by any chance,|a serial killer?
{98321}{98348}OK.
{98350}{98397}You do the talking.
{98399}{98459}Put that silver tongue to work.
{98461}{98532}Have you been talking|to my wife?
{98609}{98656}This is retarded.
{98658}{98707}Charlie's fucking Angels.
{98709}{98752}Name off a computer.
{98864}{98917}Mills.
{99138}{99174}You're hit.
{99176}{99209}No.
{99277}{99334}He's going down!|He's going down!
{99713}{99755}Fifth floor!
{99757}{99793}Mills.
{99833}{99879}Mommy!
{99881}{99931}Mommy!
{100241}{100294}Police. Is there a back exit?
{100296}{100332}Lock your door.
{100359}{100396}What's going on?
{100398}{100473}Get out of|the fucking hall, please.
{101074}{101102}Get down!
{101152}{101191}Get the fuck down!
{101993}{102030}Shit.
{103519}{103550}Goddamn it!
{103798}{103835}Fuck.
{104345}{104390}Taxi!
{105042}{105112}Get out of|the fucking way! Move!
{106559}{106586}Mills!
{106625}{106658}No!
{107150}{107187}Mills?
{107237}{107268}Mills.
{107270}{107307}Are you OK?
{107309}{107354}I'm all right.
{107356}{107404}I'm all right.
{107497}{107533}Where are you going?
{107535}{107566}I'm going in.
{107568}{107605}Wait, wait, wait.
{107607}{107628}Wait!
{107630}{107676}What are you talking about?
{107678}{107724}He fuckin' shot at us.
{107726}{107786}We can't go in.|We need a warrant.
{107788}{107820}We got probable cause.
{107822}{107883}Think. How did we get here?
{107885}{107916}I can't tell anyone.
{107918}{107978}I can't tell about the Bureau.
{107980}{108036}We have no reason to be here.
{108038}{108074}Listen to me.
{108076}{108122}Get the fuck off me!
{108124}{108180}I'm sorry,|but just pay attention.
{108182}{108251}If we leave a hole like this,
{108253}{108315}we can't prosecute.|The guy will walk.
{108317}{108362}Is that what you want?
{108364}{108410}By the time|we get the warrant...
{108412}{108444}Nah, fuck that! No!
{108446}{108530}We need a reason|to knock on this door!
{108532}{108564}Think about it!
{108614}{108651}OK.
{108700}{108731}OK.
{108733}{108769}OK, you're right.
{108771}{108804}I'm all fucked up.
{108806}{108843}You're right. You're right.
{109059}{109092}Well.
{109094}{109163}No point|in arguing any more...
{109165}{109218}unless you can fix that.
{109261}{109322}You stupid son of a...
{109515}{109575}How much money we got left?
{109577}{109647}So, yeah, like,|I noticed this guy
{109649}{109728}going out a lot|when the murders was happening,
{109730}{109766}and so l, um...
{109768}{109800}You called Detective Somerset,
{109802}{109834}right?
{109836}{109897}Right, so I called|the detective
{109899}{109935}because he looked creepy
{109937}{110002}and one of the murders|happened right over there.
{110004}{110042}OK, OK, OK...
{110044}{110089}I told you the rest.
{110091}{110142}You have to sign it.
{110144}{110191}OK.
{110193}{110225}All right.
{110227}{110263}You did good.
{110265}{110311}I did what you said.
{110313}{110363}Here. You get something to eat.
{110451}{110485}Everybody stay outside.
{111966}{112002}Victor.
{114706}{114743}Fuck.
{115185}{115259}Somerset!
{115284}{115327}Somerset!
{115329}{115367}Yeah.
{115440}{115471}What?
{115473}{115510}We had him.
{115512}{115557}What are you talking about?
{115559}{115606}It was the fucking photographer
{115608}{115640}on the fucking stairs.
{115749}{115806}We had him, and we let him go.
{115962}{116006}You're sure this is him?
{116008}{116046}Yeah. Good, good.
{116048}{116079}Uh, yeah. Good.
{116081}{116141}We've got nothing to go on.
{116143}{116199}No address books.|Just this receipt.
{116201}{116241}Then keep looking.
{116243}{116282}This was under the bed -
{116284}{116314}his only source of funds.
{116316}{116352}We got his money.
{116354}{116385}Fucking-A, good work.
{116387}{116449}One more thing|you won't believe.
{116451}{116505}We haven't found|a fingerprint, not one.
{116507}{116580}You're right. I don't|believe you. Keep looking.
{116673}{116723}We could use some more men.
{116725}{116785}I'm doing the best I can.
{116787}{116818}What's all this?
{116820}{116884}There are 2,000 notebooks|on these shelves.
{116886}{116932}Each contains about 250 pages.
{116934}{117002}Forget it. Anything|about the killings?
{117004}{117051}"What sick puppets we are.
{117053}{117113}"What a gross stage we dance on.
{117115}{117166}"What fun we have|dancing, fucking.
{117168}{117212}" Not a care in the world,
{117214}{117255}" not knowing|that we are nothing.
{117257}{117301}"We are not what was intended."
{117303}{117373}No, wait. There's a lot more.
{117375}{117407}"On the subway today,
{117409}{117481}"a man started|a conversation with me.
{117483}{117515}" He made small talk.
{117517}{117586}"A lonely man talking|about the weather.
{117588}{117619}" I tried to be pleasant,
{117621}{117701}" but my head began to hurt|from his banality,
{117703}{117768}" I almost didn't notice|it had happened,
{117770}{117839}" but I suddenly threw up|all over him.
{117841}{117885}" He was not pleased,
{117887}{117958}"and I couldn't stop laughing."
{117960}{117996}No dates.
{117998}{118102}Placed on the shelves|in no discernible order.
{118104}{118188}Just his mind|poured out on paper.
{118190}{118235}Looks like a life's work.
{118237}{118322}Even with 50 men,|it would take 2 months.
{118324}{118385}I know, I know, I know, I know.
{118449}{118493}Where's that phone?
{118574}{118644}Phone? Phone? Phone?
{118704}{118748}People, quiet!
{119111}{119147}Hello.
{119149}{119181}I admire you.
{119183}{119241}I don't know how you found me,
{119243}{119277}but imagine my surprise.
{119279}{119373}I respect you law enforcement|agents more every day.
{119375}{119439}Well, I appreciate|that...John.
{119441}{119473}I tell you...
{119475}{119532}No, you listen.|I'll be readjusting my schedule
{119534}{119589}in light|of today's little...setback.
{119591}{119661}I just had|to express my admiration.
{119663}{119733}I'm sorry I had|to hurt one of you,
{119735}{119805}but I didn't have|a choice, did l?
{119807}{119853}You will accept my apology?
{119855}{119924}I would say more,|but I'd ruin the surprise.
{120013}{120059}I'll be readjusting my schedule
{120061}{120107}in light|of today's little...setback.
{120109}{120142}Got it.
{120238}{120292}All right,|everybody back to work.
{120339}{120414}You were right. He's preaching.
{120416}{120524}Yeah. These murders|are his sermons to us.
{120526}{120562}Look, we know him,
{120564}{120612}we know him, we know him.
{120670}{120713}Who's the blonde?
{120817}{120860}Looks like a pro.
{120862}{120933}Maybe...she caught|John Doe's eye.
{121068}{121124}He collected it last night.
{121126}{121161}Last night?
{121163}{121200}This man?
{121202}{121271}Yeah. John Doe. He had a limp.
{121273}{121344}What was the job|you did for him?
{121346}{121411}I've got a picture.|One sweet piece.
{121413}{121446}I thought he was
{121448}{121491}one of them|performance artists,
{121493}{121542}the sort of guy
{121544}{121639}that pisses in a cap|onstage and then drinks it.
{121641}{121678}Performance art.
{121680}{121711}Yeah.
{121783}{121836}I think I undercharged him,|actually.
{121838}{121890}You made this for him?
{121892}{121963}I've made weirder shit|than that. So what?
{122071}{122119}They found the blonde.
{122190}{122226}The picture.
{122228}{122257}The picture!
{122290}{122334}Fucking pigs!
{122438}{122505}Get the fuck|out of the booth, pal!
{122507}{122587}I've been in this cage|the whole time, OK?
{122589}{122637}Come on. This way!
{122767}{122836}Can you do something|about this music?
{122838}{122922}We're working on it.|We're looking for the guy.
{123207}{123296}You from homicide?|You better see this.
{123298}{123346}Stay still, all right?
{123524}{123595}God, get this thing off of me!
{123597}{123647}Get him out of here now.
{123649}{123713}Get him out of here now!
{123715}{123795}Come on. I want|to hear it again.
{123797}{123836}Tell me again.
{123884}{123923}You heard nothing strange?
{123925}{123961}You saw nothing strange?
{123963}{123992}No.
{123994}{124050}No.
{124052}{124136}He asked if I was married.|He had a gun.
{124138}{124173}Where was the girl?
{124175}{124234}The what? What?
{124236}{124296}The girl. The prostitute.|Where was she?
{124298}{124341}Someone comes|to your establishment,
{124343}{124386}they want to go downstairs
{124388}{124455}to get a little|ooh-la-la, whatever,
{124457}{124531}they got to come to you, yeah?
{124533}{124555}Yeah.
{124557}{124626}You didn't see anyone|with a package,
{124628}{124689}a knapsack,|something under their arm?
{124691}{124745}Hey, everybody|that comes in there
{124747}{124821}has got a package|under their arms.
{124823}{124888}Some guys are carrying|suitcases full of stuff.
{124890}{124922}She was just...
{124924}{124999}She was just|sitting on the bed.
{125082}{125166}Who tied her down, you or him?
{125168}{125250}Do you like what|you do for a living?
{125252}{125315}No.
{125317}{125363}No, I don't.
{125394}{125466}But that's life, isn't it?
{125540}{125622}He...he... He had a gun,
{125624}{125702}and...and he made it happen.
{125737}{125797}He made me do it.
{125799}{125876}He...he put that thing on me.
{125878}{125940}Then he made me wear it.
{125942}{126022}Then he... he...told|me to fuck her.
{126072}{126128}And I did. I fucked her!
{126130}{126185}Oh, God. Oh, God.
{126187}{126257}He had a gun in my mouth.
{126259}{126327}The fucking gun|was in my throat!
{126329}{126375}Fuck!
{126424}{126462}Oh, God! God!
{126464}{126511}God, help me. Please.
{126513}{126550}Please help me!
{126552}{126590}Please help me!
{126978}{127043}This isn't going|to have a happy ending.
{127045}{127135}Hey, man. We catch him,|I'll be happy enough.
{127207}{127258}If we catch John Doe
{127260}{127339}and he turns out|to be Satan himself,
{127341}{127411}that might live up|to our expectations,
{127413}{127474}but he's not the devil.
{127476}{127523}He's just a man.
{127525}{127596}You know, you bitch|and you complain
{127598}{127655}and tell me these things and...
{127657}{127695}If you think
{127697}{127755}you're preparing me|for hard times,
{127757}{127789}thank you, but...
{127791}{127861}But you got to be a hero.
{127863}{127919}You want to be a champion.
{127921}{127966}People don't want a champion.
{127968}{128014}They want to eat cheeseburgers
{128016}{128051}and watch television.
{128053}{128129}How did you get like this?|I want to know.
{128131}{128167}Well...
{128205}{128288}It wasn't one thing,|I can tell you that.
{128318}{128355}Go on.
{128402}{128469}I just don't think|I can continue
{128471}{128539}to live in a place|that embraces apathy
{128541}{128600}as if it was a virtue.
{128602}{128650}You're no different, no better.
{128652}{128722}I didn't say I was. I'm not.
{128724}{128756}Hell, I sympathise.
{128758}{128794}I sympathise completely.
{128796}{128836}Apathy is a solution.
{128838}{128878}I mean, it's easier
{128880}{128925}to lose yourself in drugs
{128927}{128995}than it is to cope with life.
{128997}{129068}It's easier to steal|what you want.
{129070}{129151}It's easier to beat|a child than raise it.
{129153}{129204}Hell, love costs,|takes effort, work.
{129206}{129283}We are talking about people|who are mentally ill,
{129285}{129329}people who are fucking crazies.
{129331}{129359}No.
{129361}{129390}Yes.
{129392}{129448}We're talking about|everyday life here.
{129450}{129519}You can't afford|to be this nave.
{129521}{129566}Fuck off.
{129568}{129609}Gee.
{129611}{129662}You should listen to yourself.
{129664}{129779}You say, "The problem with|people is that they don't care,
{129781}{129848}so I don't care about people."
{129850}{129896}That makes no sense.
{129898}{129929}You care?
{129931}{129978}Damn right.
{129980}{130043}And you're going|to make a difference.
{130045}{130082}Whatever. The point is,
{130084}{130152}is that I don't|think you're quitting
{130154}{130195}because you believe|these things.
{130197}{130239}You want to believe them
{130241}{130287}because you're quitting.
{130289}{130359}You want me to agree with you
{130361}{130407}and say, " Yeah, you're right.
{130409}{130479}" It's all fucked up.|It's a fucking mess.
{130481}{130526}"We should all go live
{130528}{130575}" in a fucking log cabin."
{130577}{130623}But I won't.
{130625}{130667}I won't say that.
{130669}{130715}I don't agree with you.
{130717}{130758}I do not.
{130817}{130858}I can't.
{131098}{131151}I'm going to go home.
{131338}{131377}Thank you, though.
{132105}{132151}I love you, honey,
{132153}{132199}so much.
{132236}{132288}So much.
{132397}{132454}I know.
{133906}{134034}91 1 . What's your emergency?|Could you repeat that?
{134036}{134117}I've gone and done it again.
{134345}{134389}What have you got?
{134391}{134465}Sleeping pills...
{134467}{134504}Glued to one hand.
{134506}{134585}Telephone glued to the other.
{134587}{134620}You see what he did?
{134622}{134678}He sliced her up...
{134680}{134729}Then he bandaged her.
{134731}{134792}Call for help, and you'll live
{134794}{134831}but you'll be disfigured,
{134833}{134882}or you can put yourself
{134884}{134944}out of your own misery.
{134946}{134980}Come on.
{134982}{135034}Cut off her nose.
{135036}{135076}To spite her face.
{135078}{135153}He did it very recently.
{135295}{135362}Listen, I've decided to stay on
{135364}{135402}till this is done.
{135404}{135462}One of two things will happen.
{135464}{135542}Either we'll get John Doe,|or he'll finish his seven
{135544}{135604}and this case will|go on for years.
{135606}{135696}You don't have|to do me any favours.
{135698}{135765}Keep me as your partner|a few days.
{135767}{135822}You'll be doing me a favour.
{136060}{136139}You knew I'd say yes.|Hey, we're here.
{136141}{136254}Your wife called.|Get an answering machine.
{136256}{136318}Detective.
{136350}{136384}After this, I'm gone.
{136386}{136419}Detective.
{136421}{136450}No big surprise.
{136452}{136503}Detective!
{136534}{136584}You're looking for me.
{136649}{136709}Don't fucking move!|On the floor!
{136711}{136758}Keep away from him!
{136760}{136789}I know you.
{136791}{136830}Now! Get down!
{136832}{136876}Get down! On your stomach!
{136878}{136921}You piece of shit!
{136923}{136974}Now! All the way!
{136976}{137014}All the way, fucker!
{137016}{137044}Down! Faster! Faster!
{137046}{137095}Faster, fucker! Now!
{137097}{137149}Nose on the ground!
{137217}{137248}Jesus Christ.
{137250}{137296}What the fuck is this?
{137298}{137375}I'd like to speak|to my lawyer, please.
{137415}{137480}Goddamn it!
{137482}{137559}He cuts the skin|off his fingers.
{137561}{137647}That's why we couldn't find|one usable print.
{137649}{137716}He's been doing it|for quite some time.
{137718}{137797}What about the trace|on his bank accounts?
{137799}{137857}So far everything's a dead end.
{137859}{137904}No credit history,|no employment records.
{137906}{137983}His bank account's|only five years old.
{137985}{138030}It was started with cash.
{138032}{138082}The only thing we know
{138084}{138129}about that guy right now
{138131}{138192}is he's independently wealthy,|well-educated,
{138194}{138226}and totally insane.
{138228}{138274}He's John Doe by choice.
{138276}{138325}When do we question him?
{138327}{138397}You don't.|He's going to court now.
{138399}{138464}There's no way he would|turn himself in.
{138466}{138512}It doesn't make sense.
{138514}{138589}It's not supposed to make sense.
{138591}{138629}He's not finished.
{138631}{138698}No, he's just|pissing in our faces.
{138700}{138762}You know what I'm talking about.
{138764}{138815}For the first time ever,
{138817}{138894}you and I are|in total agreement.
{138896}{138940}So what the fuck, man?
{138942}{138987}He's two murders away
{138989}{139031}from completing his masterpiece.
{139033}{139114}We'll wait for his plea.
{139183}{139251}My client says there are|two more bodies. Hidden away.
{139253}{139359}He will take Detectives Mills|and Somerset to these bodies,
{139361}{139420}but only Detective|Mills and Somerset,
{139422}{139469}only at 6:00 today.
{139471}{139500}Why us?
{139502}{139556}He says he admires you.
{139558}{139630}It's part of the game.
{139632}{139690}My client claims that if|the detectives do not accept,
{139692}{139750}these bodies|will never be found.
{139752}{139822}Frankly, counsel,|I'm inclined to let them rot.
{139824}{139864}Hey, we've got him
{139866}{139911}downstairs,|locked up, done deal.
{139913}{139996}He's going to get free|room and board, cable TV.
{139998}{140069}Hell, my wife doesn't|even have cable.
{140071}{140104}Mills!
{140106}{140138}Hey, something stinks.
{140140}{140180}And this one here...
{140182}{140238}Yeah, you, in your $3,000 suit
{140240}{140309}and that smug smile,|dealing for that shit--
{140311}{140340}Mills!
{140342}{140389}I am required by law|to serve my clients.
{140391}{140428}Ah, Jesus Christ.
{140430}{140473}To serve their best interests.
{140475}{140530}We don't make deals here.
{140532}{140594}My client says if|you do not accept,
{140596}{140637}he will plead insanity.
{140639}{140735}Let him try it.|I'd like to see him try.
{140737}{140789}With the nature of these crimes,
{140791}{140871}I could get him off|with such a plea.
{140873}{140930}I'm not letting|this conviction slide.
{140932}{141002}He says that if you do accept,
{141004}{141057}he will sign a full confession,
{141059}{141100}plead guilty right now.
{141102}{141159}It's your case. Make a decision.
{141199}{141266}Full confession. I'm in.
{141268}{141336}It has to be the both of you.
{141338}{141404}If he were to claim insanity,
{141406}{141447}this conversation|is admissible -
{141449}{141510}the fact that he's|blackmailing us.
{141512}{141594}My client would remind you,|two more are dead.
{141596}{141664}The press would have a field day
{141666}{141746}if the police didn't seem|concerned about finding them.
{141748}{141800}If there are two more dead.
{141802}{141843}The lab report came.
{141845}{141908}They did a quickie|on Doe's clothing.
{141910}{141992}They found blood from Doe|slicing his fingers,
{141994}{142081}blood from the woman|whose face he cut off,
{142083}{142139}and blood from a third party,
{142141}{142178}as yet unidentified.
{142237}{142302}You'd be escorting|an unarmed man.
{142364}{142414}Let's finish it.
{142484}{142571}If John Doe's head opens|and a UFO flies out,
{142573}{142643}I want you to have expected it.
{142681}{142708}I will.
{142748}{142819}Hey, man, if I was|to accidentally
{142821}{142857}shave off a nipple,
{142859}{142931}would it be covered|by workman's comp?
{142996}{143032}I suppose so.
{143034}{143080}If you were man enough
{143082}{143128}to actually file a claim,
{143130}{143210}I'd buy you one|out of my own pocket.
{143212}{143255}I keep coming home late,
{143257}{143312}my wife's going|to think something's up.
{143521}{143581}You know...
{143583}{143617}Yeah.
{143760}{143795}What?
{145493}{145539}Let's go!
{146320}{146367}Spin it around!
{146369}{146400}There he is.
{146402}{146470}Late model|black sedan at 1 0:00.
{146686}{146724}Who are you, John?
{146726}{146773}Who are you really?
{146799}{146824}What do you mean?
{146826}{146873}At this stage,|what harm can it do
{146875}{146920}to tell us about yourself?
{146922}{146973}Who I am means|absolutely nothing.
{146975}{147058}You need to stay|on your left up here.
{147143}{147208}So where are we heading?
{147210}{147241}You'll see.
{147243}{147286}We're not just going to pick up
{147288}{147356}two more dead bodies,|are we, John?
{147358}{147399}That wouldn't be|shocking enough.
{147401}{147476}We've got newspapers|to think about, yeah?
{147478}{147540}Wanting people to listen,
{147542}{147646}you can't just tap them|on the shoulder any more.
{147648}{147711}You have to hit them|with a sledgehammer.
{147713}{147783}Then you'll notice you've got|their strict attention.
{147785}{147855}But the question is,|what makes you so special
{147857}{147899}that people should listen?
{147901}{147941}I'm not special.
{147943}{148029}I've never been|exceptional.
{148031}{148086}This is, though...|what I'm doing.
{148088}{148123}The work.
{148125}{148164}The work, John?
{148166}{148194}Yes.
{148196}{148279}See, I don't see anything|special about it, John.
{148281}{148340}That's not true.
{148342}{148409}It is true,|and the funny thing is,
{148411}{148479}all this work,|two months from now,
{148481}{148550}no one's going to give|a shit or remember.
{148552}{148643}You can't see|the whole complete act yet,
{148645}{148694}but when this is done,
{148696}{148758}when it's finished,
{148760}{148837}it's going to be...
{148900}{148971}People will barely|be able to comprehend,
{148973}{149042}but they won't be able|to deny.
{149044}{149116}Could the freak|be any more vague?
{149118}{149178}As far as master plans go.
{149180}{149295}I can't wait for you to see.|It's going to be something.
{149297}{149368}I'm going to be|right next to you,
{149370}{149441}so when this thing|happens, let me know.
{149443}{149501}I wouldn't want to miss it.
{149503}{149584}Oh, don't worry. You won't.
{149630}{149685}You won't miss a thing.
{149828}{149892}Going south.|Keep two miles separation.
{149894}{149928}Roger.
{150303}{150354}What's so exciting?
{150356}{150426}It's not too far now.
{150595}{150688}I've been trying to figure|something in my head.
{150690}{150753}Maybe you can help me out.
{150755}{150836}When a person is insane,|as you clearly are,
{150838}{150897}do you know that you're insane?
{150899}{150957}Maybe you're reading|Guns & Ammo,
{150959}{151009}masturbating in your own faeces,
{151011}{151061}do you stop and go,
{151063}{151149}"Wow, it is amazing|how fucking crazy I really am" ?
{151151}{151214}Do you guys do that?
{151216}{151248}It's more comfortable for you
{151250}{151297}to label me insane.
{151299}{151332}It's very comfortable.
{151334}{151365}It's not something
{151367}{151424}I would expect you to accept,
{151426}{151470}but I did not choose.
{151472}{151504}I was chosen.
{151506}{151537}Whatever.
{151539}{151609}I don't doubt that|you believe that, John,
{151611}{151658}but seems to me
{151660}{151708}you're overlooking|a glaring contradiction.
{151710}{151748}Meaning what?
{151750}{151818}Glad you asked.
{151851}{151910}If you were chosen--
{151912}{151987}that is, by a higher power--
{151989}{152053}and if your hand was forced,
{152055}{152093}seems strange to me
{152095}{152166}you would get such|enjoyment out of it.
{152168}{152213}You enjoyed torturing|those people.
{152215}{152260}Just doesn't seem
{152262}{152330}in keeping with|martyrdom, does it?
{152332}{152380}John?
{152464}{152524}I doubt I enjoyed it any more
{152526}{152608}than Detective Mills|would enjoy time alone with me
{152610}{152671}in a room without windows.
{152673}{152788}How happy would it make you|to hurt me with impunity?
{152790}{152823}That hurts my feelings.
{152825}{152872}I would never...
{152874}{152942}You wouldn't only because|there's consequences.
{152944}{153039}It's in those eyes|of yours, though.
{153041}{153107}Nothing wrong with a man|taking pleasure in his work.
{153109}{153187}I won't deny|my own personal desire
{153189}{153271}to turn each sin|against the sinner.
{153273}{153346}Wait a minute.|I thought all you did
{153348}{153387}was kill innocent people.
{153389}{153455}Innocent? ls that|supposed to be funny?
{153457}{153513}An obese man, a disgusting man
{153515}{153560}who could barely stand up,
{153562}{153615}who you'd point out to friends
{153617}{153675}so they could join you|in mocking him?
{153677}{153735}If you saw him|while you were eating,
{153737}{153804}you wouldn't be able|to finish your meal.
{153806}{153859}After him, I picked the lawyer,
{153861}{153946}and you both must have|secretly been thanking me.
{153948}{154075}This man dedicated his life|to making money by lying
{154077}{154167}to keeping murderers|and rapists on the streets!
{154169}{154206}Murderers.
{154208}{154229}Murderers, John, like yourself.
{154231}{154277}A woman so ugly inside
{154279}{154324}that she couldn't bear living
{154326}{154397}if she couldn't be beautiful|on the outside.
{154399}{154430}A drug dealer -
{154432}{154479}a drug-dealing pederast,|actually.
{154481}{154566}And let's not forget|the disease-spreading whore.
{154621}{154676}Only in a world this shitty
{154678}{154770}could you even try to say|these were innocent people
{154772}{154831}and keep a straight face.
{154833}{154897}But that's the point.
{154899}{154983}We see a deadly sin|on every street corner,
{154985}{155021}in every home,
{155023}{155068}and we tolerate it.
{155070}{155126}We tolerate it|because it's common,
{155128}{155173}it's...it's trivial.
{155175}{155252}We tolerate it|morning, noon, and night.
{155333}{155385}Well, not any more.
{155428}{155499}I'm setting the example,
{155501}{155604}and what I've done|is going to be puzzled over
{155606}{155652}and studied
{155654}{155730}and followed
{155732}{155779}forever.
{155781}{155827}Yeah.
{155829}{155886}Delusions of grandeur.
{155931}{155981}You should be thanking me.
{155983}{156023}Why is that, John?
{156025}{156131}Because you're going to be|remembered after this.
{156133}{156197}The only reason|that I'm here right now
{156199}{156253}is that I wanted to be.
{156255}{156315}No. We would have|got you eventually.
{156317}{156393}Oh, really?|So, what were you doing?
{156395}{156456}Biding your time,|toying with me?
{156458}{156515}Allowing five|innocent people to die
{156517}{156600}until you felt like|springing your trap?
{156602}{156650}What was|the indisputable evidence
{156652}{156723}you were going to use on me
{156725}{156813}before I walked up to you|and put my hands in the air?
{156815}{156849}John, calm down.
{156851}{156893}I seem to remember us
{156895}{156932}knocking on your door.
{156934}{156979}Oh, that's right.
{156981}{157065}And I seem to remember|breaking your face.
{157164}{157234}You're only alive|because I didn't kill you.
{157236}{157276}OK. Sit back.
{157278}{157319}I spared you.
{157321}{157387}Remember that every time|you look in the mirror
{157389}{157441}for the rest of your life,
{157443}{157561}or for the rest of what life|I've allowed you to have.
{157563}{157610}Sit back, you fucking freak!
{157612}{157651}Shut your fucking mouth!
{157653}{157689}You're no messiah.
{157691}{157749}You're a movie of the week.
{157751}{157795}You're a fucking t-shirt,
{157797}{157844}at best.
{158148}{158198}Don't ask me|to pity those people.
{158200}{158242}I don't mourn them any more
{158244}{158317}than the thousands that died|at Sodom and Gomorrah.
{158319}{158386}Is that to say|what you were doing
{158388}{158433}was God's good work?
{158502}{158588}The Lord works|in mysterious ways.
{158615}{158686}Do you see|those high-tension towers?
{158688}{158719}That's where we're headed.
{158721}{158767}I see where|he's talking about.
{158769}{158807}Follow the access road.
{158942}{159016}Your signal's breaking up.
{159018}{159065}Un-fucking-avoidable, sir.
{159067}{159117}We're in powerline city.
{159119}{159198}There sure as shit|is no ambush out here.
{159200}{159266}Can't land anywhere|near those wires.
{159268}{159352}They're coming up behind us|in about two minutes.
{159354}{159393}Go up, way up.
{159395}{159487}30 seconds, back east.|On my mark. 30 seconds.
{160947}{160995}I'm getting him out.
{161105}{161151}We've got you in sight.
{161153}{161200}Get out...
{161202}{161258}Slowly.
{161260}{161310}Stop.
{161312}{161357}Stay.
{161414}{161444}What do you got?
{161446}{161524}Dead dog.
{161552}{161592}I didn't do that.
{161680}{161734}We're holding on stand-by. Copy.
{161736}{161785}What time is it?
{161787}{161826}Why?
{161828}{161867}I'd like to know.
{161936}{161973}7:01 .
{162031}{162080}It's close.
{162082}{162132}Well, let's go take a look.
{162202}{162247}It's this way.
{162309}{162362}Bird Two, close your distance.
{162364}{162444}They're moving|away from the car.
{162515}{162561}We got them, we got them.
{162563}{162595}Closing in.
{162597}{162647}Negative, negative.
{163265}{163310}Mills.
{163405}{163495}Down. Down, down.
{163497}{163545}Watch him.
{163547}{163610}There he goes.
{163612}{163674}It's good we have|time to talk.
{163811}{163892}Stay on the guy in red!
{164130}{164173}There's a van|coming down the road
{164175}{164219}from the north.
{164432}{164478}Be ready for anything now.
{164480}{164540}Wait for my signal. Wait for me.
{164668}{164717}Get out of the van!
{164748}{164777}Out!
{164779}{164828}Jesus Christ, man.|Don't shoot me!
{164830}{164870}Step away!
{164872}{164929}Turn around.|Put your hands on your head!
{164931}{164973}What the hell is going on?
{164975}{165024}What are you doing here?
{165026}{165082}I'm just delivering|a package, man.
{165084}{165153}I got this package|for this guy David,
{165155}{165203}Detective David Mills.
{165347}{165379}Get it...
{165381}{165429}Slowly.
{165431}{165489}He's opening|the back of the van.
{165491}{165543}We've got him in sight.
{165683}{165733}This guy paid me 500 bucks
{165735}{165772}to bring it out here, man.
{165774}{165829}He said he wanted it here|at exactly 7:00.
{165831}{165855}Put it down.
{165885}{165929}We got a box.
{165931}{165968}We got a box!
{165970}{166033}Call the bomb squad.|We got a box.
{166035}{166074}Face the van.
{166076}{166128}Hands up.
{166295}{166326}Turn around.
{166365}{166394}OK. Go.
{166396}{166468}Off you go. Go!
{166470}{166538}I'm sending the driver|round on foot.
{166603}{166661}He's headed north|along the road.
{166663}{166703}Have him picked up.
{166905}{166962}I don't know. I don't know.
{167107}{167158}I'm going to open it.
{167160}{167210}When I said I admired you,
{167212}{167257}I meant what I said.
{167682}{167728}There's blood.
{167730}{167824}You've made quite a life|for yourself, Detective.
{167826}{167876}Shut the fuck up,|you piece of shit.
{168525}{168571}California, stay away from here.
{168573}{168640}Stay away from here.|Don't come in here.
{168642}{168695}Whatever you hear, stay away.
{168697}{168758}John Doe has the upper hand.
{168760}{168798}Mills!
{168800}{168836}Here he comes.
{168838}{168885}Throw your gun down!
{168887}{168941}I wish I could have|lived like you did.
{168943}{168972}What the fuck you talking about?
{168974}{169050}Do you hear me, Detective?
{169052}{169118}I'm trying to tell you|how much I admire you
{169120}{169156}and your pretty wife.
{169158}{169204}What?
{169206}{169237}Tracy.
{169239}{169276}What'd you fuckin' say?
{169278}{169357}It's disturbing how easily|a member of the press
{169359}{169437}can purchase information|from the men in your precinct.
{169439}{169484}What the fuck?
{169486}{169539}Throw your gun down!
{169541}{169592}I visited your home this morning
{169594}{169636}after you'd left.
{169638}{169714}I tried to play husband.
{169716}{169809}I tried to taste|the life of a simple man.
{169811}{169843}Throw it away!
{169845}{169899}It didn't work out...
{169901}{169988}So I took a souvenir -
{170024}{170075}her pretty head.
{170077}{170114}Mills!
{170186}{170227}What's he talking about?
{170229}{170251}Give me your gun.
{170253}{170283}What's going on there ?
{170285}{170332}Put the gun...put the gun down.
{170334}{170369}What was in the box?
{170371}{170415}Because I envy|your normal life.
{170417}{170444}Put the gun down.
{170446}{170490}It seems that envy is my sin.
{170492}{170538}What's in the box?
{170540}{170579}What's in the fucking box?
{170581}{170622}I just told you.
{170624}{170651}You lie!
{170653}{170704}You're a fucking liar!
{170706}{170738}That's what he wants.
{170740}{170786}He wants you to shoot him.
{170788}{170849}No! No!
{170851}{170917}You tell me that it's not true.
{170919}{170967}Become vengeance, David.
{170969}{171005}She's all right.
{171007}{171061}Become...wrath.
{171063}{171095}Tell me!
{171097}{171146}If you murder a suspect,|David...
{171148}{171186}No!
{171188}{171238}No!
{171240}{171289}She begged for her life,|Detective.
{171291}{171346}She begged for her life
{171348}{171380}and for her baby's life.
{171382}{171408}Shut up!
{171828}{171872}He didn't know.
{172193}{172245}Give me the gun, David.
{172370}{172412}David...
{172414}{172478}If you kill him...
{172480}{172557}he will win.
{172644}{172680}Oh, God!
{172682}{172728}Oh, God!
{173106}{173148}Oh, fuck. He shot him!
{173673}{173721}Set it down somewhere.
{173770}{173816}Come on. Set us down.
{173879}{173912}Holy Christ,
{173914}{173959}somebody call somebody.
{173961}{174022}Call somebody.
{174355}{174440}Well, we'll take care of him.
{174638}{174693}Whatever he needs.
{174695}{174755}Where are you going to be?
{174819}{174852}Around.
{174959}{174995}I'll be around.
{175087}{175149}Ernest Hemingway once wrote,
{175151}{175206}"The world is a fine place
{175208}{175278}"and worth fighting for."
{175280}{175344}I agree with the second part.
