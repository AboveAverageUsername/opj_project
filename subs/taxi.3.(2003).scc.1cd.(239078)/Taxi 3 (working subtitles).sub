{5111}{5138}Are you free?
{5139}{5220}Mylord's offer is tempting,|alas, my heart is taken...

{7098}{7158}Mylord is lucky, the streets of|Marseille are empty in winter...
{7159}{7200}it's more practical for sightseeing!
{7201}{7232}Yeah, lucky me...

{8336}{8375}Who else 'd you think?|The Air Force?
{8376}{8465}Looks like he's in good shape!|The cops won't catch him anytime soon!
{8466}{8565}I wouldn't be so sure...|Apparently, the cops have a new weapon!
{8566}{8640}A new weapon? What kind of weapon?
{8641}{8685}A secret one.
{8686}{8750}"State Police"

{9628}{9695}l was worried there,|l thought they were asleep!
{9696}{9724}But that's a cop car!
{9725}{9763}Oh no, just some old pals...
{9764}{9815}They're very playful, you know!
{9835}{9866}Bertrand, get his number|as soon as we're close enough!

{10304}{10342}Ok, game's over.|Hang on!
{10507}{10534}Hey, why are you stopping?
{10535}{10580}Are you kidding?|I'm pedal to the metal!
{10630}{10650}Is that nitro?
{10651}{10706}Oh no, a friend of mine has a bar...
{10710}{10750}it's made with Pastis.
{10758}{10824}If you want, I can give you the address...
{10825}{10857}You're very kind!

{11300}{11334}Yeah, it's a good machine...
{11336}{11440}it's fast in the curves...|but kinda slow in a straight line!
{11475}{11505}Mamma mia!
{11643}{11668}Where do I drop you off?
{11669}{11710}Here!|Right here.

{15983}{16015}What's wrong?
{16032}{16135}Nothing. l had a nightmare.|Go back to sleep, darling.
{16734}{16763}What the hell are you doing?
{16764}{16825}Nothing! It's only been 8 months|that I can't sleep!
{16841}{16868}Because of that gang?
{16874}{16982}They've been bugging us for 8 months.|8 months! I can't get them off my mind!
{16983}{17078}I noticed that! I've been trying|to tell you something for 8 months!
{17079}{17149}I know, I know...  We just can't|get them, no matter how we try!
{17150}{17184}Did you hear what I said?
{17185}{17200}Of course!
{17201}{17254}And I'm glad you mention it,|because 37 hold ups in 8 months...
{17255}{17295}all dressed up as Santa Claus,|can you imagine that?
{17297}{17348}And you don't believe in|Santa anymore, right?
{17349}{17394}I do! I mean, no,|it's not the problem...
{17395}{17461}Now winter's here and I worry about the|Christmas present they may be preparing!
{17462}{17522}Speaking of which, I already know|what I'm getting you for Christmas...
{17558}{17665}Thanks Petra but you can't help me.|I must catch that gang by Christmas!
{17669}{17742}And me Émilien, l need to talk|to you BEFORE Christmas!
{17755}{17790}Ok, that's a deal.
{17821}{17845}What are you doing?
{17854}{17882}l'm going to the office.
{17891}{17921}But it's 3 AM!
{17923}{18088}What? Oh yeah... That's ok.|l'll avoid rush hour traffic.
{18089}{18124}There won't be any traffic for sure!
{18125}{18145}Good!
{18266}{18300}See you in the office?
{19381}{19425}Hello, I'd like to|make an appointment!
{19441}{19486}Oh - Lily, honey!|You up already!
{19487}{19551}Yes! I'm awake at 4 AM,|because my man is fixing his car!
{19552}{19611}But it ain't broken!|lt's winter time.
{19616}{19695}l am just making some modifications|to make it more stable in the cold...
{19719}{19795}Listen, could you also install a heater|in my bed when you got time?
{19797}{19875}It would make me a bit more stable|too, since I'm ALONE in a cold bed!
{19876}{19940}Except that it's not just in|winter time but all year round!
{19941}{19965}Don't say that, Lily...
{19966}{20070}Don't touch me! It'll take me forever|to remove the stains with a scrungie!
{20078}{20115}Uh... what's a scrungie?
{20116}{20235}A scrungie is used to clean out jugs,|pans and stupid pots - like me!
{20236}{20283}Don't say that! Let me wash my hands,|I'll be with you in a minute.
{20284}{20350}Oh no no no dear sir,|that's not how it works!
{20353}{20445}You wash your hands, then wait an hour|for that "white spirit" stench to vanish
{20446}{20500}and by then, usually|it's time to go to work!
{20526}{20564}Gee you're really up and running today!
{20565}{20636}Look, I woke up two hours ago,|watched you in your sleep for 30 min,
{20637}{20700}and since I couldn't sleep,|I decided to do something useful
{20701}{20745}instead of just watching TV!
{20752}{20795}Daniel! We don't HAVE a TV!
{20825}{20865}Never mind, it's the|principle that counts!
{20866}{20905}There's no TV, no stereo
{20906}{20985}no curtains, no couch, not a single|vase to put some flowers in...
{20993}{21035}assuming you'd ever offer me flowers...
{21038}{21130}But we DO have a fridge. It's filled|with motor oil, but we have a fridge!
{21142}{21154}Lily...
{21155}{21200}We also have a shower|that smells of gas...
{21201}{21250}a washer, specially designed|to wash car covers...
{21251}{21315}a wardrobe, in which|my dresses must fight
{21316}{21361}for room with host of tires...|- Lily!
{21363}{21522}And finally, a glorious symbol of our|luxurious life, we also own... a garage!
{21523}{21564}Hey what's wrong with you?|You're getting your period?
{21565}{21610}No I'm not, that's the whole point!
{21625}{21677}l just can't live anymore in a garage!
{21678}{21720}l am a women.|Do you remember what that is?
{21723}{21780}A woman is not just a smile|and a peachy soft skin.
{21790}{21912}A women moves, thinks, evolves, and|sometimes would like some comfort!
{21976}{22041}Oh dear... all this just because|I like to tinker with my car!
{22042}{22072}That's women for you...!
{22211}{22264}What's all that fuss about,|white spirit smells good!
{22465}{22495}Lily, what are you doing?
{22529}{22562}I'm going back to live with my parents.
{22564}{22605}What, you're trading a garage|for an army barracks?
{22606}{22680}Barracks with curtains, a small|garden and flowers on the table!
{22681}{22728}Lily, this is ridiculous.|You can't leave me like that!
{22729}{22772}You thought it was funny to|live in here with me!
{22773}{22845}Yes, but it's not  funny anymore and|I've been trying to tell you for months!
{22846}{22900}First of all you don't live with ME,|you live with your CAR!
{22901}{22935}This garage is too small|for both of us!
{22965}{23007}It's your car or me. Good bye!
{24161}{24238}Hi there, girls!|Getting the puppies some fresh air?
{24279}{24361}Hey, take it easy!|What's a little joke between friends...
{24399}{24442}Well then... Merry Christmas!
{24617}{24666}But...? What are you doing...?
{24711}{24756}Did you sleep in here?
{24758}{24795}No, l was just dozing for five minutes...
{24819}{24912}Must've been 5 long minutes then,|the folder is stamped on your face!
{24929}{24970}See, it's the same with trees...
{24971}{25020}You know, tree stumps?|One circle equals one year?
{25021}{25100}Well see, I can tell you've|been sleeping for...
{25148}{25172}...20 years.
{25281}{25335}Oh, forget it.|Just forget what I said, ok?
{25351}{25406}Apparently nobody likes jokes|anymore around here...
{25410}{25465}To think that I signed up because|I thought we'd have some fun...
{25466}{25515}Stop it or I'm gonna split|your side... with an axe!
{25518}{25590}Hey guys! I just got some fresh|weed here, want some?
{25605}{25699}Oh, no, no...|NO! No no no...!
{25700}{25745}Don't be stupid guys, it's high quality!|Straight from Jamaica!
{25746}{25888}Gosh really, from Jamaic...?|... no! Who'd you think we are?
{25892}{25950}OK then - your loss.|Bye!
{25955}{25967}Bye...
{25985}{26000}Tell me...
{26008}{26045}Hey!|What about some coke?
{26075}{26090}Rashid...!
{26092}{26125}Well then, good day to you...
{26162}{26200}What's that supposed to mean?
{26238}{26280}And what are all these posters on the wall?
{26282}{26309}Uh... Bob Marley?
{26311}{26352}Damnit, this is a police|station, not a squat!
{26353}{26440}Are you aware that we've been trying|to catch a gang for the past 8 months?
{26460}{26480}The Santa Claus gang?
{26481}{26512}Yes, the Santa Claus gang!
{26525}{26575}Glad you remembered|the name, at least!
{26600}{26665}37 robberies in 8 months,|and no clue, nothing!
{26687}{26740}I've searched everywhere...|and nothing, nothing at all.
{26776}{26838}I feel useless.|A loser.
{26921}{27025}How about if I... if I ask|Rashid for a little, uh, tonic?
{27026}{27055}No.
{27062}{27102}I'm just trying to help here...
{27152}{27210}How about a little breakfast then?
{27255}{27310}Just to get some energy back?
{27362}{27395}OK, let's go have breakfast.
{27802}{27868}Guess you were a little hungry, eh?
{27869}{27927}I haven't eaten for days, out of|worrying over this case!
{27940}{27967}l have these terrible nightmares.
{27968}{28025}I'm strapped to a chair and a dozen|Santas dance around me...
{28026}{28050}It's horrible!
{28051}{28102}Stop it. Stop it, it's horrible!
{28115}{28145}Your shoe's untied.
{28169}{28264}Plus it'll be Christmas soon,|they'll be able to hide much better!
{28265}{28322}That's right! It was easier in July!
{28323}{28368}Yeah but we didn't catch 'em then...
{28369}{28425}And now Christmas is coming,|and I know they're up to something.
{28426}{28470}Something big, to finish|the year with a bang.
{28475}{28600}There's one thing that's puzzling me:|why do they dress up as Santa Claus?
{28602}{28643}Nobody would suspect a Santa!|Look over there...
{28681}{28770}Santa is nice, he gives presents,|looks dorky in his big red outfit...
{28816}{28842}It's usually too big...
{28948}{28978}Or too small...
{29069}{29105}It's a perfect disguise...
{29142}{29180}to hide...
{29238}{29263}a gun!
{29592}{29665}I can see that you are interested|in our new food processor
{29667}{29705}it can chop, slice and grind!
{29720}{29755}Do you have kids?
{30160}{30225}You there, freeze!|Police!
{30342}{30392}Don't move!|You are under arrest!
{30448}{30473}What happened?
{30474}{30545}I got one, Alain!|It took me 8 months, but I got one!
{30553}{30625}But how did you know he was a fake,|I mean, a member of the gang?
{30626}{30685}Have you ever seen a Santa|carry a peacemaker?
{30686}{30722}A gun! How'd you know?
{30723}{30757}This dork dropped it!
{30758}{30780}What a dork!
{30783}{30812}Yep, dorky for sure.
{30813}{30826}You're a dork!
{30831}{30874}The inspector's gonna like this!|Let's go!
{30880}{30984}Hello boss! Look what I got here!|Shit, where is he when you need him?
{30985}{31040}You, put your ass down|there and don't move, ok?
{31086}{31168}Well, until the Chief gets here,|let's just pretend I'm the Chief, ok?
{31189}{31223}I think that desk fits me, what d'you think?
{31237}{31263}Hey, you're sure about this?
{31264}{31313}Bof, he's gone anyway...|And after this catch,
{31314}{31365}I'm sure we won't remain simple|inspectors much longer, trust me!
{31370}{31454}Ok Santa, in the meantime you're gonna|tell us how you got a cop's gun...
{31455}{31485}Who did you steal it from?
{31535}{31580}Alain, I think that Santa|is looking for an address...
{31610}{31635}The Marseille region?
{31800}{31879}Whenever you forget something,|my colleague will use the directory.
{31880}{31898}You got that?
{31899}{31973}Now about this gun... you know,|there is a registration number here...
{31974}{32017}All we have to do is|search the database,
{32018}{32055}and in a few seconds we'll know
{32056}{32106}which idiot got his weapon mugged!
{32193}{32260}What a dork!|He stole Gibert's gun!
{32308}{32360}- lmpossible!|- l swear. Take a look!
{32368}{32422}Did you know that you stole this|from our favorite commissioner?
{32438}{32490}Can you explain how|you pulled that off?
{32510}{32528}Alain...
{32533}{32600}Maybe it would be easier|if we removed the sticky tape...?
{32630}{32670}You're right.|That might help.
{32810}{32834}Émilien?
{32877}{32925}Co... commissioner!
{32985}{33015}I'm needed out there...
{33087}{33136}But why are you dressed up|like that, Commissioner?
{33137}{33233}l am doing my job, Émilien. I tried|to infiltrate the Santa Claus gang...
{33234}{33290}but you had to screw up|everything, as usual!
{33305}{33352}I'm... I'm sorry, Chief, but...!
{33368}{33420}Why didn't you inform us,|we would all have joined you!
{33421}{33470}It's not an invasion,|It's an infiltration...
{33471}{33520}Precise, meticulous|and SOLITARY!
{33522}{33602}But don't worry Émilien, I'll get|a tailored costume for you.
{33603}{33685}It includes a cap and a whistle,|so you can infiltrate every crossroad!
{33711}{33760}And now would you please|unfasten me, so I can kill you?
{33761}{33789}Of course, Chief.
{33792}{33854}Shit...|Alain took the key with him!
{33855}{33901}Hurry up Émilien,|I'm losing patience!
{33902}{33925}5 minutes, Chief.
{34144}{34180}Are you Commissioner Gibert?
{34210}{34239}No, not yet...
{34240}{34355}I mean, I'm not commissioner yet and|I'm not called Gibert... unfortunately.
{34359}{34420}I mean, I sure wouldn't want|to be called Gibert, but...
{34421}{34442}The key, Émilien...!
{34445}{34468}Right away, Chief!
{34671}{34715}Are you commissioner Gibert?
{34761}{34839}Yes I am... wha wha...|wow... what can I help you?

{36741}{36837}We are trying to catch a gang, whose|members disguise as Santa Claus.
{36838}{36929}So we have to merge with their universe|in order to penetrate them better...
{36932}{36962}And the handcuffs?
{36965}{37005}I have no idea, they're not mine!
{37030}{37068}So, any further questions?

{37929}{37960}So of course, l thought|he was from the gang!
{37961}{38025}You don't need to see a Santa|or a gun to think about it!
{38026}{38055}You're ALWAYS thinking|about that gang!
{38056}{38150}Yes, but this time there were both:|a Santa AND a gun, so I arrested him.
{38152}{38190}You disarmed him by yourself?
{38199}{38225}Well... yes?
{38226}{38265}Guess he wasn't|from the gang, then.
{38275}{38350}Unfortunately not...|lt was Gibert, dressed up as Santa.
{38371}{38412}Sure, just laugh at me.
{38413}{38509}It's the worst day of my life, and you|are laughing instead of cheering me up!
{38510}{38540}You'd like me to cheer you up?
{38541}{38632}Why, yes... you could say something nice,|some tender, loving words...
{38635}{38727}for example, tell me some good news.|Just for ONCE today, some GOOD news!
{38728}{38790}Émilien! l am pregnant.
{38805}{38821}No!
{38822}{38880}Yes!|How's that for good news?
{38882}{38955}Well yes, of course....|But how long have you been...?
{38956}{38990}For 8 months, Émilien!
{39002}{39045}- No!|- Yes!
{39060}{39112}Oh... but how did it happen?
{39113}{39170}I met the Holy Ghost,|8 months ago...
{39171}{39278}8 months? It can't be! I was there,|I would have seen, your belly...
{39282}{39315}And your breasts...
{39342}{39420}Aah... so that's why they became so...!
{39462}{39515}And you... you're gonna keep it?
{39516}{39568}It's a bit too late|to ask that question!
{39570}{39614}Well yes, but...|why didn't you tell me?
{39615}{39674}I've been trying to|tell you for 8 months!
{39675}{39760}I've placed cauliflowers in every room!|There... and there!
{39777}{39845}Oh... yeah, l was wondering|about all those veggies!
{39846}{39945}And I hung up at least 20 echographies.|They are everywhere!
{40243}{40265}ls it my baby?
{40266}{40295}Well for now it's mine.
{40296}{40352}lf you want a share of it,|you'll better wake up!
{40412}{40439}ls the baby normal?
{40440}{40512}Good question, when you|know the  father...
{40513}{40570}but yes, amazingly,|everything is normal!
{40573}{40658}But then... if you're pregnant|and everything is normal...
{40659}{40764}and you want to keep the baby...|That means I will be a daddy?
{40765}{40894}Yes! What a display of brainpower!|You should consider joining the police.
{40895}{40927}l am going to be a daddy?
{40930}{41020}Yes. And this child will need|a super-daddy.
{41056}{41152}Count on me Petra,|Count on me...!
{41174}{41199}Lily!
{41464}{41504}What a fool you are.
{41511}{41602}What good is your big car now, if you|can't put the woman you love in it?
{41725}{41750}Rapid test?
{41774}{41816}Rapid test for what?
{41873}{41931}Two bars...|What does that mean, two bars?
{42149}{42164}Hello!
{42168}{42175}Hello!
{42180}{42220}Do you have the box|that comes with this?
{42232}{42257}Let me see...
{42301}{42382}"Clearblue rapid test".|Hey, isn't that a pregnancy test?
{42385}{42437}Yes exactly, that's what|I'm anxious to find out!
{42438}{42530}Aaah, I see... Let me fetch them,|they're right next to the condoms...
{42941}{42975}Guess what, I'm out of them!
{42976}{43069}They're in high demand these days.|Women love to make those presents...
{43070}{43112}... a cute little baby for Christmas!
{43113}{43165}See, I want to find out if|this is my Christmas present!
{43182}{43264}Aaah, I see... Just a minute,|let me ask my daughter.
{43266}{43290}Angel!
{43295}{43389}She's studying pharmacy,|she knows all that stuff by heart.
{43390}{43425}You'll see, it's really impressive!
{43428}{43460}Angel, what's that?
{43505}{43568}l am so sorry daddy!|I swear I tried to be careful!
{43577}{43630}But I drank a little too much|and ran out of protections...
{43645}{43719}But honey! There are condoms here,|I told you to just help yourself!
{43720}{43755}Yes, but we don't|have his size!
{43771}{43785}Who did that to you?
{43789}{43810}I have no idea!
{43811}{43855}What do you mean, "no idea"!|Doesn't that guy have a name?
{43857}{43930}l told you, l was drunk!|I can't remember all their names!
{43946}{43977}Oh my God...!
{43988}{44040}Oh come on... merry Christmas!
{44065}{44088}"Where is the police?"
{44090}{44125}Gentlemen, this is serious.
{44130}{44200}All the attempts we made to|arrest the Santa Claus gang
{44201}{44269}including a personal commando|operation carried out by myself
{44274}{44335}have failed, part of them because|of a over-zealous Émilien...
{44350}{44442}But nevermind, this is the past!|The future is ours! And we'll do...
{44443}{44525}what we decided yesterday|to do tomorrow, starting today!
{44527}{44574}You should write that down.|That's a good one...
{44575}{44635}Maybe a little twisted,|but I think it sounds good...
{44655}{44679}Émilien, your shoe's untied.
{44680}{44715}Yeah, it's just great...
{44725}{44770}That's good...|Ok... now, where was I?
{44771}{44790}At "this is serious", Chief!
{44794}{44825}Yes it IS serious!
{44830}{44960}And l won't accept any inopportune|mistakes or nauseous deviations!
{44962}{44990}Don't write that.
{44995}{45092}I want everything to be perfect,|smooth, "clean"! "Super-clean"!
{45115}{45182}You see, last summer l attended|a training seminar with the FBI...
{45183}{45255}so you see, some of the language|stuck... it's a reflex.
{45256}{45280}Crazy, eh?
{45310}{45330}... eh?...
{45349}{45414}So now I am giving you the "go"...
{45459}{45560}Not having caught the Santa gang|before Christmas is not an option!
{45604}{45685}Of course this means no|vacations, sick leaves...
{45686}{45720}Not even an excuse letter|from your parents!
{45740}{45862}Especially since miss Piu... Qiu,|journalist of the ...... magazine
{45863}{45910}Is giving us the honor of|following us on this mission.
{45911}{45995}So I hope she will return to her country|with a good opinion of our police!
{46010}{46060}The important words to|this mission are:
{46072}{46155}Concentration, Reflection...|...Action!
{46174}{46219}The codename for|this mission will be...
{46220}{46320}{Y:i}Operation "Snow-white"
{46349}{46395}Uh, that means|"Blanche-Neige" in French...
{46396}{46435}And guess who'll|play the dwarves...
{46437}{46474}Yeah... it's awesome...!
{46475}{46562}So from now on, I want each|and every one of you on alert 24/7!
{46563}{46600}{Y:i}So is this clear?
{46619}{46634}{Y:i}Questions?
{46635}{46648}Me!
{46649}{46657}{Y:i}You?
{46658}{46669}Oui!
{46670}{46680}Oh?
{46681}{46711}What's that gift|on your desk, Chief?
{46712}{46725}A gift?
{46741}{46800}Ooh! That's very kind.|Is that for my birthday?
{46802}{46831}Uh, when were|you born, Chief?
{46833}{46849}In July!
{46850}{46871}Must be for Christmas, then.
{46872}{46910}Whatever. It's the|intention that counts!
{47220}{47265}Well there's something new...
{47280}{47304}Very nice.|Who is it from?
{47305}{47349}Must be someone|that knows you well!
{47382}{47432}There's a little button on top...
{47440}{47450}Yes....?
{47530}{47560}Put the guns down!
{47579}{47612}Aah, it's wonderful...
{47630}{47721}Hey, you Pigs, this is Santa!|If you still believe in me, meet me
{47722}{47820}at the European Bank for your gifts.|But hurry up, we leave at noon!
{47879}{47912}Does anyone know|what time it is?
{47931}{47969}IT'S 5 TO 12, CHIEF!
{47970}{48090}RED ALEEERT!
{48154}{48249}I said "discreetly"! How am I|supposed to work with such jerks!
{48252}{48325}Those assholes... no no,|don't write this down, miss Qiu.
{48326}{48388}It's just a temporary reaction,|typical French - we fight sometimes
{48389}{48428}... however, we still mean it!
{48471}{48592}Gibert here. Deploy and await my signal.|Let us initiate... uh... well, let's go!
{48603}{48675}They will probably act like last time,|exit from the back in a fast car...
{48678}{48724}All we have to do is wait.|We'll catch them by surprise.
{48726}{48784}Chief... we won't surprise them|since THEY sent us the message?
{48785}{48881}Look, they sent us a message to fool us,|being certain we'd take it for a joke...
{48882}{48925}But that's counting without me,|Commissioner Gibert!
{48927}{48977}Commissioner Gibert is|not falling for their trap!
{48978}{49030}He is here, on time,|ready to attack!
{49032}{49125}I understand, Chief, but what if the|trap consisted in attracting us here?
{49126}{49201}Come on, think Émilien, think!|It doesn't make sense,
{49202}{49290}why would a gang alert the cops when|they are about to commit a crime?
{49291}{49325}I know, I know, that's|what's worrying me...
{49326}{49369}They haven't been acting stupidly|during the last eight months...
{49370}{49441}There's a first time for everything! And|particulary for stupidities, trust me!
{49442}{49462}Unless...
{49486}{49515}Unless what?
{49516}{49556}Unless they are certain|they'll manage to escape?
{49557}{49645}Hahaha... just let them try!|There's no escaping me, believe me!
{49672}{49688}Chief!
{49689}{49702}Yes?
{49945}{50010}They will have to pass over us|if they want to leave that bank!
{50102}{50145}What's that thing, there?
{50220}{50265}lt's... it's a nightmare!
{50824}{50850}Are you ok, Chief?
{50852}{50942}I'm fine, I'm fine! What are you|waiting for to start the pursuit?
{50943}{50980}How are we supposed to|stop a machine like that?
{50981}{51058}How should I know?|Show some initiative, damnit!
{51073}{51115}Alain, requisition a car!
{51226}{51274}That guy's got some nerve!|Why didn't he stop his car?
{51275}{51335}For a black cop in Marseille?|Fat chance!
{51336}{51402}Well yeah, but still... he could've|slowed down, at least!
{51424}{51505}It's OK! It's OK.|I'm used to it.
{51518}{51564}Chief, maybe we should requisition|one of our own cars!
{51565}{51625}Good thinking, Émilien.|GET IN THE CARS!
{51626}{51705}Now this is our new security system.|It's unique worldwide!
{51711}{51781}It's based on the "ATLAS"|system used by the police.
{51783}{51879}All you have to do is push this button|and the cops will get here ASAP.
{52041}{52070}It's really efficient!
{52362}{52404}Oh shit oh shit!
{52747}{52785}- Oh shit, my ride!|- Oh shit, my ride!
{53106}{53160}Maybe I should get off here,|you would lose some weight!
{53161}{53277}C'mon Émilien, your 50 lb won't make|a difference! And you, GO GO GO!
{53530}{53580}So here we are in the famous|Marseille harbour...
{53582}{53675}over there it's the "Cannelière",|taking it's name from cannabis...
{53676}{53720}you know, to make ropes...
{53721}{53800}it was built by King Louis XIV|in 1661 and... watch out!
{53818}{53854}What the fuck...?|Are you keeping up, son?
{53855}{53939}Certainly, sir! "...was built by|King Louis XIV in 1661"...
{53940}{54000}You don't have to follow what|I'm SAYING, you moron!
{54001}{54050}I'm talking about that big truck|with the big tires, there!
{54078}{54094}Oh dear oh dear...
{54095}{54169}See, my little coochie,|the problem is the staff!
{54170}{54220}They don't pay any attention|during recruiting!
{54221}{54291}For example this lad would make|an excellent swimming instructor,
{54292}{54392}but now he's in a car chase without|even having a driver's license!
{54394}{54445}Wha... what's that?|You don't have your license?
{54447}{54487}Well no, I only joined|the police yesterday!
{54488}{54514}I don't believe this!
{54515}{54590}Calm down, Émilien. All he has to do|is follow that big truck over there....
{54591}{54652}... piece of cake really, even a|swimming instructor could do it!
{54832}{54849}What do I do now?
{54850}{54895}You follow it, son,|just follow it!
{54980}{55029}That truck must be drinking|a gallon of gas per mile!
{55030}{55120}It'll run dry long before us!|I'd say in 5 or 10 minutes...
{55121}{55169}That's supposing we're|still alive in 5 minutes!
{55170}{55205}We will, we will...
{55974}{56044}Maybe we should stop and|apologize to these people...
{56045}{56114}There's a time for everything, Émilien.|Let's rush first, we'll apologize later...
{56115}{56150}But we're rather|CRUSHING right now...!
{56151}{56194}Stop your play on words,|Émilien! That's enough!
{56195}{56214}Am I supposed to stop now?
{56215}{56235}Huh? What for?
{56236}{56250}There's a swimming pool!
{56251}{56305}Yes, that might be a good...|STOP!
{56330}{56390}Phew... that was|really close, eh?
{56424}{56470}Hey! Watch it, there!
{56864}{56906}I knew we wouldn't|last 5 minutes...
{56907}{56990}See? That's some good insulation,|that is. Not a single leak!
{56995}{57064}Um... is this standard|procedure with the police?
{57065}{57125}Absolutely not! ln most of|cases, the cars leak...
{57176}{57239}Chief... I... I can't swim!
{57240}{57305}Oh, don't worry, Alain! We have|a swimming instructor with us...
{57962}{58022}Ah, my little Daniel!|What a pleasure to see you again.
{58035}{58065}Oh dear, you don't|look too good...
{58091}{58129}I think you're spending too much|time with my daughter.
{58130}{58225}Just kidding! At your age, it's|normal to have some fun...
{58226}{58285}Have you seen my driver by any chance?|He's running late...
{58286}{58350}l just saw him at the crossroad.|He'll be here in no time.
{58362}{58382}Glad to hear it!
{58389}{58425}Tell me, is Lily here|by any chance?
{58427}{58470}Yes, she is.|LILY!
{58471}{58515}I'm sorry darling,|I thought you were upstairs...
{58518}{58560}It's ok, daddy,|I'm used to it...
{58574}{58618}Look who is here...
{58619}{58662}Good morning Lily.|Can we talk for a minute?
{58667}{58745}Not now.|l have to go see my doctor...!
{58747}{58786}Can you drop me off Daddy,|it's on your way...
{58787}{58840}Sure, honey, if my driver|ever gets here...
{58842}{58906}Now that you mention it,|I thought he had some trouble...
{58909}{58960}Maybe I could drop you off...|both of you?
{58963}{58985}Affirmative.
{58990}{59075}It'll teach him to be late.|And now - all aboard!
{59183}{59221}To the Boulevard Cassini, driver.
{59223}{59250}Very well, Madam.
{59570}{59646}Tell me, you are late! Daniel|kindly offered to drive us,
{59648}{59710}so I'll meet you back at the|barracks after my appointment.
{59941}{59984}Tell me, didn't you use|to drive a bit faster?
{59986}{60059}Who, me? Well, there's a lot of people|on the streets this time of year...
{60060}{60135}and there's a lot of potholes,|so I can't drive very fast...!
{60136}{60208}Besides, taking things nice and easy|from time to time can't hurt...
{60210}{60270}Indeed, just so long as I'm not late...
{60337}{60370}What? What's wrong?
{60371}{60390}It hurts!
{60391}{60420}Where, honey?|What's hurting?
{60421}{60430}My belly...!
{60431}{60512}Your belly? But that's terrible!|What are we going to do, General?
{60513}{60570}I have no idea!|Does it hurt very badly, darling?
{60632}{60664}Noo - o.|It's over now.
{60665}{60688}It's over?
{60689}{60703}Yes, it's over.
{60708}{60765}It's over!|It's over... it's over...
{60920}{60994}Tell me Daniel, you're really a nervous|wreck today! What's wrong?
{60995}{61085}lt's because Christmas is nearing...|All those presents... makes me nervous.
{61086}{61165}l can see that... what's that|thing you got on your ear?
{61187}{61300}Oh that...? Nothing, it's just|a new gadget: a stress-o-meter!
{61306}{61360}One bar: nothing's wrong.|Two bars: nothing goes!
{61457}{61489}Well apparently,|nothing goes!
{61490}{61550}l know! That's why|I'm driving so slowly...
{61717}{61782}Thank you for driving,|it was a pleasant trip.
{61787}{61820}See you tonight, darling.
{61944}{62015}I'll touch a word to my doctor, but|I'm afraid your case is desperate...
{62145}{62220}Pardon me for intruding,|but I'm running late!
{62382}{62415}And here we go...
{62890}{62916}Come in.
{63000}{63024}Peek-a-boo!
{63025}{63047}Hello...
{63065}{63075}AAAH...!
{63180}{63203}Are you ok?
{63204}{63258}l'm fine...|I'm fine...
{63259}{63320}But you see, we're even betrayed|by our own equipment here!
{63321}{63350}How am I supposed|to work like that?
{63360}{63432}You should mention this in report.|We cruelly lack funding!
{63433}{63510}We need more stable chairs,|and taller doors - see?
{63513}{63570}Oh yeah, and we need|life jackets in our cars!
{63571}{63632}You were there earlier - blub!|See?
{63652}{63715}Besides, our shoes could be|more comfortable, too...
{63730}{63774}My feet hurt terribly!|Ouch!
{63805}{63839}Maybe if you removed this...?
{63840}{63852}Oh...?
{63860}{63922}Wonder who did that,|I hate those practical jokes!
{63941}{64030}I've had sore feet for six months!|That ain't funny!
{64040}{64080}You know, this makes|me all tense!
{64097}{64205}Just relax, commissioner!|You are so nervous.
{64212}{64285}lt's because of that gang,|the Santa Claus gang...
{64308}{64390}Don't worry about it...|I'm going to take care of you.
{64491}{64533}You know how to|use that thing?
{64541}{64580}Yes, a little bit...
{64586}{64700}They delivered it just last week.|Good thing I hid my typewriter!
{64772}{64830}Just relax, commissioner...
{64832}{64925}You'll feel better so much better...
{64926}{64950}You think so?
{64956}{64998}l am sure.
{65074}{65140}But now I can't see anything...|is that normal?
{65141}{65220}Yes, it's normal.|Just relax!
{65328}{65420}That feels so good... eh?
{65520}{65600}I feel like you're taking|all my worries away...
{65690}{65770}That's exactly the case...|You'll see...!
{65773}{65830}I think I'm falling asleep...
{65850}{65890}l'll wake you up.
{66163}{66190}That was terrific!
{66248}{66320}What the fuck do you think you're doing?|You have any idea where you are?
{66321}{66335}No, where am l?
{66336}{66368}ln front of the police station!
{66369}{66424}Oh, really? Looks more|like a garage to me...
{66425}{66460}Just you wait, buddy...
{66538}{66560}My respects, general!
{66563}{66578}At ease!
{66604}{66675}Thank you Daniel. l'll see you|tonight at home, then.
{66782}{66833}Oh, Daniel! You're my savior!
{66845}{66895}Could you do me a favor|and drop me somewhere?
{66896}{66939}I don't drop my friends, but I can|give you a ride if you want...
{66940}{66985}l am so glad to see you!
{67030}{67082}Please, sir?|Has the problem subsided?
{67084}{67114}Yes, I guess so...
{67115}{67205}Oh, and would you please keep this|parking spot for me, I'll be back...
{67215}{67235}Right...
{67354}{67395}Hey, hey, slow down,|I got plenty of time!
{67396}{67419}OK boss!
{67420}{67462}Daniel, you won't believe|what's happening to me.
{67463}{67502}Same here, you'll never guess|what's happening to me!
{67503}{67569}Try to guess... it's something|absolutely unbelievable!
{67570}{67589}You got promoted?
{67590}{67660}No it's not about my job,|it's personal... come on, guess!
{67661}{67672}You're getting married?
{67673}{67725}Better than that Daniel!|I'M GONNA BE A DADDY!
{67756}{67777}But that's impossible!
{67778}{67808}Yes it is possible!
{67820}{67852}Oh, it's wonderful...!
{67880}{67910}Lily is pregnant too.
{67930}{67955}No way!
{67982}{68065}But... that's awesome Daniel,|we'll be daddies together!
{68102}{68190}That's unbelievable... after all these|years of friendship, we'll...
{68197}{68235}we'll have a child together!
{68290}{68350}I mean... uh...|I mean, one each...
{68365}{68400}... but at the same time.
{68410}{68435}Each of us separately!
{68445}{68495}Yeah... separately, yes!
{68530}{68560}How long has she been pregnant?
{68562}{68580}8 months.
{68582}{68620}8 months?!|You could've told me earlier!
{68622}{68675}I only found out this morning!|You're the first one to know.
{68677}{68750}I haven't even told mommy yet!|What about you - how long?
{68767}{68784}2 bars.
{68801}{68820}What do you mean, "2 bars"?
{68822}{68870}Yeah, that's some new gadget...|you pee on it,
{68871}{68910}and it tells you how long|you've been pregnant.
{68912}{68955}And well, it's been|2 bars for her.
{68984}{69030}Oh yeah? That's cool.
{69060}{69085}Yeah, it's cool...
{69350}{69435}Commissioner...?|You've got visitors!
{69442}{69475}What are you doing, Gibert?
{69490}{69567}Aaah...!|It's a pleasure to see you again!
{69597}{69650}Uh... that's nothing...|We were simply... that is...
{69651}{69705}my colleague... she's Chinese...
{69714}{69765}She was just showing me|a relaxation technique...
{69766}{69830}How to get 5 hours of sleep|in 5 minutes... to save time.
{69831}{69880}It gives you a lot of energy!
{69902}{70000}However, today's class is over.|See you later, Commissioner!
{70001}{70030}Thanks.
{70074}{70115}Thanks, my little... Qiu.
{70217}{70260}So, what can l do for you?
{70331}{70415}She even put cauliflowers everywhere|in my office, but I was so busy...
{70416}{70465}I didn't even notice that!|How stupid can I be?
{70466}{70530}Very stupid,|but I had already noticed...
{70531}{70560}But why cauliflower?
{70580}{70665}What do I know? But I should at|least have noticed something...
{70666}{70725}But no, nothing!|I'm such a loser, Daniel...
{70726}{70810}Oh, stop it. If you were such a loser,|you wouldn't be the father!
{70812}{70830}You think so?
{70831}{70870}Of course! Petra|isn't masochistic...!
{70905}{70952}Thanks.|That's a bit reassuring.
{70953}{71030}Oh, don't be too reassured,|we're still in deep shit!
{71038}{71052}How's that?
{71053}{71105}Well, you're always|chasing thieves...
{71106}{71185}I'm always tinkering with an engine,|no wonder they're freaking out!
{71225}{71300}And I'm not an expert, but a kid|must need some room... and time!
{71320}{71394}Guess we'll have to change habits and|stop worrying only about our jobs...
{71395}{71462}You're right! We have to watch him|take his first steps, go to school...
{71555}{71599}Oh, really?|So we'll have to seal them all up?
{71600}{71620}I suppose so...
{71622}{71720}Oh...? That's just insane...|How can you prepare for it?
{71760}{71810}That's some good shit...|Did you get it from Rashid?
{71811}{71880}Yep... hold on, you know Rashid?
{71882}{71948}Well yeah, a little...
{71990}{72020}The sun is coming out...
{72180}{72272}Hey Daniel... Santa riding a scooter,|isn't that a bit weird?
{72325}{72360}Yeah... he's supposed|to ride a sleigh...
{72385}{72449}Watch this... he's discreet yet|nervous, that's not normal!
{72450}{72535}Hey... just 5 minutes ago we agreed|to stop worrying about the job
{72536}{72625}to spend more time with our kids,|so drop the hot pursuit idea!
{72630}{72650}Follow him!
{72652}{72695}Aye aye... Commissioner!
{73180}{73265}I need verification on a scooter,|registration N 75BM13, over.
{73340}{73370}It was stolen 2 weeks ago!
{73371}{73414}Yes! You see,|it pays to persevere!
{73415}{73460}You better tell Petra about it...
{73461}{73485}Daniel, we'll just follow it,
{73486}{73550}localize his HQ and hand the case|over to Gibert. You have my word!
{73570}{73585}Ok.
{73586}{73645}You're a real friend,.|What would I do without you?
{73646}{73675}Screw things up|even more?
{73676}{73705}Yeah, for sure...
{73836}{73890}We're losing him!|The first lead I got in 8 months,
{73891}{73925}and I'm fucking losing it!
{73930}{73990}Hey, calm down!|There's a solution to every problem.
{74010}{74045}Daniel, what are you doing...?
{74130}{74164}Daniel, what's wrong with you...!
{74165}{74210}You got a better idea|to follow a scooter?
{74219}{74284}Uh... no!|But we'll get noticed!
{74290}{74334}Just act naturally,|you'll be fine!
{74335}{74400}"Act naturally"?|Oh, alright...
{75150}{75234}So... now that you found his HQ,|you call the Commissioner!
{75235}{75325}Hold on. I screwed up last time,|this time I want to make sure!
{75327}{75429}Hey! You have a Santa, a stolen scooter|and an abandoned storehouse.
{75430}{75469}What more do you want?|His legal file?
{75470}{75535}I just want to make sure!|Come on, give me 5 minutes!
{75800}{75825}Bingo!
{75826}{75904}Is that enough, or you want to|check if they have real guns?
{75905}{75940}Nah, that's ok...
{75965}{76000}But we should find out|how many they are.
{76030}{76050}Follow me!
{76095}{76180}Will you stop it? You said that you'll|hand the case to the commissioner.
{76181}{76244}Yes, but the first question he'll ask|will be "how many are they?"
{76245}{76300}And I need to know if this is their|HQ or only a secondary base.
{76302}{76340}Come on, just give me 5 minutes!
{76800}{76854}Émilien, l got a bad feeling|about this. Don't do it!
{76855}{76935}Don't worry, I've seen it in a movie.|You force the body to do what you want.
{76936}{76955}It's all in your head.
{76956}{76995}I know, that's what worries me!
{77000}{77034}If something happens to|me, you call Gibert.
{77035}{77100}Émilien... your shoe's untied!
{77236}{77278}Oh dear...
{77425}{77440}Hello?
{77441}{77484}I'm back from my physician,|does that interest you?
{77498}{77545}Oh yes, if he's a good doctor!
{77546}{77580}He's an excellent doctor!
{77583}{77678}The prefect's daughter recommended him,|and she had 4 children in 4 years!
{77680}{77730}Well that's gonna be tough to beat...
{77731}{77770}Yes, especially if we don't|see each other again!
{77771}{77865}Listen Lily. I'll do anything, but|you should give me a chance!
{77870}{77899}So what I propose is...
{77900}{77940}Why are you whispering like that?
{77941}{77999}Because of the Santas! They just|pulled Émilen out of the trash can
{78000}{78035}and I think they're going to...
{78060}{78110}Lily? Lily!
{78135}{78160}Oh shit...
{78630}{78660}But... what are|you doing here?
{78680}{78700}Guess...
{78708}{78795}You're wasting your time.|Torture me, I won't say a word!
{78796}{78854}We do not need|to make you talk.
{78855}{78960}We already know everything.|Besides, torture is out of fashion.
{78980}{79074}There are much more effective|methods to make a man talking.
{79075}{79095}No kidding?
{79140}{79189}For example, tenderness...
{79220}{79280}lt can be a very|dangerous weapon.
{79310}{79394}Tell me, what is a handsome man|like you doing in a place like this?
{79395}{79450}Just doing my job...|Ah, no! Don't do that!
{79470}{79554}Yet you are not insensible|to my "arguments"...
{79555}{79598}Yes I am!|That's my cell phone!
{79600}{79650}Ah...? Let's have a look...
{79680}{79735}Oh, what a nice model!
{79760}{79819}But it's shut off...|I'm going to turn it on.
{79820}{79850}No!|You can't do that!
{79870}{79904}I'm out of credits...
{79910}{79945}That's against basic|human rights!
{80152}{80195}That's inhuman,|what you're doing to me...
{80236}{80295}They say hunger justifies the means...
{80300}{80365}and l am very hungry!
{80540}{80594}Petra!
{80595}{80695}Can't answer now because I'm very busy.|Leave your ID and I'll keep you posted.
{80702}{80800}Émilien, it's Petra. l guess you|are on a mission again.
{80840}{80890}I just wanted to tell you|that I am proud of you.
{80891}{80945}Of your dedication|to your work.
{80950}{81010}I know how you put all your|energy in everything you do.
{81020}{81072}But you should also think about|yourself from time to time.
{81086}{81150}You should relax a little,|find some pleasure in life.
{81170}{81235}And maybe we could spend|a little more time together...
{81241}{81325}That's all. Call me back|when you're done. Kiss!
{81441}{81465}Hello Daniel...!
{81580}{81644}Why are you still here? Have you|seen Émilien, I can't find him!
{81645}{81679}Actually I have seen him,|he got kidnapped!
{81680}{81729}Kidnapped?! You're kidding,|what good would that do?
{81730}{81790}What do I know! They were all disguised|as Santa and loaded with weapons!
{81791}{81830}Dressed as Santa? It must|be the Santa Claus gang!
{81840}{81869}I guessed that much...
{81870}{81920}Good job, Émilien! He picked up their|trail again - by himself!
{81921}{81939}Actually we BOTH did!
{81940}{82010}They're as good as dead!|I got an infaillible plan!
{82018}{82040}And Émilien?
{82055}{82100}He'll be fine Daniel, trust me!
{82159}{82182}Get in the car!
{82200}{82310}Would you mind sticking around with us?|I got a BAD feeling about this mission!
{82311}{82330}And Émilien?
{82340}{82360}Ah, Émilien...
{82380}{82420}Once we find the Santa Claus|gang, we find Émilien...
{82422}{82495}but... will he still be alive?|Who knows...
{82520}{82545}That's promising...
{82770}{82792}Commissioner!
{82795}{82825}Ah, good timing!
{82840}{82875}We're just about to catch|the Santa Claus gang,
{82876}{82955}we'll throw them right|into the sack, those Santas!
{82975}{83020}Can... can I come with you, please?
{83021}{83064}Absolutely not.|It's way too dangerous,
{83065}{83130}and this arrest won't be a pretty|Christmas story, trust me!
{83145}{83220}Oh, Commissioner... please...
{83225}{83280}Uh...? OK, let's go then,|it's not very far...
{83300}{83354}Hey!|Follow us, ok?
{83720}{83740}Spread out!
{83945}{83975}Yep, Christmas time is here!
{83976}{84062}I'm gonna hit them with some|early fireworks, wait and see!
{84068}{84099}How do you know they are here?
{84100}{84200}I got my own spies! My brother Jean-|Robert works with the City Sewage...
{84201}{84270}he took the police exam|with me, but failed...
{84271}{84302}even though he copied|everything off me!
{84303}{84395}but he messed up the order of the|answers, so he got it all wrong!
{84396}{84454}You know, that happens all the time!|A friend of mine...
{84455}{84479}Ok, ok, enough!
{84485}{84530}Anyway, he called me last night
{84531}{84615}and told me about suspicious activities|in the mall, so I investigated...
{84616}{84710}And what did I find? A tunnel|between the bank and the mall!
{84730}{84825}Of course! That way they'll steal|the money and spend it right away!
{84828}{84975}No! Sunday, they'll rob the CLOSED bank|and leave by the OPEN mall - as Santa!
{84976}{85037}Of course! Nobody will notice them|since there are Santas everywhere!
{85038}{85105}Exactly! And that's why they've been|dressing up as Santa from the beginning
{85106}{85160}in preparation of that hold-up!|It's the biggest bank in Marseille.
{85172}{85230}Of course, of course...!|Commissioner, you are a genius!
{85231}{85305}No, no, Alain... I got an inherent|talent, that's true...
{85312}{85360}but it's really just a|question of training.
{85380}{85402}It is!
{85408}{85434}Can l make a phone call?
{85435}{85455}Suit yourself!
{85500}{85545}Oh, ain't that funny,|Émilien's got the same one!
{85664}{85675}Yes.
{85685}{85731}{Y:i}The stupid cops|found out everything.
{85732}{85790}{Y:i}Switch to plan B.
{85810}{85850}- OK!|- OK. Bye.
{85868}{85925}That's such a nice language...|I mean, Chinese...
{85932}{85955}It just melts in your ear!
{85957}{85990}Chief, there's activity|in the parking lot.
{85991}{86095}On your marks. If that four wheeled|monster appears, nail it on the spot!
{86098}{86125}Roger that!
{86135}{86202}The Christmas vacation is over,|Gibert will make sure of that!
{86278}{86302}What the hell is that?
{86340}{86385}Hey, where's that|big monster truck?
{86440}{86520}They're getting away!|Do something!
{86550}{86615}l commandeer this vehicle.|Alain, follow me!
{87040}{87110}We have a beautiful view|over Marseille from here.
{87112}{87179}l see that. ls it quiet,|in wintertime?
{87180}{87202}Oh yes, very quiet.
{87203}{87225}STOP!
{87325}{87351}Commissioner, wait for me!
{87352}{87415}Stop... in the name of the Law!
{87430}{87515}Like I told you, Minister,|we are cruelly underfunded.
{87516}{87590}Indeed... one bike for two|officers, that's too little.
{87592}{87625}Way too little, yes...
{88932}{89002}Tell the chopper pilot|we'll be in time.
{89170}{89230}l will miss you,|my little Émilien...
{89240}{89315}But because l like you,|I won't make you suffer...
{89316}{89329}Gee, thanks...
{89330}{89445}You will even have the privilege to|know the exact time of your death
{89446}{89536}thanks to this highly precise|device... that's my Swiss side...!
{89760}{89905}This device will set free that ball,|which will swing along the cable...
{89906}{89975}and you'll have the|best seat for the show.
{89980}{90049}Uh... how much time will I have?
{90050}{90110}You'll have exactly 5 minutes.
{90125}{90140}Great...!
{90141}{90245}Use your time well to purify|your soul, Émilien...
{90246}{90340}It is important to thoroughly clean|your soul and come to peace...
{90341}{90400}before you face your Maker.
{90401}{90455}Only 5 minutes to clean up that|mess, that's a little tight there...
{90465}{90500}Focus on the essential, then...
{90692}{90755}I'm keeping your cell|phone as a souvenir.
{90770}{90810}I am a bit sentimental...
{90830}{90865}that's my Chinese side.
{91080}{91130}Clean up my soul...|Yeah, right...!
{91465}{91515}Right here and now, I would|sure appreciate a miracle!
{91525}{91545}Even a small one...!
{91720}{91755}Oh no, not the ball...!
{91784}{91810}Oh no, not the taxi!
{92023}{92115}Daniel! You can't imagine|what has happened to me.
{92118}{92210}lt was terrible, we must find her!|She took my cell phone...
{92230}{92285}I mean, they also got|all the money...
{92286}{92345}but the cell phone... that cell|phone was a gift from Petra!
{92346}{92415}Imagine what would happen if she|calls and a Chinese girl answers...
{92420}{92495}Uh, Émilien...? Tell me, did I just|save your life or was it a dream?
{92496}{92559}Well, yes... so what? I would've|done the same for you!
{92560}{92635}Oh yeah? That way I would have died|crushed by a cop car, that's great!
{92645}{92700}Don't say that. My driving|has improved a lot!
{92705}{92779}But your manners haven't! How about|saying "thank you for saving my life"?
{92780}{92855}If I don't catch that gang,|you saved my life for nothing.
{92860}{92910}Gibert will kill me because|I screwed up again!
{92914}{92989}We'll find that gang, but first,|tell me: ''Thank you''!
{92990}{93080}Oh yeah? How are we gonna find|it, we don't have a single clue!
{93081}{93110}Say: "Thank you"!
{93111}{93149}THANK YOU!|THERE, ARE YOU HAPPY?
{93150}{93176}YEAH!
{93298}{93355}l'm sorry, buddy.|I'm so sorry!
{93360}{93450}It's... it's my nerves, I just|can't take it anymore.
{93480}{93520}The Chinese girl, she...
{93535}{93605}She tortured me for hours,|it's hard to recover from it.
{93620}{93645}She tortured you?
{93646}{93690}Yes. lt was terrible!
{93730}{93750}What kind of tortures?
{93751}{93800}Oh my, she did things I didn't|even know you could do!
{93810}{93910}l mean, you can't imagine the things|she did. In fact I'm still sore...
{93940}{94005}I mean, it hurts me just|from talking about it, Daniel.
{94027}{94050}l see.
{94095}{94182}Don't worry... we'll catch that|Chinese chick. Come with me.
{94250}{94299}Did you see, did you overhear|anything that could help us?
{94300}{94315}No...
{94320}{94400}She was telling about a chopper pilot|set to pick them up somewhere, but...
{94410}{94440}She had fur on her boots.
{94441}{94465}Fur on her boots?
{94500}{94524}You don't feel anything?
{94525}{94540}No...
{94550}{94570}It's cold...
{94580}{94625}Oh yeah, you're right...|is that melted snow?
{94626}{94715}Yes. And that means two things.|It's from somewhere high up and nearby.
{94735}{94800}And... since they were wearing fur|boots, they're going back there...?
{94820}{94845}Probably...
{94855}{94910}But why would they take all that|money on a mountain top?
{94915}{94945}What's on the other side|of the mountain...?
{95015}{95045}Switzerland...
{95060}{95085}But of course!
{95090}{95155}Daniel, she's half Swiss,|so she knows the place!
{95160}{95219}They'll travel by car as high as|possible, then ski back down...
{95220}{95270}and what with all the tourists|there, nobody will notice them!
{95278}{95345}And from the Swiss ski station,|they're taking a chopper to the bank!
{95346}{95380}That plan is awesome!
{95435}{95500}So now we're looking for a ski station|that's close to the Swiss border...
{95501}{95580}where you can land a chopper|and has a lot of tourists.
{95630}{95665}- Val d'lsère!|- Val d'lsère!
{95895}{95919}Did you just see something?
{95920}{95955}No. Absolutely nothing.
{95970}{96035}Sentinel N1, negative.|Nothing to report here.
{96050}{96080}So where are you going|to spend your holidays?
{96081}{96150}Bof, we haven't decided yet...|Probably in the snow somewhere.
{96880}{96945}Now we can only hope that we|were right in our deductions...
{96950}{97004}and their car is around|here somewhere.
{97005}{97055}You look on the right,|I'll look on the left.
{97057}{97075}OK.
{97140}{97200}Émilien, don't tell me you can't|tell your right from your left!
{97202}{97265}Oh, you mean on|YOUR right side!
{97280}{97310}I'm in front of you,|so that's MY left...
{97312}{97355}You're not in front of me,|you're sitting besides me!
{97356}{97430}Yes, but I imagined I was sitting|in front of you, and if I was, I...
{97460}{97474}What...?
{97475}{97505}Daniel! The car!
{97530}{97545}Got'cha!
{97560}{97600}Let's take a shortcut, turn|right as soon as you can!
{97606}{97629}Why, you know this place?
{97630}{97710}Never mind, all these ski stations|are the same. Turn right, trust me!
{97711}{97780}Tell you what, I'd rather|trust myself and turn... right!
{97870}{97895}Watch out!
{98038}{98060}That was a close one!
{98110}{98135}What is this road, Daniel?
{98136}{98180}l don't know,|watch out for signs!
{98285}{98335}Don't these cars look a bit strange?
{98340}{98405}Nah, they're local plates...|Must be ski instructors...
{98406}{98435}What are those signs saying?
{98465}{98524}Says "1 min 10 sec, 2nd place"|Isn't that disturbing?
{98525}{98560}Not at all, we'll do better|on the second lap...
{99126}{99155}Oh shit...
{99156}{99205}Look, those tracks|are from a ratrack!
{99206}{99255}They must have transferred the|money into it and continued uphill.
{99270}{99319}We'll never catch them,|the pursuit is over!
{99320}{99355}The pursuit never stops.
{99480}{99570}Daniel, I know you're fast, but|a taxi can't climb a mountain!
{99580}{99615}Nothing is impossible|to a stout heart!
{99800}{99845}What do you think about|my winter collection?
{99890}{99920}Oh yeah, not bad at all!
{99940}{99964}Tell me, you've tested this, right?
{99965}{99985}No, never...
{100195}{100230}Hey, it seems to be working!
{100235}{100254}Yeah I guess so...
{100255}{100305}But how are we going to|find them in all that snow?
{100306}{100364}How about following|their tracks, for example?
{100365}{100415}Oh yes, that's a clever idea!
{100490}{100550}If they manage to escape in a chopper,|is your taxi equipped for that?
{100555}{100615}Émilien, don't overdo it! That's|already pretty good, don't you think?
{100616}{100685}Oh, I'm not complaining! But maybe|I should call the general, then...
{100690}{100720}What an excellent idea!
{100725}{100790}Uh, can I borrow your cell phone?|The Chinese girl still got mine...
{100940}{101045}Put the money into the rucksacks.|We must leave before sundown.
{101270}{101290}{Y:i}Back to work!
{101500}{101525}You think they are still there?
{101535}{101560}That's hard to say...
{101690}{101705}Hello?
{101708}{101779}Oh, Émilien! Operation ''Snow-white''|has already started.
{101780}{101874}I'll be with you in 10 minutes.|Your Commissioner is with me,
{101875}{101920}he insisted to participate|in the operation!
{101925}{101960}Oh, no...!
{101990}{102020}- Commissioner!|- Yes?
{102035}{102070}Are you sure that's a good idea?
{102100}{102174}Alain, l served for 18 months|in the Chasseurs Alpins,
{102175}{102279}13th batallion, special forces!|So I know about mountains!
{102282}{102335}Alright, but... we are high up here!
{102336}{102375}Have you ever seen|snow before, Alain?
{102380}{102420}Well... you know,|I'm from around here...!
{102445}{102500}Ah...? Oh.|Ok then, let's go!
{102540}{102565}Ok, hit the road!
{102595}{102639}I'm going to take a look.|Don't want to take chances.
{102640}{102664}I wouldn't do that|if I were you...
{102665}{102695}Relax, just give|me 5 minutes...
{102749}{102800}Damn it - it's always|the same story!
{103015}{103072}You were right.|We should stay together.
{103180}{103245}See that? You could have waited|instead of ruining my carpet...
{103246}{103272}Take it easy, it's just water!
{103273}{103344}No, for now it's still snow,|and snow leaves traces!
{103345}{103374}Alright, I'll clean up|your fucking car!
{103375}{103409}Oh yeah? How are you|gonna do that?
{103410}{103500}l said, l'll clean it!|How, is my problem!
{103680}{103705}Come on! Let's go.
{103828}{103849}You know how to ski?
{103850}{103875}No, but I know|how to drive!
{105590}{105640}Damn it!|Follow me!
{105735}{105769}Hey! lt's a forest, Daniel!
{105770}{105799}So what? Are you scared in a forest?
{105800}{105830}No, I'm scared in a car!
{105930}{105975}Uh... what... what are|you doing, Daniel?
{105985}{106030}Well, I think I can put|the tires back on now...
{106150}{106215}There, we localized the chopper!|Get ready!
{106305}{106339}Chief! Are you sure that...?
{106340}{106425}Shut up Alain, I checked everything|myself this time. I'll be just fine!
{106430}{106472}Ok boys, here we go!
{107020}{107040}What happened?
{107165}{107205}Wait for me-e-aah!
{107476}{107534}I think the cord is|a little too short...
{107535}{107580}Of course it's too short!
{107650}{107675}Wait, you can't do that!
{107676}{107705}Oh yeah? Watch me!
{107785}{107800}There we go.
{107825}{107865}Wait for me...!
{108080}{108195}And here comes Hans Gerhardt,|from Austria, he's the number 10...
{108196}{108235}in a great shape this season...
{108280}{108325}Are you sure we're on the road?
{108326}{108385}I think that as long as we|follow these poles, we're good...
{108402}{108500}After his record in Kitzbühl and|on this optimal race track,
{108505}{108580} it's hard to think of anybody|that could outrace him...
{108690}{108775}He has set a record|on all intermediary times...
{108845}{108920}He is literally flying across|this World Championship...
{109060}{109130}This victory cannot escape him...
{109210}{109308}Ooops - it did. A... taxi...|beats him by a split-second.
{109715}{109745}lt's too calm...
{110175}{110220}You could leave me|a little souvenir...
{110221}{110265}Souvenirs aren't allowed|where you're headed to.
{110270}{110315}However, you will have|plenty of time to clean up!
{110360}{110385}Ok, take her away!
{110490}{110590}Tell me, you don't seem to be very angry|considering she tortured you for hours!
{110620}{110659}Well... bygones are|bygones, right?
{110660}{110670}Sure...
{110671}{110734}Oh, by the way, you haven't seen|Gibert? Shouldn't he be here?
{110735}{110765}{Y:i}l'm coming!
{110766}{110800}Well yeah, there he is!
{110805}{110884}O-oh! l am comi-i-ng!
{110885}{110955}Chief! Be careful when|you're landing!
{110960}{111035}Oh, don't worry Émilien,|it's just snow...
{111055}{111100}Banzai...!
{111155}{111205}Oh dear... the water must|be pretty cool, too!
{111400}{111415}Hello!
{111417}{111480}Émilien? My waters broke,|I'm about to give birth!
{111482}{111534}What, you're giving birth?|Here? Right now?
{111535}{111569}Well it's gonna take some|time, but hurry up!
{111570}{111625}I'm coming Petra!|I'll be there right away!
{111710}{111760}Commissioner!|Petra is having a baby!
{111785}{111830}And guess who's getting|another job...
{111835}{111860}Daniel!
{112020}{112120}l'm here, l'm here!|Everything will be fine now.
{112140}{112210}I beg you, please don't faint!|It's not the right time for this!
{112211}{112295}Don't worry, everything be fine.|You hear me? You'll be fine!
{112355}{112400}Émilien, that's not the right time!|You gotta cope with this!
{112438}{112500}Watch over the monitor.|You'll see the contractions coming.
{112502}{112550}- I'll see contractions on a screen?|- Yes.
{112555}{112620}Watch a screen, watch a screen...|which one shows contractions?
{112622}{112649}It must be this one...
{112685}{112700}Yes, it's that one!
{112701}{112725}Push! Push!
{112730}{112760}But where do I push?
{112761}{112820}Not you! She has to push|at every contraction!
{112830}{112850}Contractions!
{112876}{112940}Push, honey, push, push!
{112945}{112985}Now breathe, breathe!
{113020}{113080}Not you! She has to breathe!
{113081}{113135}Breathe darling, breathe, breathe!
{113180}{113200}Contractions!
{113215}{113279}Push! Push!
{113280}{113305}Get out of here!
{113306}{113394}Push! Get it out of here!|Come on, push, push!
{113395}{113414}Now breathe...
{113415}{113505}Ok, breathe!|Man the bellows, breathe, breathe!
{113578}{113614}Ok, one more time,|I can see the head!
{113615}{113645}The head...?
{113646}{113670}Contractions, Émilien!
{113671}{113790}Ok darling, push the head!|Push the head! Push it outta there!
{113791}{113815}Contractions!
{113830}{113854}Almost there!
{113855}{113964}One more time my love, push!|Push! Breathe! Sneeze! Puke!
{113965}{114005}Ok, now relax.
{114070}{114125}Relax, relax, relax...
{114160}{114195}It's a beautiful baby boy.
{114200}{114225}Relax everything...
{114435}{114470}I'm a daddy...
{114550}{114585}Would you like to cut|the umbilical cord?
{114655}{114730}Maybe we should wait a little|with that if you don't mind...
{115150}{115180}What are you doing here?
{115182}{115205}Training...
{115220}{115250}Why? Are you pregnant?
{115260}{115300}No, but the woman|l love is pregnant.
{115320}{115360}And I want to be ready|when my time comes.
{115395}{115490}Where did you find a woman stupid enough|to have a baby with a draft of air?
{115492}{115585}l was very lucky.|And I promised her things.
{115590}{115620}Like what?
{115635}{115734}To spend more time with her than with|my car, to become the best of daddies...
{115735}{115750}And the fridge?
{115751}{115770}The fridge is empty!
{115780}{115870}I would also be the best of husbands,|if she agrees to marry me, that is...
{115900}{115920}And did she believe you?
{115925}{115945}Not at all!
{115965}{116024}In fact, it's the first time in her life|that she made a real mistake.
{116045}{116085}Because right now,|I was absolutely sincere.
{116150}{116220}What men lack is not sincerity,|it's the time to apply it.
{116235}{116290}The time to make all these|nice words possible.
{116330}{116370}Lily, would you marry me?
{116395}{116455}That's easy, now that you made me|pregnant, you feel compelled...
{116458}{116475}Lily!
{116510}{116605}In any case, you're not doing it right.|We are very traditional in our family!
{116700}{116765}Lily, would you give me the|honour to become my wife?
{116800}{116820}It depends...
{116830}{116855}Depends on what?
{116878}{116915}On how good of|a lover you are...
{116945}{116969}You got one hour|to convince me!
{116970}{116995}You'll never last!
{117005}{117030}Wanna bet?
{117055}{117120}"Intensive care"
{117285}{117320}Émilien...
{117365}{117415}Émilien!
