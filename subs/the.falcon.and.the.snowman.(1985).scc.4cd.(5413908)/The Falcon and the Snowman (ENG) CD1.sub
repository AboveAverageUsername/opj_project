{10218}{10303}- How long have you been in Mexico?|- Just for the summer.

{11971}{12033}- Hi, Chris. Long time no see!|- He up yet?
{12036}{12085}Hah! What do "you" think?
{12753}{12836}Daulton Lee, we've got you surrounded!
{13044}{13093}Who's there? Don't move!
{13096}{13145}It's me! It's me! Don't shoot!
{13148}{13207}Chris? Chris, stay down!
{13210}{13282}- They got us surrounded!|- No! I was joking!
{13285}{13336}I was just kidding! Just kidding.

{13535}{13595}Yes, I'm looking very well. So are you.
{13616}{13693}- Aw!|- Oh. Sorry about that.
{13696}{13766}Plop! Little does it know!
{13859}{13922}You write a friend a letter,|you expect a response.
{13925}{13979}- That's the way it works.|- Good to see you.
{13982}{14056}Good to see "you," but I'm serious.|I take it very personally.
{14059}{14129}- I write very few letters.|- I wanted to surprise you.
{14132}{14171}Uh-huh.
{14223}{14290}This isn't a visit. I'm back for good.
{14293}{14411}Changed my mind. No seminary.|Just couldn't go through with it.
{14465}{14555}What have you been up to?|Pass the cantaloupe.
{14623}{14657}Is this a bad joke?
{14660}{14743}I thought you'd congratulate me|for coming to my senses.
{14746}{14886}You're wrong! How many guys do you|know whose best friend is also his priest?
{14889}{14978}I mean, I could've gone to confession|and told the truth!
{14981}{15060}- I'm disappointed.|- When did you last go to confession?
{15063}{15112}That's irrelevant.
{15182}{15256}- Did you tell your folks?|- They don't know I'm back yet.
{15259}{15323}Oh! Oh, that'll be interesting!
{15360}{15420}{Y:i}The committee recommended|the impeachment
{15423}{15477}{Y:i}of President Nixon, charging that
{15480}{15603}{Y:i}he acted in a manner contrary to|his trust as President and subversive...
{15606}{15692}I don't care what these people say.|The man is innocent!
{15695}{15748}- Right, Dad?|- Keep it up.
{15760}{15803}Maggie, the garbage.
{15806}{15901}You gotta give me this moment!|I may never be right about anything again!
{15904}{15963}You find this amusing?
{15989}{16034}Hardly.
{16037}{16086}Dad, it's for you!
{16134}{16183}- "Mr Waldie."|- "Aye."
{16212}{16257}- "Mr Flowers."|- "Aye."
{16302}{16351}- "Mr Mann."|- "Aye."
{16354}{16418}- "Mr Sarbanes."|- "Aye."
{16480}{16504}{Y:i}Mr Wiggins.
{16507}{16546}- No.|- "No."
{16549}{16598}- "Mr Moorhead."|- "No."
{16601}{16645}It's unbelievable.
{16648}{16702}You'll call Father Glenn today?
{16738}{16769}Mm-mm.
{16793}{16902}- It won't hurt to talk to him.|- Ma, it's not gonna accomplish anything.
{16946}{16995}You don't know that.
{17049}{17109}You remember Tony Owens' son Gary?
{17127}{17196}- Careful, Dad. Careful.|- I'm sorry.
{17199}{17310}I hired him last summer. I let his old man|know the time had come to reciprocate.
{17313}{17337}Well?
{17340}{17401}If you have a better idea,|I'd love to hear it.
{17404}{17471}I don't think you have|the faintest clue what to do.
{17474}{17557}- Well, you could ask!|- I'm asking.
{17639}{17678}Here.
{17697}{17783}You're to report 9 o'clock|Monday morning.
{17786}{17849}Here is $10.
{17852}{17901}Get yourself a haircut.
{17943}{18031}I don't know what this is, Coach,|but... I'm sure it's great!
{18034}{18068}You're welcome, son.
{18075}{18133}{Y:i}RTX Credit. Authorisation code, please.
{18184}{18261}Yes, we show derogatories -|credit and criminal.
{18602}{18651}- You're early.|- "You're" late.
{18706}{18755}Chris.
{18810}{18861}Chris Boyce - Larry Rogers.
{18864}{18943}- How's it going?|- OK. Pretty good. How are you doing?
{18946}{19073}I've been saying to Larry that we'd better|make things more interesting for you
{19076}{19125}or we'll lose you.
{19145}{19227}- Going back to school?|- Yes, sir. I plan to next year.
{19230}{19276}- Medicine.|- Law.
{19279}{19390}Yeah, that's right. Right. That's excellent.|That's excellent, huh?
{19550}{19614}I don't know your father.
{19617}{19697}He's Director of Security|over at Strata Research.
{19700}{19758}- Retired FBI.|- Yeah, I know.
{19884}{19928}Good.
{20039}{20088}That's good.
{20350}{20401}- Debra.|- Oh, hi!
{20404}{20453}- Hi. You got a minute?|- Sure.
{20479}{20536}Get out my personal file, please.
{20568}{20686}- Chris, you know I can't do that.|- I won't tell anyone, I promise. Please?
{20689}{20768}- Come on...|- I don't have your access code.
{20848}{20897}I owe you one.
{21288}{21332}Wait a second.
{21364}{21423}"File closed. Under review."
{21548}{21652}We've been checking into your|background for some time, Mr Boyce.
{21655}{21719}You're quite an impressive young man.
{21797}{21874}Do you ever hear anybody|talking about birds here?
{21877}{21926}Birds?
{21948}{21972}No, sir.
{21975}{22041}The Black World?|At lunch? Or in the men's room?
{22044}{22145}You never overheard anybody|mentioning Black World projects?
{22148}{22211}- Just gossip.|- No, sir.
{22232}{22289}Know why that is?
{22313}{22362}They don't exist.
{22382}{22476}At least, not as far as anyone without|government clearance is concerned.
{22479}{22583}Do you want to do me a favour|and sign this piece of paper for me?
{22822}{22881}It's backwards.
{23122}{23273}The Black World is a codename for|a family of covert surveillance satellites.
{23292}{23423}Conceived by the Defense Department,|manufactured and maintained by RTX,
{23426}{23513}and used primarily by a company|you may have heard of
{23516}{23615}- in Langley, Virginia.|- Central Intelligence.
{23653}{23785}Circling the earth with their cameras,|heat sensors, microwave antennas,
{23788}{23890}they've significantly lightened|the workload of human spies.
{23909}{24026}When Brezhnev chats with his mistress|over his supposedly clean phone,
{24029}{24078}the birds listen in.
{24081}{24140}When he walks his dog in the park,
{24143}{24228}the birds take a picture of it|pissing on the shrubbery.
{24231}{24294}When he tests his latest warhead
{24297}{24393}underground somewhere in Siberia|and claims he hasn't,
{24396}{24446}the birds know he's lying.
{24513}{24604}{Y:i}You'll be working|in the system's nerve centre.
{24607}{24705}{Y:i}A communications vault linking RTX|and our associates in Virginia
{24708}{24777}{Y:i}with tracking stations|all around the world.
{24780}{24859}{Y:i}Alaska, Guam, Iceland, Australia,|to name a few.
{24878}{24944}{Y:i}You'll be dealing with correspondence
{24947}{25018}{Y:i}that relates to the activities|of the satellites.
{25021}{25115}{Y:i}Correspondence that you will find|designated top secret.
{25118}{25212}{Y:i}It's protected by sophisticated|cryptographic equipment
{25215}{25289}{Y:i}developed by|the National Security Agency.
{25317}{25385}{Y:i}You're not to discuss|any aspect of yourjob
{25388}{25459}{Y:i}with non-cleared RTX employees.
{25479}{25528}This is as far as I can go.
{25594}{25676}{Y:i}Not with your girlfriend.|Not with your parents.
{25679}{25729}{Y:i}Not with your dog.
{25732}{25802}{Y:i}Not in the men's room, not over lunch.
{25805}{25854}{Y:i}Not in your sleep. Nowhere.
{25882}{25931}{Y:i}Are we clear so far?
{26580}{26629}Miss.
{26632}{26716}I'm not the secretary.|There is no secretary.
{26760}{26884}Uh... I think somebody might've made|a mistake. Is this the black vault?
{26911}{26965}No, but you're getting warm.
{27101}{27149}The vault's over there.
{27347}{27396}- Aw, fuck!|- Excuse me.
{27399}{27477}- Mr Norman?|- Who the hell are you?
{27480}{27533}Boyce. Supposed to start working here.
{27536}{27609}Who says you're supposed|to start working here exactly?
{27612}{27682}Well, I was briefed by Larry Rogers.
{27685}{27739}He didn't tell you?
{27804}{27908}You were supposed to show me|how to work the machines, I guess.
{28030}{28129}Larry, this is Gene. I got this kid -|supposed to be working here?
{28132}{28201}{Y:i}Don't get excited, Gene. I sent him over.
{28204}{28251}Uh-huh.
{28254}{28310}Sure, but nobody tells me anything.
{28313}{28387}- "I'm telling you now."|- Yeah, OK. Yeah.
{28439}{28488}- We're working together.|- Yeah.
{28491}{28584}Well, you didn't tell me that, did you?|I thought maybe I was...
{28665}{28735}- So, you want a margarita?|- Pardon me?
{28738}{28795}You want a margarita?
{28925}{29001}That'll be your desk over there...|What was your name?
{29004}{29052}- Chris.|- Gene.
{29062}{29139}- Gene.|- You're gonna love it here, Chris.
{29171}{29220}Nobody can mess with you here.
{29223}{29308}Nobody's got clearance to get in.|Not even Security.
{29366}{29471}Can you turn that thing off for me?|Giving me a fuckin' headache!
{29549}{29598}Thanks.
{29659}{29738}Yeah! Just the three of us.
{29741}{29790}You and me and Laurie.
{29810}{29854}- Oh, hi, Laurie.|- Hi.
{29857}{29921}- Want a margarita?|- No. Maybe later.
{29924}{30023}Good. There's not enough anyway.|Ran out of salt. Cheers.
{30095}{30209}I'm surrounded by junkie partners who|turn me in the minute they get in trouble.
{30212}{30276}I don't trust any of them. I'm all alone.
{30296}{30365}Would you stop that? This is serious!
{30368}{30438}How much are they paying you|or is that a big secret?
{30441}{30500}Uh, 140 a week, before taxes.
{30503}{30584}Do you know what I'm offering you?|Do you know what I make?
{30587}{30648}- Ten times that.|- Easy. It's about to double.
{30651}{30726}I'm this far away|from a truly amazing connection.
{30736}{30796}I'll split it with you 50-50,|down the middle.
{30799}{30848}Jesus! Nine iron.
{30903}{30954}- We'll be rich!|- We're already rich.
{30957}{31011}No. I mean "rich."
{31014}{31109}Hey, he who dies with the most toys wins.
{31112}{31166}That way... is the green.
{31181}{31232}I can't believe you're not interested.
{31235}{31339}I'm flattered I'm the only one you trust,|but I'm really not interested.
{31342}{31391}Fore!
{31668}{31743}{Y:i}That's the Average White Band -|"Pick Up The Pieces".
{31746}{31798}{Y:i}I'm your host Johnny Crystal.
{33603}{33730}{Y:i}"Allow union infiltrators|sufficient lead time."
{33733}{33792}{Y:i}Union infiltrators?
{33833}{33952}{Y:i}"Though CIA exposure seems unlikely,|standard programme of denial
{33955}{34004}{Y:i}is recommended."
{34120}{34223}{Y:i}Standard programme of denial|recommended.
{35542}{35610}Happens all the time.|We're all in the same system.
{35613}{35692}They screw up, we get their cables.|We screw up, they get ours.
{35695}{35745}You haven't heard anything about this?
{35748}{35817}No. I really wouldn't worry about it.
{35859}{35913}- Eddie would know. Want me to ask him?|- No.
{35916}{35945}Why not?
{35948}{36068}Eddie. Eddie! What do you know about|a covert operation in Australia?
{36071}{36120}- Chris wants to know.|- Which one?
{36123}{36233}- Something about labour unions.|- Air-traffic controllers.
{36236}{36295}It's nothing. They're threatening to strike.
{36298}{36380}If they do, it'd stop our personnel|and equipment into Pine Gap.
{36394}{36443}Don't worry. It's under control.
{36482}{36579}Like Whitlam! They've been saying|he's under control for two years!
{36582}{36624}- Who's Whitlam?|- Prime Minister.
{36627}{36705}I don't know why somebody doesn't|just blow up his fuckin' car.
{36708}{36757}That's why you're just a clerk.
{36760}{36822}I'm serious, man! You make it obvious!
{36825}{36899}You fuck with us,|you accept the consequences.
{36902}{37026}Anything less than that is a waste|of time and the taxpayers' money!
{37029}{37086}College boys running things...
{37089}{37157}Princeton boys!|Faggots afraid to get their hands wet!
{37160}{37209}- Getting that look.|- Fuck you!
{37212}{37254}Anytime, anywhere.
{37257}{37335}The man is a communist!|We're letting him walk all over us!
{37338}{37439}You know, I killed 14 of 'em myself!|Personally!
{37442}{37508}- That right? College boys?|- Communists!
{37511}{37610}Special Ops. Laos.|Close range, right between the eyes!
{37655}{37755}- All right.|- You don't believe me, do you?
{37758}{37803}- I believe you.|- You don't.
{37806}{37900}- Lighten up, Gene.|- The war's over, Gene. Spare us.
{37990}{38044}Believe it, college boy.
{39588}{39612}Wasn't done.
{39615}{39682}Why didn't you tell me|your old man was FBI?
{39685}{39741}Well, cos he isn't any more.
{39744}{39838}Once FBI, always FBI. He's all right.
{39855}{39940}Larry Rogers, this is Charlie Boyce.|This is Chris's dad.
{39943}{40010}- Good to meet you. My wife Barbara.|- Hello, Barbara.
{40147}{40201}- What are you doing up?|- Oh.
{40273}{40367}Having a brandy. Want one?
{40370}{40432}What are "you" doing up?
{40452}{40507}Come, sit.
{40510}{40559}Come. Come on.
{40700}{40802}Jeffrey's been given an assignment|at school to memorise a poem.
{40819}{40927}He asked me to suggest one to him.|Sound familiar?
{40968}{40995}Yeah.
{41051}{41155}Half a league, half a league,|Half a league onward...
{41307}{41353}I can't remember it.
{41356}{41437}- I don't believe you.|- Give me the book...
{41518}{41567}I can't remember it. I'm sorry.
{41570}{41673}Do you really resent me as much as|you want me to think you do?
{41694}{41805}Lmagine what that must feel like. You say|more with a look than you realise.
{41808}{41886}Whatever else you think about me,|I am not blind...
{41889}{41939}- I gotta get up early.|- Sit down!
{41942}{42008}- I don't wanna fight with you!|- Just talk to me!
{42011}{42076}- I'm getting an apartment cos...|- Aw!

{42361}{42440}Half a league, half a league,|Half a league onward,
{42455}{42509}All in the valley of Death|Rode the six hundred.
{42512}{42555}"Charge!" was the captain's cry,
{42558}{42649}Their's not to reason why,|Their's but to do and die:
{42687}{42761}And into the valley of Death|Rode the six hundred.
{43253}{43311}I'll sweep across into Southern Europe.
{43314}{43398}You come from England and Africa.|Hit his north and west borders.
{43401}{43450}What do "I" get out of it?
{43453}{43543}- What do you want?|- I wanna keep North America.
{43756}{43840}Let's go, Chris!|You're being attacked!
{43843}{43893}Yeah, I'll be right there.
{44288}{44389}Chris, I'm attacking you from Egypt.|I'm coming into Southern Europe.
{44392}{44481}- Want me to roll for you?|- Yeah. How many armies do I have?
{44484}{44533}Three.
{44559}{44613}And you've just lost two more.
{44616}{44710}Now I'm hitting you from Britain.|I'm coming into Northern Europe.
{44856}{44954}I'm going into the Ukraine.|You're gonna be wiped out soon.
{44957}{45011}There goes the Ukraine.
{45169}{45272}Every day I get these misrouted cables -|the CIA's secret mail.
{45275}{45394}Details of covert action that have|nothing to do with national security.
{45397}{45511}Manipulations of foreign press,|political parties, whole economies.
{45514}{45563}It's incredible.
{45566}{45676}I had no idea the extent of the lie,|the level of deception.
{45689}{45762}Australia's not our only ally|being deceived.
{45765}{45900}Woo-hoo! I've got a house to show.|Lock up if you leave.
{45962}{46075}Know what I think? You really wanna|hurt 'em, really do some damage?
{46118}{46214}- Make it public. "New York Times."|- No, no, no.
{46217}{46313}- I'm talking about a big exposÈ.|- It's already public!
{46316}{46367}What happened in Chile was public.
{46370}{46441}People "still" don't believe|we engineered that!
{46444}{46544}- Allende was a socialist.|- He "was" elected.
{46578}{46634}People see what they want to see.
{46637}{46691}- It's unbelievable.|- Well...
{46713}{46827}I don't know what's going on with you,|but this is insane. It's wrong.
{46830}{46889}It took a lot of trust|to come to you with this.
{46892}{47017}If you can't see this is wrong,|then you're further gone than I thought.
{47020}{47107}You're a drug dealer! How can you|tell me what's right and wrong?
{47110}{47212}You wanna say that louder?|I don't think the neighbours heard you.
{47234}{47338}You wanted to be partners.|I'm offering you a partnership.
{47341}{47413}Look at it as one of|your business transactions
{47416}{47502}and you won't have any trouble with it,|I promise you.
{47505}{47616}Did it ever occur to you that maybe|you're seeing what "you" want to see?
{47619}{47675}It's worth significant money.
{47790}{47848}I don't want anything to do with it.
{47873}{47932}- What are you smiling at?|- A patriot?
{47962}{48016}And proud of it.
{48050}{48099}Come on in!
{48265}{48314}Matt, this is Clay.
{48317}{48421}This is Daulton. Dale!|I got a room upstairs.
{48553}{48656}Excuse me. Nothing personal.|He's just gotta check you out, OK?
{48667}{48716}Sure.
{49218}{49267}Go ahead.
{49270}{49319}Don't mind if I do!
{49543}{49634}Accuracy. I didn't come here to party.
{49673}{49722}Nothing personal.
{49767}{49842}- Where are you from exactly?|- Orange County.
{49845}{49910}- Where exactly?|- Irvine.
{49942}{49992}Not bad!
{49995}{50044}Not bad.
{50115}{50164}What's that?
{50186}{50228}Sh!
{50290}{50339}What's that?
{50424}{50508}- What's that noise, lke?|- I don't know.
{50601}{50672}- Police officers!|- Fuckin' cop!
{50797}{50890}- Hands up where I can see them!|- Hold it right there!
{50968}{51036}Just meet with him|wearing a concealed microphone.
{51039}{51140}Have a drink, record the transaction.|That's it. That's all we need.
{51143}{51240}- What protection can he expect?|- Your client can't expect anything!
{51243}{51371}If this prick opens his mouth again,|this conversation is over. You got that?
{51374}{51451}Now, what kind of protection|can my client expect?
{51454}{51570}At no time while you're wired are you|out of reach of armed assistance, OK?
{51573}{51667}If I can't guarantee your safety,|I don't let you wear it.
{51692}{51789}I would like to discuss this|with my attorney in private.
{51792}{51841}Jesus!
{51977}{52033}I work for them and I am a dead man!
{52036}{52101}I set up one buy and that's it!|I won't last...
{52104}{52211}They are not talking about six months|in some minimum-security work camp.
{52214}{52295}- They are talking about San Quentin.|- I understand.
{52298}{52352}I am not an informer, all right?
{52365}{52447}That is against my principles|and I am "not" going to prison!
{52450}{52574}- That's the only two choices you got!|- The only two choices I've got?
{52664}{52758}You tell them anything you want,|but get me outta here on bail tonight.
{52952}{53028}They'll know what this stuff is?|I'm not gonna have to...
{53031}{53088}- They'll know exactly what it is.|- Huh?
{53111}{53197}They'll know exactly what it is|and this... this is if you get that far.
{53200}{53269}- There you go.|- All right.
{53301}{53350}What's it worth?
{53353}{53466}How should I know how much it's worth?|Get whatever you can. Haggle with them.
{53533}{53582}What?
{53624}{53668}I just walk in there?
{53671}{53747}Yeah. I mean,|what are they gonna do - shoot you?
{53750}{53811}They might. You don't know.
{53829}{53888}You don't even know the address.
{53930}{53984}Hey, there's one thing.
{54004}{54102}Look at me. Whatever you do,|don't tell them my name.
{54105}{54173}All right? That's for your own protection.
{54176}{54277}As soon as you tell them my name,|they won't need you any more.
{54315}{54379}It's not too late to back out.
{54405}{54464}Just tell me.
{56300}{56364}This is interesting. What is it?
{56982}{57051}- I'm the courier.|- The courier?
{57114}{57247}American spy satellites. I can get you|all the information you wanna know.
{57346}{57411}- Sputniks.|- Yes?
{57478}{57569}- Maybe I'm talking to the wrong guy.|- Who would be the right guy?
{57572}{57659}- KGB.|- This is an embassy. No KGB here.
{57700}{57749}Oh, well,
{57752}{57802}whatever you say.
{57854}{57903}One moment, please.
{57951}{58023}The card has something|to do with satellites, yes?
{58026}{58098}- That's right.|- So you're a spy.
{58142}{58195}That's right.
{58198}{58255}Do you have some identification?
{58470}{58538}- Thank you.|- You're welcome.
{58907}{58974}Testing. One, two, three. Testing.
{59285}{59349}Just looking for an ashtray here.
{59442}{59501}- That's not a candy dish?|- No.
{59504}{59553}It's an ashtray.
{59673}{59727}You got a nice office here.
{59758}{59858}I like the rug. I'm kind of an expert|on rugs. Pakistani, right?
{59894}{59943}I wouldn't know.
{60242}{60364}My associates are not so sure about|the authenticity of your calling card.
{60383}{60460}Oh, really? Here's the deal.|Got your notebook handy?
{60569}{60594}Good.
{60597}{60661}I got a friend in LA|who works for the government.
{60664}{60713}He's not real crazy about the CIA.
{60716}{60800}The deal is he gets the stuff out,|gets it to me. I get it to you.
{60803}{60920}I gotta warn you, this information|is quality merchandise - high priority.
{60923}{61020}I expect to be paid premium prices.|That's it. Long and short of it.
{61077}{61181}- What's your friend's name?|- He wishes to remain anonymous.
{61184}{61233}Naturally.
{61264}{61328}And you... What do you do?
{61368}{61443}I'm a fugitive from the law|on a trumped-up charge.
{61446}{61512}Currently residing here in Mexico.
{61548}{61655}FBI says I killed a border patrolman|in Laredo, Texas.
{61703}{61757}You said, "I expect to be paid..."
{61778}{61859}- Correct. Premium prices.|- But you said "l".
{61884}{61977}- Not "we".|- "We" expect to be paid.
{62081}{62130}- Hello.|- "This is the operator."
{62133}{62212}- "I have a call for Mr Philippe."|- Speaking.
{62215}{62264}- "Go ahead."|- "Gracias, seÒora."
{62267}{62317}{Y:i}Buenas tardes, SeÒor Philippe.
{62320}{62372}SeÒor GÛmez, how is SeÒora GÛmez?
{62375}{62501}{Y:i}Mucho gusto. Guess what?|You were right. My uncle says hi.
{62520}{62558}{Y:i}Hello?
{62561}{62615}{Y:i}Hello, SeÒor Philippe? Hello?
{62618}{62667}I'm still here.
{62670}{62763}{Y:i}It was beautiful! They were|dying for the stuff! I just walked in...
{63384}{63438}"For your new place!"
{63478}{63527}{Y:i}"Hasta maÒana,
{63530}{63569}Gene."
{63722}{63758}- "Hello?"|- Hi, Mom.
{63761}{63810}- "Chris! How are you?"|- Pretty good.
{63813}{63911}- "How's the apartment? Shaping up?"|- Yeah, it's coming along.
{63914}{63973}- How are you?|- "Fine, just fine."
{63976}{64042}- How's Dad?|- "Great. I'll go get him..."
{64045}{64094}No, no. Don't bother him.
{64097}{64224}Just tell him I called and...|I'll call him later or something.
{64257}{64305}Yeah, everything... Huh?
{64308}{64395}{Y:i}Better get off. Your father's|about to break his neck. I love you.
{64398}{64472}- I love you... too.|- "I'll call you back."
{64930}{64998}Do you know the restaurant|in San Francisco?
{65020}{65097}No, but I know the restaurant|in Los Angeles.
{65234}{65314}I'd like you to get into the habit|of calling me Pedro.
{65317}{65374}- OK.|- And I'll call you...
{65396}{65439}Luis.
{65455}{65531}Luis. Very good.
{65607}{65694}There's an interesting article|in my newspaper, Luis. Any in yours?
{65697}{65742}- Several.|- Wonderful.
{65745}{65794}Maybe I should read them... now.
{66026}{66082}- First rate!|- It was a pleasure to meet you.
{66085}{66174}- Enjoy the rest of your vacation.|- You too, Pedro. "AdiÛs."
{66454}{66530}If I don't show up within 30 minutes,|something went wrong
{66533}{66582}and we'll try again next month.
{66585}{66634}Now, Luis, I must stress this.
{66637}{66686}Never come to the embassy again.
{66689}{66786}It's watched by you know who.|First time you had to. I understand that.
{66789}{66848}From now on, it can't happen.
{66886}{66946}- You know Oswald?|- Lee Harvey Oswald?
{66949}{67077}He visited the embassy here. The CIA|has a picture of him on the grounds.
{67080}{67157}- They photograph everybody. Promise.|- Cross my heart.
{67160}{67211}Good. So you understand.
{67214}{67284}When you've got something for me,|make an X
{67287}{67348}at the junction of Ju·rez and Peralta.
{67351}{67407}First Monday of the month.|We'll be in touch.
{67410}{67501}- Tuesday.|- Did I say Monday? I meant Tuesday.
{67542}{67613}Now, I need to know some things|and I have a list.
{67661}{67710}The money, Pedro.
{67713}{67777}It's all right. I've got it.
{67780}{67840}Safe and sound. I didn't forget.
{67876}{67915}So...
{68028}{68138}On what frequencies and bandwidths|are the messages broadcasted?
{68593}{68642}I don't know.
{68738}{68823}- What are the orbits of the satellites?|- Don't know.
{68870}{68970}Go ahead, look. Get it over with.
{69072}{69137}Right, Luis, please, the frequencies.
{69235}{69279}I don't know that stuff.
{69282}{69364}There's no reason to continue|pretending there's a friend.
{69367}{69436}- There is a friend.|- It serves no purpose.
{69460}{69549}You can believe whatever you want|to believe. There's a friend.
{69552}{69620}OK, this will be very tedious for me.
{69623}{69675}I'll copy the questions out in English.
{69678}{69752}- You can give them to your friend.|- Fine.
{69755}{69814}For $6,000, please sign.
{70127}{70176}- Hey, Irvey!|- Hi. How are you doing?
{70179}{70228}- All right. You?|- OK.
{70327}{70400}- Put them on the account, all right?|- OK.
{70706}{70755}They're cute, aren't they?
{70758}{70817}- You look good with her.|- Thanks.
{70841}{70917}- What's his name?|- This is Fawkes.
{70944}{70998}Named after Guy Fawkes.
{71001}{71073}- Oh, yeah.|- You heard of him?
{71100}{71139}No.
{71142}{71201}He was in 17th-century England.
{71204}{71304}He tried to blow up Parliament,|but... failed.
{71568}{71657}She'll go crazy if she sees me|preparing her food.
{71755}{71794}There you go.
{71809}{71934}Hey, Fawkes, you hungry? Huh?|What do you eat?
{71996}{72059}- You're kidding!|- You may not wanna watch this.
{72062}{72168}I have to do a little Henry Vlll.|It's painless but it's gruesome.
{72584}{72690}Get rid of her. Meet me at your place|at 2300 hours. That's 11 o'clock. OK?
{72693}{72742}- Hi!|- Hi.
{72784}{72828}OK?
{72831}{72900}Lana, this is a friend of mine.
{72913}{72997}Tradecraft.|I don't really look like this. OK?
{73179}{73265}$5,000. Two for you, two for me|and one for my expenses.
{73268}{73327}- I can't believe you did it.|- Oh, I did it.
{73330}{73389}And I didn't even give them your name,
{73392}{73455}though they tried everything|short of the rack!
{73458}{73507}You son of a bitch!
{73532}{73617}It's a sweet deal, Chris. Really "perfecto."
{73713}{73802}This girl's cute.|Where did she come from?
{73852}{73918}You know, there's a felony warrant|out on you.
{73921}{74006}I know. I wish them a lot of luck.|Check this out.
{74107}{74171}"Theodore Lovelance."
{74190}{74249}- Do you like that?|- Yes!
{74275}{74332}- Lousy picture.|- Lousy?
{74335}{74384}Oh, yeah.
{74387}{74462}They want to know some stuff,|some details.
{74465}{74574}I accidentally washed it,|but I think you can still read it.
{74804}{74853}It's for real.
{75001}{75050}Ah, Jesus!
{75187}{75236}Don't answer.
{75368}{75417}Chris!
{75604}{75673}Chris! Chris, open up! It's us!
{75676}{75753}- Oh, shit!|- Open the door, son!
{75756}{75805}Just stay there. OK?
{75808}{75857}Yeah.
{75893}{75937}- Hi.|- Hi.
{75940}{75989}We woke you?
{75992}{76068}We brought the TV for you.|Where do you want to put it?
{76071}{76137}On the desk, over to the desk.
{76140}{76204}It's not bad. It's not bad at all.
{76311}{76360}Yeah, that's great.
{76404}{76463}Hello, Mrs Boyce. Hello, sir.
{76496}{76548}Take these to your mom.
{76604}{76663}I remember that TV.
{76693}{76752}Here, I'll give you a hand.
{76846}{76895}My, you're all up early, huh?
{76898}{76965}Yeah. 11.45.
{77028}{77087}Just straightening up.
{77119}{77193}He just dropped by last night.|What was I supposed to do?
{77196}{77250}It's a tight group down there.
{77253}{77320}They like you.|They're impressed with your work.
{77323}{77417}- Don't mess it up.|- I don't hang out with him any more.
{77446}{77520}I was just as surprised to see him|as you were.
{77523}{77572}Mom, leave the dishes.
{77655}{77739}So they haven't locked you up yet,|huh, Daulton?
{77742}{77831}No. Too fast for 'em, sir.
{78036}{78112}Yeah, all the way! All the way!|Keep going! All the way!
{78115}{78171}You got nine minutes, then you're gone!
{78191}{78270}- No problem. It's on the house.|- Really? Thanks.
{78273}{78375}{Y:i}... in Australia today with the ouster|of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.
{78378}{78480}{Y:i}The action, unprecedented in its|75"- year history as a federation,"
{78483}{78537}{Y:i}was taken by the Governor General,
{78540}{78648}{Y:i}exercising an obscure but inherent|privilege to fire a prime minister.
{78651}{78715}{Y:i}The business community|applauded the action.
{78718}{78800}{Y:i}Labour unions protested it|by immediately calling strikes.
{79429}{79513}Do you know the restaurant|in San Francisco?
{80268}{80327}That's all right. I'll get it.
{81220}{81279}- What's the story?|- Change of plans. Get in.
{81282}{81331}Come on, get in.
{81927}{81976}Sit down.
{82082}{82131}Don't be afraid.
{82630}{82714}I have heard much about you,|Comrade Lee. Now we meet.
{82717}{82791}- How are you?|- Fine.
{82794}{82868}- Who are you?|- Fine, thank you.
{82896}{82945}No. "Who" are you?
{82965}{83049}A fellow comrade in the service of peace.
{83052}{83101}Karpov.
{83582}{83631}This is good for them.
{83634}{83723}Tomorrow, leave Camino Real|and check inside this hotel.
{83726}{83809}- What's he talking about?|- Camino Real's too conspicuous.
{83812}{83881}Too many people can see you.|This place is less visible.
{83884}{83948}- I never heard of it.|- This why it is good.
{83951}{84000}You'll like it.
{84022}{84081}Does it have a swimming pool?
{84497}{84556}Hey! Hey!
{84575}{84638}What about a ride?
{84645}{84734}First of all, I don't like to be|kidnapped against my will!
{84737}{84802}I went to the Obelisque in good faith.
{84805}{84914}Next thing, I'm in an automobile|with this gentleman, almost getting killed!
{84917}{85009}Secondly, that fuckin' park!|How did you expect me to get home?
{85012}{85121}I'm out on the street for 2Ω goddamn|hours waiting for a fuckin' taxi!
{85124}{85195}Excuse me. Thirdly,
{85198}{85291}nobody tells me where I can stay|and where I can't stay!
{85294}{85391}I went to that fleabag of yours!|I'll tell you something! I am insulted!
{85394}{85443}I don't care who you are!
{85446}{85497}I stay where I wanna stay!
{85540}{85664}So... tell us about this mysterious|friend of yours, Comrade Lee.
{85681}{85739}You have some money for me or what?
{85773}{85822}Karpov...
{85989}{86038}Is the Negro your friend?
{86041}{86110}- Is my friend Negro?|- Yes.
{86351}{86390}Maybe.
{86507}{86577}Do you know what this is?
{86580}{86629}Let me guess.
{86632}{86685}- Camera?|- Camera Minox-B.
{86688}{86737}Very accurate and very exact.
{86740}{86806}It's very dangerous for your friend to...
{86855}{86904}He's been making Xerox cop...
{87448}{87547}He's been making Xerox copies,|probably on a machine where he works.
{87550}{87645}The counters on those machines|are more than likely checked.
{87665}{87727}So you want us to photograph them|from now on.
{87755}{87860}- Decent idea. Give me the camera.|- No, this one's mine.
{87959}{88033}I had an idea that might be|of interest to you, OK?
{88036}{88153}I know a gentleman in Lima, Peru.|You have an embassy or something.
{88156}{88212}This guy can get his hands on heroin.
{88215}{88273}Large amounts of heroin, dirt cheap.
{88276}{88330}It's a fine product. Here's the problem.
{88333}{88424}It's difficult to get this stuff|out of South America these days.
{88427}{88566}My idea is this. I arrange a buy.|All right? Say 5 kilos to start.
{88569}{88648}Your people bring it up|in their diplomatic pouches.
{88651}{88751}I wouldn't think there'd be any risk|in that. We split it 50-50.
{88754}{88835}I get my end into the States.|You do what you want with your half.
{88838}{88902}What do you say?
{89090}{89139}Think about it.
{89170}{89290}This is the Bellas Artes. The Ballet|FolklÛrico performs here twice a week.
{89293}{89425}And, oh, the Polyforum designed by|famous Mexican muralist Siqueiros.
{89447}{89528}The Camino Real!|This is my home away from home.
{89531}{89599}It's the finest hotel in all of Mexico City.
{89602}{89677}- And you stay there?|- Every time I go down.
{89697}{89803}- Are you kidding?|- How did this get here?
{89806}{89930}I call this "Lee and Boyce -|the before picture".
{90076}{90132}What is this? The after picture?
{90240}{90371}Annie called me and I rushed home and|he's back. The insanity's going on again.
{90374}{90457}- See if he'll come over.|- Could you come over, Ken?
{90479}{90597}All right, here. Take the torch.|Just put it right by your face.
{90618}{90672}Let's get this thing set.
{90697}{90746}What's up?
{90772}{90811}Nothing.
{90814}{90863}I'll be right back.
{90866}{90940}Just get yourself a drink or something.
{90982}{91061}I've been playing the stock market|down there in Mexico.
{91064}{91113}- Have you?|- Yeah.
{91116}{91180}- Been doing very well, too.|- That's good.
{91251}{91310}Actually, if you wanna know the truth,
{91313}{91387}the stock market thing is just a cover-up.
{91425}{91543}I'm really selling government secrets|to the Soviet Union down there.
{91546}{91625}That's what the camera's for -|to photograph documents.
{91628}{91730}You really oughta come down there|with me sometime. What do you think?
{91733}{91782}I think that'd be great.
{91785}{91857}- Hi, Clay. How are you doing?|- That's for you.
{91860}{91944}- Daulton, take a picture of us.|- Daulton!
{92148}{92192}Hi, Dad.
{92195}{92244}How are you?
{92247}{92296}Well, I'm fine.
{92327}{92388}It's... good to have you home.
{92391}{92475}- Thanks. What's up?|- I just had a call from Kenny.
{92478}{92537}He's managed to reschedule|your court date.
{92540}{92589}- Terrific!|- Yeah.
{92602}{92691}Now is the time for you to realise|that your situation is serious.
{92694}{92738}The party, Brad.
{92741}{92804}The thing to do is get those people|outta here
{92807}{92922}and for you to come back to reality|with a better mental attitude.
{92925}{92974}What do you say?
{93005}{93054}I know what you're saying.
{93057}{93125}I found $900 on your dresser|this morning.
{93128}{93177}Do you think it's still there?
