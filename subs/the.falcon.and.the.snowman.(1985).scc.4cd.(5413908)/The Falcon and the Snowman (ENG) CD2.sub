{12584}{12633}They'll pay.

{14168}{14254}I taught you how to use one of these.|You'd learn real fast.
{14257}{14342}Took him three years to get the nerve|to take the fish off the hook!
{14345}{14421}I'll get it, I'll get it!
{14465}{14551}Chris, it's for you. It's Daulton.

{21973}{22027}Thanks. Thanks, Eddie.
{22137}{22189}- Well?|- It's a dead project.
{22212}{22323}It's abandoned. It didn't even|reach the blueprint stage.
{22344}{22393}It's worthless garbage. It's bait.
{22396}{22449}You didn't bring it in, I didn't.
{22452}{22554}None of us saw anybody bring it in.|It didn't get in here by itself.
{22577}{22640}Those bastards don't trust us.
{22774}{22823}OK.
{22848}{22927}OK, fine. Somebody wanna play games?
{22984}{23084}- That's fine with me!|- Come on, Gene.
{23241}{23310}Darling, what on earth...?
{23313}{23397}I'm building us a house. It's in Costa Rica.
{23410}{23483}It's not started yet.|It's in the architectural stage.
{23486}{23547}- But I bought the property.|- Costa Rica?
{23550}{23624}The most beautiful stretch of beach|you've ever seen!
{23627}{23711}4200 square feet, split-level,|5 bedrooms,
{23714}{23828}4 baths, sauna, Jacuzzi, aviary|and an elevator down to the beach!
{23847}{23910}What's anyone gonna do in Costa Rica?
{23947}{24086}Fish, take long strolls on the beach,|collect shells, relax.
{24089}{24160}Take it easy for once in your lives.|You deserve it.
{24186}{24253}- They do that here.|- David.
{24367}{24421}- Yeah?|- "Daulton, this is Clay."
{24455}{24538}Let me get on the other phone, OK?|David, can you hang this up?
{24747}{24796}- "Hello there."|- "I got a buyer."
{24799}{24878}- "Five ounces - 8"5"00."|- "Wait a minute, Clay. Five ounces?"
{24881}{24972}- "That's what you said. All set."|- "Four ounces, I said, not five."
{24975}{25111}{Y:i}You go back to the bargaining table.|You tell them it's their mistake...
{25273}{25347}Something else about this house.|It's solar heated.
{25350}{25439}When in God's name is it gonna stop?
{25442}{25471}What?
{25474}{25544}I will not have dope deals|made in this house!
{25547}{25601}- What dope deals?|- When is it gonna stop?
{25604}{25658}I'm not dealing dope any more.|I'm out of it.
{25661}{25757}You jumped bail, you disappeared!|Probation people call us!
{25760}{25816}- The cops watch our house!|- They do not!
{25819}{25911}- You missed Christmas by a week!|- Wanna know what I was doing?
{25914}{25998}- You're not here an hour...|- Want to know what I was doing?
{26001}{26057}- I was doing top secret!|- Brad, please!
{26060}{26151}- I'm sick and tired...|- Working for the government, CIA!
{26154}{26212}I was working for the CIA!
{26215}{26264}Me!
{26374}{26447}I don't know what I'm doin' any more.|I'm trying!
{26450}{26534}- Don't worry. They'll get over it.|- You've gotta make up for me.
{26537}{26604}You've gotta make them happy,|make them proud!
{26627}{26676}Do you want me to drive?
{26679}{26781}- No drugs. That's the main thing.|- You just ran a stop sign.
{26784}{26838}Don't break their hearts the way I have.
{26841}{26908}You do and I find out, I'll kill you, I swear!
{26911}{26970}Promise me.
{26973}{27022}I promise.
{27025}{27074}Do you love me?
{27096}{27126}Oh, shit!
{27129}{27193}Oh! I gotta lose these guys!
{27743}{27806}Get out, David! It's my problem. Run!
{28225}{28269}OK! Yeah!
{28453}{28512}Did he call yet?
{28515}{28564}Well, when he does,
{28567}{28616}tell him it's over.
{28619}{28676}I want out. It's gotta stop.
{28769}{28862}I've been thinking, too.|I think it's time we diversify.
{28865}{28956}- Get a few subcontractors...|- What did I just say?
{28959}{29028}I heard you. I agree with you.|I think we "should" retire.
{29031}{29131}Get somebody else to do the roadwork.|Pull the strings. Ike could be interested.
{29134}{29237}- Clay. Think Perry could handle it?|- What about your little brother?
{29240}{29357}- David?|- You'd do that to him! Drag him into it!
{29376}{29465}- This is a business! We gotta expand!|- You're sick!
{29468}{29563}It's been nickels and dimes|compared to the possibilities!
{29566}{29638}- Where are you going?|- It's over, delivery boy!
{29676}{29765}- Hey, wait a minute...|- Get outta the way! Outta the way!
{29768}{29833}- Get outta the way!|- I Xeroxed everything!
{29836}{29941}Every cipher, every document!|Yeah! Make you nervous?
{29944}{30078}Don't worry. I'm not gonna do anything|with them as long as you're reasonable.
{30081}{30182}You don't believe me? Go! Go ahead!|That's the quickest way to find out!
{30185}{30282}- Where are they?|- In a safe place. In a safe place.
{30285}{30330}You're lying.
{30333}{30399}How about I give 'em to your father?|How would that be?
{30402}{30465}Give 'em to the great FBI man!|How would he feel?
{30468}{30531}A Soviet spy for a son!
{30534}{30634}This is my livelihood now!|You can't just take this away from me!
{30656}{30705}Yes?
{30777}{30846}- "Do you have the merchandise?"|- Yes, I do.
{30849}{30898}{Y:i}Is it better quality this time?
{30901}{31019}- My associate assures me it is.|- "Is he there with you?"
{31068}{31117}No.
{31145}{31244}- You still there, Alex?|- "You'll be delivering it, then?"
{31247}{31296}That is correct.
{31352}{31406}- The first Tuesday.|- "Monday."
{31409}{31458}Monday.
{32023}{32117}I know it's a lot to ask -|to work in silence for once!
{32196}{32250}Fuck! Fuck it!
{32398}{32447}Let's go out.
{32529}{32598}- What's wrong?|- You tell me!
{32966}{33015}What's happening?
{33086}{33135}Tell me. Please tell me.
{33214}{33263}Come here.
{33643}{33692}I...
{34868}{34942}It's just the maid. Later, señora!
{35002}{35051}Tell her to come back later.
{35516}{35576}Hello.
{35579}{35629}Well, hello there.
{35679}{35728}Hello there. Come in.
{35777}{35826}Are you well?
{35829}{35938}I took a few days off.|Called in sick. Need a vacation.
{35941}{35990}Well, great! Great!
{36006}{36050}Uh, Raul,
{36053}{36137}my best friend from California - Chris.|Chris, Raul.
{36140}{36189}- Raul.|- Hi.
{36218}{36267}- We're finished, yes?|- Yes.
{36270}{36329}OK. I'll be right back, all right?
{37175}{37239}- Trouble?|- No.
{37697}{37786}Look, just relax. I'm not trying|to cut you out of the picture.
{37789}{37838}Really?
{38000}{38084}Secret little messages|behind my back. Yeah!
{38124}{38173}Nice try, Judas.
{38186}{38267}- Well, you put me in that position.|- Christopher.
{38372}{38431}Or should I call you Falcon?
{38468}{38527}- My name...|- Alex.
{38558}{38632}- This your first time in Mexico?|- Mexico City.
{38661}{38736}Daulton is showing you|the more inspiring landmarks?
{38739}{38788}Yes.
{38831}{38921}You make a good tour guide, Daulton.|I always knew it.
{38990}{39060}You know, you're not what I expected.
{39083}{39137}And you're not black.
{39156}{39208}- Pardon me?|- It's a long story.
{39211}{39275}- Where are we going?|- To dinner.
{39278}{39357}They'll ask about the frequencies,|so don't trip me up.
{39360}{39424}I told him he'd get them next month.
{39503}{39548}The operation goes fine.
{39551}{39652}Unfortunately, one serious problem|remains. Do you know what it is?
{39655}{39709}- The frequencies.|- "Exactamente."
{39712}{39791}For anything to be worth anything,|we must, as you know,
{39794}{39878}have the daily transmitting frequencies.
{39881}{39970}Well, that's not entirely true, as "you" know.
{39973}{40052}The fact is I can't get them.|I don't have access to them.
{40071}{40130}He assured me that he could get them.
{40133}{40182}- No, I didn't.|- Yes, you did!
{40185}{40244}They're not even kept at RTX.
{40257}{40347}Only Western Union and the NSA|have the daily list.
{40350}{40428}Now, I never said I could get them|and I can't.
{40642}{40701}You know these people, I assume.
{40780}{40840}- Most of them.|- Good.
{40843}{40959}What I would like is that you write|a little something about each one.
{40962}{41026}Their exact job titles to begin with.
{41055}{41104}- Where are you going?|- Can I talk to you?
{41107}{41166}Sit down and shut up!
{41169}{41230}Also physical descriptions of each.
{41233}{41333}Height, weight and so on.|Their home addresses if you know them.
{41336}{41419}And maybe some details|about their families.
{41422}{41480}Drinking habits, religious habits.
{41483}{41557}Sexual deviations and so on.
{41766}{41861}None of those people will help you|the way I've helped you.
{42073}{42159}- Are you trying to get me killed?|- You shouldn't have promised.
{42162}{42233}You should've lied!|They're not gonna stand for this!
{42236}{42358}Give these people what they want!|They're watching us through this!
{42361}{42450}There's wires all over this place!|It's all bugged!
{42755}{42839}I'm sick of this fucking hocus-pocus shit!
{42964}{43053}$10,000 right now or we're gone!
{43075}{43143}"Basura." Just like everything else.
{43146}{43245}Yeah? How would you know?|I'm sick of talking to a goddamn clerk!
{43248}{43314}Get me an expert!|Get me somebody who knows!
{43317}{43367}- You go back on every promise!|- "I" go back?
{43370}{43444}- Where's the infrared data?|- Where's the heroin?
{43447}{43513}- Where are the frequencies?|- Fuck the frequencies!
{43516}{43593}- Sit down and shut up!|- "You" sit down and shut up!
{43608}{43645}Karpov!
{43648}{43781}Call the great Karpov - every time|you can't handle something! Call him!
{43784}{43863}Where's the bathroom|in this fucking joint?
{44078}{44140}I am so curious about something,|I have to ask.
{44190}{44315}How is it that you and Daulton...|I mean, where do you know him from?
{44318}{44377}We were altar boys together.
{44581}{44671}Daulton doesn't know it yet,|but I'm quitting RTX.
{44674}{44788}I've already given notice.|I felt it only fair to tell you in person.
{44791}{44854}- That's why I'm down here.|- What will you do?
{44857}{44934}Going back to school.
{45003}{45084}Well, he's... pretty sick.|I'd better get him home.
{45087}{45211}No, no, don't go yet. He'll survive.|He always does. Sit down. Please.
{45336}{45410}Leaving RTX and going to college
{45446}{45506}is a very good idea.
{45509}{45588}You should consider|majoring in Russian Studies.
{45591}{45643}History, language, politics,
{45646}{45730}and then... think very seriously
{45733}{45812}about applying for a job|in the State Department or the CIA.
{45815}{45874}Absolutely not!
{45877}{45930}You know, Christopher,
{45933}{45982}we're not unalike, you and I.
{46020}{46111}I, too, have had my doubts.|I know what it does to a person.
{46114}{46163}I know what you're feeling.
{46166}{46246}What are you talking about?|I'm not a professional like you.
{46249}{46319}This isn't a career for me.|It was impulsive.
{46322}{46390}I never expected it to go on|as long as it has.
{46461}{46535}I'm not like you.|You have no idea what I'm feeling.
{46538}{46622}You want a mole in the CIA,|you find somebody else.
{46625}{46714}I have a life apart from all this, unlike you.
{46795}{46869}You know, we waited|a very long time to meet you.
{46872}{46974}We have put up with more than|anyone should ever have to!
{46977}{47026}- You owe us.|- Owe you?
{47047}{47096}Owe you?
{47099}{47191}Christopher, you remember one thing.
{47219}{47268}Impulsively or not,
{47271}{47339}you came to us. We didn't come to you.
{47363}{47432}And, whether you realise it or not,
{47455}{47504}you are a professional.
{47631}{47720}The moment you accepted money,|you became a professional.
{47752}{47830}You can't leave here tonight|free of it all any more than I can.
{47833}{47892}Did you really think you could?
{47952}{48011}It's not over, Christopher.
{48141}{48195}It's just beginning.
{48353}{48432}I cross the border a million times|and I don't get caught!
{48435}{48502}Get busted on a felony|and they let me go!
{48536}{48629}Everything you give me looks good,|but it isn't. It is "basura!"
{48632}{48731}It is garbage!|I'm not stupid, Chris. I read books.
{48734}{48814}- What are you talking about?|- It's called disinformation.
{48817}{48866}- Counterespionage.|- What?
{48869}{48933}You're backed by the Company.|You're one of them!
{48963}{49045}The CIA's got a picture of Oswald|and they've got one of me, too!
{49048}{49147}That's all part of the plan,|so it's OK! It's OK!
{49181}{49240}So what happens next?
{49260}{49361}- You throw me to the wolves?|- Look what that shit's doing to you!
{49364}{49444}- It's all that's keeping me sane!|- It's killing you!
{49447}{49545}I don't know who my friends are!|I don't know who to trust!
{49548}{49633}I don't know who to trust!|Don't throw me to the wolves!
{49636}{49698}Listen! Leave your bags behind!
{49701}{49763}We'll get on the plane and get outta here.
{49805}{49854}We'll go home.
{49857}{49906}Huh?
{49947}{49996}Come on, come on.
{50047}{50096}I'm OK.
{50173}{50222}I'm OK.
{50698}{50777}Chris? Chris!
{50847}{50904}- What's going on?|- I think I got everything.
{50907}{50994}You'd better double-check|just to make sure.
{51029}{51126}- What are you doing?|- I don't love you any more.
{51129}{51189}I want your things outta here tonight.
{51192}{51241}Chris.
{52417}{52471}It's been fun.
{53327}{53376}It's about time!
{53777}{53863}You gotta promise to come and see me|the day after you graduate.
{53866}{53919}I want to make you the first offer.
{53922}{53998}No offence, Larry,|but the pay's not too hot!
{54018}{54078}Come and see "us." We'll take care of you.
{54081}{54164}The Agency can't afford|to let a guy like you get away.
{54244}{54296}Chris! Hold still!
{55058}{55143}It's about time!|I've been stuck for the last time, Alex.
{55146}{55195}From now on, I set up the deals!
{55198}{55301}What's this? What's this?|Oh, wanna play "this" game, huh? Huh?
{55395}{55464}- Alex, tell this guy to let go!|- Shut up.
{55585}{55639}Tell him to let go of my arm!
{55740}{55770}Oh! Fuck!
{55833}{55863}{Y:i}Basura.
{56589}{56694}I don't need this shit. There's|a lot easier ways of making a living.
{56800}{56869}I wanna make one last delivery.
{56985}{57084}What do you think? Do you think|I'm making this up as I go along?
{57087}{57136}I'm not going down there any more.
{57139}{57196}I'm not asking you to. I'm gonna do it.
{57199}{57227}What?
{57245}{57347}They were just waiting the whole time.|Stringing you along to get to me.
{57350}{57432}They don't need you or want you|any more. They want me.
{57608}{57700}I'm through with running.|I mean, the thrill is gone.
{57703}{57794}I'm gonna go to court,|face the music, do time, whatever.
{57797}{57940}I'll just get a new start.|I'm sick of this shit. I'm tired of it.
{57969}{58080}I'm tired, too.|So tired I can hardly stand it.
{58083}{58178}I'm gonna be looking over my shoulder|the rest of my life.
{58181}{58295}And for what? There's never|gonna be any reconciliation.
{58298}{58382}They're just as paranoid|and dangerous as we are.
{58432}{58531}I can't imagine why I thought|they'd be any different.
{58534}{58588}Well, fuck them!
{58616}{58700}I'm gonna get something|out of this nightmare.
{58703}{58762}They're gonna want this
{58765}{58828}and they are gonna pay!
{58831}{58890}- The frequencies?|- Satellite.
{58916}{58965}Pyramider.
{58988}{59053}- How much are you gonna ask for it?|- 100,000.
{59466}{59515}It's too dangerous.
{59578}{59638}I'm not gonna let you go down there.
{61117}{61166}Alex!
{61207}{61259}Alex! Hey!
{62794}{62856}Tell these guys to put their guns away!
{62886}{62947}Don't point that gun at me! Hey, come on!
{63037}{63111}- I'm an American tourist!|- Tell me what's happening.
{63114}{63182}- Oh! I'm American!|- Yes. Calm down. Slowly...
{63185}{63287}- I'm coming down the street, OK?|- I'm with the American Embassy.
{63290}{63357}- You happened to be coming by?|- Yes.
{63442}{63508}I got separated from my girlfriend.
{63511}{63578}- She's gone in this museum...|- It's not a museum.
{63581}{63659}Leave this to me. Let me deal with|the officials. Calm down.
{63724}{63760}Take your gun out of my ribs!
{63812}{63958}Are you the head guy? There's $500.|It's yours. Forget the whole thing!
{64140}{64261}An American's been arrested.|Get over to police HQ. I'll meet you there.
{64542}{64622}Like to know what I'm charged with,|if you don't mind.
{64846}{64891}Christ!
{64920}{65015}I appreciate you coming down.|It's just a stupid mistake...
{65018}{65143}- This is Walt Hamilton, Vice Consul.|- Don't worry. We'll get you out of here.
{65540}{65576}Occupation?
{65579}{65648}Photographer.|I work for an advertising agency.
{65651}{65700}That's a communications satellite.
{65703}{65795}My firm's doing promotional films|for General Electric
{65798}{65855}to interest... investors.
{65858}{65922}- "Documentos."|- Olympics, World Series.
{65925}{65974}That sort of thing.
{66031}{66104}- It's a postcard.|- Bellas Artes.
{66107}{66156}You carry it as a trophy?
{66174}{66242}- You like to look at it?|- It's a postcard.
{66266}{66315}Look, this is foolish.
{66318}{66410}If they're not gonna charge me,|I'd like to get outta here.
{66621}{66720}- What's he saying?|- They're charging you with murder.
{66723}{66770}You're kidding.
{66773}{66822}You've gotta be kidding!
{66825}{66886}- Cop killer.|- I am not!
{66889}{66937}- "Comunista."|- I am not!
{66940}{67019}- "Terrorista!"|- No, I am a tourist.
{67022}{67102}I am a businessman. I am a Republican.
{67124}{67188}I have my rights! I am an American!
{67191}{67240}This is not America.
{67542}{67596}{Y:i}Hotel Camino Real. Buenas tardes.
{67599}{67715}{Y:i}I have a person-to-person call|from the US for a Mr Theodore Lovelance.
{67718}{67887}{Y:i}Mr Lovelance? Yes, he is in Room 122.|I'll ring. Please hold the line.
{67911}{67969}- "Hello?"|- "Mr Lovelance?"
{67983}{68072}- "Who's calling, please?"|- "Is Mr Lovelance there?"
{68101}{68200}{Y:i}No, he isn't, operator.|Who's placing this call, please?
{68220}{68307}{Y:i}Sir? Would you like to leave a message?
{68310}{68364}{Y:i}Mr Lovelance doesn't seem to be in.
{68367}{68449}{Y:i}Would you like to leave a message|or try back later?
{68489}{68597}I'm sorry, sir. That London flight|is booked. Try stand-by or I can book...
{68600}{68694}No. Try Buenos Aires at 4 o'clock.
{68697}{68770}- Buenos Aires?|- Right.
{68773}{68834}Checking, sir.
{68919}{68996}"Final boarding call for Pan Am flight" 55"1"
{68999}{69067}{Y:i}to Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires.
{69070}{69174}{Y:i}"Pan Am flight" 55"1 to Rio de Janeiro"|and Buenos Aires
{69177}{69226}{Y:i}now boarding.
{69710}{69774}Who gave you the assignment|to kill the policeman?
{69777}{69821}I didn't kill anybody.
{69824}{69898}- Who do you work for?|- The United States government.
{69965}{69995}Fuck off!
{69998}{70077}- Who do you work for?|- The CIA.
{70359}{70449}- I can't read this. I don't speak Spanish.|- Your confession.
{70569}{70618}Sign it.
{70815}{70877}I'm not a communist!
{71017}{71109}I'm telling you the truth!|You got the wrong guy! Stop!
{71312}{71381}I'm not an assassin! I'm just a spy!
{71600}{71712}{Y:i}You fuck with us,|you accept the consequences!
{71715}{71786}{Y:i}College boys running things!
{72047}{72074}Uh-uh.
{72193}{72217}Never!
{72825}{72876}Listening! Listening!
{72905}{72954}Where are the wires?
{73724}{73773}We're deporting you.
{73776}{73835}You have your choice of destination.
{73887}{73994}- Costa Rica.|- The Soviet Union or the United States?
{74119}{74162}America.
{74726}{74768}Lana.
{74771}{74850}The FBI's gonna come around|asking questions.
{74867}{74979}There'll be all kinds of stories being told.|They'll try to implicate you.
{75009}{75108}There'll be stories, lies.|You won't know who to believe.
{75111}{75235}And that's the look that'll tell 'em|you had nothing to do with it.
{75238}{75287}With what?
{75385}{75461}I love you... and I always did.
{75636}{75685}{Y:i}Adiós, amigo.
{77289}{77353}Now, you get out. You just go.
{77421}{77470}You're free.
{79556}{79645}- Up, shit-heels! Get up!|- Lose the bag!
{79648}{79731}- Lose the bag!|- Put your hands up!
{79734}{79813}Put your hands up|or I'll blow your head off!
{79946}{80005}You fuckin' traitor!
{80180}{80241}All right, let's get him outta here.
{80296}{80408}July 29th 1974, you signed a security|agreement that you would not transmit
{80411}{80505}classified information|to any unauthorised person or agency.
{80508}{80542}Correct.
{80545}{80595}You were told that such a violation
{80598}{80671}could be punishable|under Federal Criminal Statutes.
{80674}{80713}Correct.
{80716}{80786}Have you, in fact,|violated that agreement?
{80789}{80828}You bet.
{80831}{80904}Did you remove NSA ciphers|from the communications room?
{80907}{81006}Ciphers, Pilot TWXs,|Argus, Rhyolite data,
{81009}{81098}ground resolution studies,|performance sheets.
{81101}{81174}Pyramider - useless and obsolete.
{81177}{81291}Whatever happened|to be lying around that day.
{81397}{81446}- Keystone Kops.|- What?
{81532}{81606}Security at RTX. Keystone Kops.
{81609}{81683}How long have you been|an agent for the KGB?
{81729}{81814}I've never been an agent for the KGB.|I work for no one but myself.
{81817}{81914}I'm in no political organisations|other than the Democratic Party.
{81917}{81966}How much money did you receive?
{81969}{82018}Personally, or...?
{82021}{82144}About $20,000. Money's never been|real important to me.
{82180}{82272}You referred to CIA activities|unrelated to the satellites.
{82275}{82334}Could you be more specific?
{82360}{82444}I haven't mentioned a word|about the CIA,
{82468}{82524}but I could be very specific.
{82527}{82587}What was your control agent's name?
{82613}{82662}What? I'm sorry. What?
{82665}{82719}We can continue later if you're too tired.
{82722}{82796}No, I'm fine.|I just didn't hear your question.
{82799}{82874}Who did you receive|your instructions from?
{82927}{82971}My conscience.
{83001}{83077}I know a few things|about predatory behaviour.
{83153}{83235}What was once a legitimate|intelligence-gathering agency
{83238}{83335}is now being misused|to prey on weaker governments.
{83476}{83507}We ran out.
{83546}{83600}I appreciate fear.
{83603}{83652}The chance to face it.
{83655}{83754}There's nothing more exhilarating|than confronting your fears.
{83757}{83801}What are you afraid of?
{83804}{83908}Of people who can imagine and create|sophisticated weaponry
{83932}{84009}and a government|that can't be trusted with it.
{84066}{84200}We're the only nation that ever used|atomic weapons on other human beings.
{84302}{84351}We "are" capable of it.
{84366}{84437}By turning over US secrets|to the Soviet Union
{84440}{84539}you're putting every man, woman|and child here in jeopardy.
{84542}{84605}They're already in jeopardy.
{84623}{84677}There are other forms of protest.
{84690}{84769}Are you sorry you didn't choose|one of them?
{84833}{84877}Chris.
{84919}{84949}Chris.
{84952}{85001}What?
{85004}{85063}You don't feel you hurt anybody?
{85198}{85247}The government's worried, Charlie.
{85250}{85322}This case could cause|serious political damage.
{85325}{85373}There's debate now
{85376}{85489}whether prosecution is worth|the disclosures that might arise in a trial.
{85552}{85652}So Chris holds the kind of cards|that could save himself.
{85655}{85749}- Daddy...|- Eric! Eric, I'll fix that for you.
{85916}{86013}Charlie, all of us realise that this situation
{86016}{86090}could just as easily have happened to us,
{86093}{86142}with one of our boys.
{86145}{86231}And we all want you to know|that, with your OK,
{86253}{86378}we'll do whatever we can to see that|this case never reaches a courtroom.
{86459}{86548}Two of my boys came home today|from school bloody.
{86589}{86694}Teacher just stood around|and watched some kids beat 'em up.
{86697}{86761}Do you know what they called them?
{86764}{86833}Do you know what they called my sons?
{86860}{86909}Communists.
{86934}{87057}Charlie, do you understand|what I'm trying to tell you?
{87118}{87167}I don't think anybody
{87170}{87279}should do anything|to influence this case in any way.
{87515}{87569}Let him be judged.
{88092}{88186}Christopher! Christopher!|What do you think of your sentence?
{88189}{88305}- Do you plan to appeal?|- Do you think you got a fair trial?
{88376}{88419}Stand back!
{88422}{88472}Do you feel any remorse?
{88505}{88557}You guys still talk to each other?
