3
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:48,335
- Is that for us?
- No, it's for you.

4
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,337
- What is that?
- A mantrap.

5
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,382
They used to use it
for catching poachers.

6
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,134
Hello, Amy.

7
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,678
- Hello, Charlie.
- Where do we put it, Mr. Sumner?

8
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,806
- Oh. Here in the back.
- Oh, it's heavy, Mr. Sumner.

9
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,809
I'm surprised
you still remember me.

10
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,811
Where do we put it, Amy?

11
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,814
Anywhere you want.
It's your birthday present.

12
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,442
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

13
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,986
- Don't scratch it.
- Why are you surprised?

14
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,156
- How long has it been, Charlie?
- Three summer holidays in six years.

15
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,202
David, this is an old
friend of mine, Charlie Venner.

16
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,204
My husband, David Sumner.

17
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,206
- Mr. Venner.
- Please call me Charlie.

18
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,542
You work around here?

19
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,377
Sometimes.

20
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,921
- Will you give me a hand, please?
- Yeah.

21
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,424
- David's a mathematician.
- What are you going to catch?

22
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,135
- Peace and quiet.
- Oh, an arithmetic teacher.

23
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,678
- Well, uh-
- No.

24
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,680
He's writing a book...

25
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:44,475
on the computer analysis
of the celestial-

26
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,352
Good try. Here, why don't you
put this in the trunk, Amy.

27
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,354
Let me.

28
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,155
Maybe, um, Charlie could
help us with the garage, David.

29
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,866
Yeah, that's a good idea.
This fellow Norman, uh-

30
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,160
- Scutt.
- Yes.

31
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:07,831
- He's, uh, taking forever.
- Me and Bobby'll do it
for you, Mr. Sumner.

32
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,251
Me and my cousin Bertie will be out
tomorrow. We'll get it up for you.

33
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,253
Yes? How much?

34
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,840
- Oh, reasonable.
- Okay, thank you.

35
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,218
- We're at-
- Back at Trencher's farm.

36
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,220
We'll be there, sir.

37
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,389
Good. Good.

38
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,606
Where are you going?

39
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,316
David?

40
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,069
- Where are you going?
- Cigarettes.

41
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,365
Okay.

42
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:48,497
Uh, a couple of packs of
any American cigarettes, please.

43
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,999
- Time, gentlemen, please.

44
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,585
Finish your drinkin', gentlemen.
Let me have your glasses.

45
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,894
Henry Niles.

46
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,439
I thought he was to be put away.

47
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:17,192
Oh, we can take care
of our own here. Usually do.

48
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,785
Remember when
I took care of you, Amy?

49
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,503
But you didn't.
Remember?

50
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,050
There was once a time,
Mrs. Sumner...

51
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:45,596
when you were ready
to beg me for it.

52
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,639
Take your hands off me.

53
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,706
Come on, gentlemen. Drink up.
Let me have your glasses, please.

54
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,792
Bloody early, Harry.

55
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,049
Harry...

56
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,053
I think I should have another pint.

57
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,188
Sorry about my uncle, Harry.

58
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,190
I think he's a bit taken with drink.

59
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,234
Oh.

60
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,529
I do beg your pardon,
Mr. Harry Ware.

61
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:47,825
- I'll pay for
the American gentlemen's cigarettes.
- Oh, no, that's okay, l-

62
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,577
That's all right.
I got it, sir.

63
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,579
Garage coming along?

64
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,581
Norman fixing it up all right?

65
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,458
Yeah.

66
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,547
And I'll pay for the glass.

67
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:05,300
And I'll even pay for the little bit of
plaster to put on your bleedin' finger.

68
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:09,680
But I do think I should have
another pint to take me home.

69
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,141
The bar's closed, Tom.

70
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,184
- Come on, Tom.
- Oh.

71
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,854
It is, is it?

72
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,273
We'll see about that.!

73
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,776
- Take it easy, old man!
- Old man, you say?

74
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,799
All right, Tom.

75
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,676
You've had your fun.

76
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,678
Pay the man and leave.

77
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,848
Ah.

78
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,937
Oh.

79
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,232
I do beg your pardon,
Mr. Magistrate.

80
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,239
But what I am, I am.

81
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,283
What's the damage, Harry?

82
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,951
Call it a quid, Tom.

83
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,496
Let's call it, uh...

84
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,498
30 bob.

85
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,211
Will that do then, eh, Major?

86
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,213
Go home, Tom, will you...

87
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,840
or you'll be up before me
on a fresh charge.

88
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:36,308
Come on, lads.
Work to be done.

89
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,354
- See you tonight, Harry.
- All right, Tom.

90
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,363
I showed him, eh, lads?

91
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,078
Uh, they're paid for, sir.

92
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,833
They are now.

93
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:27,359
- Stupid cow!
- Get off!

94
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,195
What was that about?

95
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,078
Who was that big guy
with the beard?

96
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:40,706
Why?

97
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,751
Is he any relation
to your friend Charlie?

98
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,753
Yes.

99
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:06,899
How well do you know
this fellow Venner?

100
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,235
Stop teasing.

101
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,696
- Did you ever go out with him?
- Stop.

102
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,199
- Hmm?
- Leave me alone! Stop it!

103
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,701
- Stop.

104
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,703
- Tell me.
- I'll stop the car.

105
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:21,997
I just want to know.
Tell me.

106
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,833
Stop. I'm telling you.

107
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,461
- You asked for it.
- Okay.

108
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,505
All right, drive the car- Ooh!

109
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,423
- Ooh! Ooh!

110
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,383
You asked for it!
Chicken!

111
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,303
- You're nuts!
- You're terrible! You're wicked!

112
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:40,140
- Oh, by the way-

113
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,810
- Yeah?
- Venner did try to get fresh once.

114
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,395
Yeah? So?

115
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:49,024
Nothing happened.!
- Ba-bum

116
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:52,528
Ba-ba-bah-bum
Ba-ba, ba-bum

117
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,265
Hi.

118
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,561
You'll have some help tomorrow.

119
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:30,858
Charles Venner and his cousin
are coming to help finish the garage.

120
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,527
We'll have the garage finished
before Chris gets the rats out.

121
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,488
- Hello, miss.
- Chris?

122
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,282
Yeah, Chris.

123
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:43,287
Oh, yes. Mr. Cawsey.
The rat man.

124
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,330
- Want help with this, sir?
- Yes.

125
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:49,084
It's a real antique, sir.

126
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,504
- Rare, they are.
- My wife is a collector.

127
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:54,506
But I end up with them.

128
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,509
I find it's a bit large
for my prey, sir.

129
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,595
- Won't do at all.
- Don't count on it.

130
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,847
- Do you like it here, sir?
- Very much.

131
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,850
- I hear it's pretty rough
in the States, sir.

132
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,852
Have you seen some of it, sir?

133
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,730
Bombin', riotin', snipin',
shootin' the blacks?

134
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,732
Can't walk down the streets, they say.

135
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:14,777
Was you involved in it, sir?
I mean, did you take part?

136
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,528
See anybody get knifed?

137
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,072
Just between commercials.

138
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,743
Wanna put that down there?

139
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,248
No, I'm just glad I'm here
where it's, uh, quiet...

140
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:33,504
and you can breathe fresh air
and drink water that doesn't
have to come out of a bottle.

141
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,757
It isn't water that I drink
out of a bottle, sir.

142
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,806
Those two fellows will be up
to help you tomorrow.

143
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,362
- You gonna have a crack at her, Norman?
- No.

144
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,781
Ten months inside
is enough for me.

145
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,326
- They got anything worth taking?
- Nope.

146
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,497
Except, uh...

147
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,999
these.

148
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,001
- You bloody fool.
- It was nothing.

149
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:15,337
She's got a dozen or more.

150
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,340
Full of perfume.

151
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,177
You like my trophy?

152
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,179
Bugger your trophy.

153
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,682
I want what was in 'em.

154
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,188
I could do with
some of that too, Normie.

155
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,859
Charlie Venner.

156
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:39,361
He had some of it years ago...

157
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,447
when she was here with her father.

158
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,449
Venner's a bloody liar...

159
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,492
and so are you.

160
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:52,291
Tell her, smell her
Lock her in the cellar

161
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,376
Kitty, kitty.
Where are you?

162
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:57,629
Kitty.

163
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,718
Kitty, kitty.

164
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,014
Kitty, kitty.

165
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,641
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

166
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:12,311
Want a drink?

167
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,396
I can't find the cat.

168
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,440
Doesn't answer my call.

169
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:20,110
Do I?

170
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,154
You'd better.

171
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,333
Why did you hire
Charlie Venner?

172
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,587
I didn't. You did.

173
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,589
Kitty.

174
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,092
If she's in my study,
I'll kill her.

175
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,557
What?

176
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,602
Nothing.

177
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,958
That your daddy's chair?

178
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:21,588
Every chair is my daddy's chair.

179
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,397
I'm glad we came.

180
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,405
- What are you doing?
- Kiss me.

181
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,740
Mmm.

182
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:53,245
- You're an animal.
- Mm-mmm.

183
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,671
Why'd you take my heater
out of the study?

184
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:07,342
Because it's going upstairs.

185
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,386
What happened?

186
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:15,642
It's not going upstairs.

187
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,519
It's freezing in there.

188
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,155
Hello.

189
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,699
I can see you're working at top speed.

190
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,619
Is he in there studying?

191
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,165
- You'd better do something.

192
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,210
- My husband will think
all Englishmen are lazy.
- Let me help.

193
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,962
Hey!

194
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:59,019
Yeah, come on over here. This way.

195
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,106
Watch your fingers, Chris.

196
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,659
What was so funny with them?

197
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,831
They just think
you're strange.

198
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,793
Why, because I'm American?

199
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,755
Mmm, no. No.

200
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,966
Just strange.

201
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:34,555
Do you think I'm strange?

202
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,183
Occasionally.

203
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:43,355
You act like you're 14.

204
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:47,609
I am.

205
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,654
Wanna try for 12?

206
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:56,118
How about eight?
I freak out for eight-year-olds.

207
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:10,716
- David?
- Huh?

208
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:13,218
Will you please
get some lettuce?

209
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,722
Okay.

210
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,351
Oh, and fix
the damned toaster.

211
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:34,573
What does she think
I'm doing here, playing games?

212
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,575
What is this,
grammar school?

213
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,619
Jesus Christ.

214
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,425
Uh, we're leavin' now,
Mr. Sumner.

215
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:56,428
- Mr. Riddaway be givin' us a lift.
- Fine.

216
00:18:57,805 --> 00:19:00,224
Oh, I was just sayin'
to your missus...

217
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,103
that in a funny sort of way I feel
closer to rats than I do to people.

218
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:07,648
Even though I kill 'em for a living.
Their dying is my living.

219
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:14,404
Smell a rat, see a rat, kill a rat.
That's me, Chris Cawsey.

220
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:17,908
I'd be lost without 'em.
It's true. I tell you straight.

221
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,953
Cleverest thing you ever see
around these parts is a rat.

222
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,455
Rats is life!

223
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,722
Shove up,
you overgrown bastard.

224
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:44,226
How's your day been?
Been up in a fat sheep, have ya?

225
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:49,314
Oh, you fluffy fleecy darlings

226
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,316
You with the dark brown eyes

227
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,819
David?

228
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:56,447
David.!

229
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:58,657
Dinner's ready.!

230
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,785
Did you hear me?

231
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:13,005
- Hello, Major.
- Evening, Major.

232
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:16,383
- Evening.
- Will you be having a pint
with me then, Major?

233
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,385
Not tonight.
I'll buy my own.

234
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:21,805
Otherwise
we'd never get out of here.

235
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,807
You know that.

236
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,476
Yes, I do know that.

237
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:28,812
Thanks, Harry.

238
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:31,190
Excellent.

239
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,444
- John.
- Evening, sir.

240
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:38,697
- Fancy a game?
- Aye.

241
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:40,699
- Evening, Harry.
- Evening.

242
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,537
John Niles, come here to me.

243
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:49,583
- Is this for a drink, Tom?
- No, this is for the truth.

244
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,836
Your brother.

245
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,838
Been hangin' around
the girls again.

246
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:58,592
You'd better keep a closer watch,
or we'll be puttin' him away.

247
00:21:00,094 --> 00:21:02,304
It's all right, Pa.

248
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,681
He's only throwing the ball
to 'em a little.

249
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,683
A little's too much
for that sod.

250
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:08,602
Watch your tongue, Norman.

251
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:11,438
I'll watch nothin'
except my own ways.

252
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:14,441
You watch your brother,
or I'll do it for you.

253
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,361
If he ever makes
a mistake again in any way...

254
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:20,364
I'll be the first
to have him put away.

255
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:27,496
David.! You've been at it for hours.!

256
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,920
Aah!

257
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,965
- Gave me a fright, you did.
- You watching him, are you?

258
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,509
Just lookin'.

259
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,764
Do you fancy him?

260
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:50,060
He's sweet, I think.

261
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:20,090
Want anything?

262
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,600
Want a tomato?

263
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:32,311
- No, thanks.

264
00:22:32,478 --> 00:22:34,855
Want a grapefruit?

265
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,835
- Hey, hey.
- Your move.

266
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,838
Okay.

267
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,763
Check.

268
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:11,266
- No, thank you.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

269
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,811
"This move now...

270
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:17,397
"puts black into
a desperate plight...

271
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:21,652
"with no possibility of mobilizing
his disorganized pieces.

272
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:24,363
"Therefore, he begins
to return material...

273
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:28,242
"to make progress
in developing at any price.

274
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:32,371
Two pawns down,
white can conveniently-"

275
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:37,376
Hey, I bet I can undress,
do my exercises and get into bed
before you make your next move.

276
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,586
- Is it a deal?
- You're on.

277
00:23:41,422 --> 00:23:44,341
- Ah! No cheating.
- I'm not cheating.

278
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:56,103
Shh, David.

279
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:03,068
Aha! I have it.

280
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:09,074
No, no, no, David,
just a minute.

281
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,076
You're supposed to do a hundred.

282
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:13,746
I did a hundred. I counted
by binary numbers. Make your move.

283
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:15,748
- Binary numbers.
- Make your move.

284
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:17,791
- Wait a minute.
- Come on.

285
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:24,798
- What about that one there?
- No.

286
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,347
- Uh-
- It's difficult, isn't it?

287
00:24:32,473 --> 00:24:34,349
Terribly.

288
00:24:34,475 --> 00:24:37,186
Just a minute.

289
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:39,605
I think I have it.

290
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,441
Um-

291
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:44,735
Ooh.

292
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,821
That puts you in.

293
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,928
- Jesus!
- What are you doing?

294
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:13,931
I gotta get my watch off.
You're an animal.

295
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:20,604
Oh, for Christ's sake.

296
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,606
I'm just setting the alarm.

297
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,865
Are you finished?

298
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:40,124
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, no. What now?

299
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,794
David.

300
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:46,672
David, what are you
doing down there?

301
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:49,925
- Looking for a chess piece.
- What are you doing?

302
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,679
Take a look.

303
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:59,685
- Whoa. Did you find it?
- No, not that.

304
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:02,688
Wait a minute.
Let me give you a hand.

305
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:04,940
Aah.!

306
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:07,484
David, no.!

307
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:10,696
- No, wait! Wait a minute!
- You see it? Huh?

308
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:13,031
- No, I didn't find it.
- I think it's a rook.

309
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:16,452
No.! Aah.! No.!

310
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:19,413
Mmm.! I love you.!

311
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:25,586
I never cheat.

312
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:02,414
Look, Amy,
don't play games with me.

313
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,627
I've got a lot on my mind.

314
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:09,129
You're not being fair.
I'm just trying to help.

315
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,514
If you want to help,
then get your friends to finish.

316
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:22,518
Get the garage makers and the
rat catchers- Get them all to finish!

317
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:25,896
- Oh.
- A-And fix the toilet
and clean up the kitchen.

318
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,898
That would be a terrific help!

319
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:34,947
I love you, Amy,
but I want you to leave me alone.

320
00:27:43,122 --> 00:27:44,998
Okay.

321
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:49,086
I'll leave you alone
with your blackboard.

322
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:22,661
Don't play games with me.

323
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:26,749
No.

324
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:29,209
Don't do it, Amy.

325
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:28,393
They were practically licking my body.

326
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,605
Who was practically
licking your body?

327
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:33,649
Venner and Scutt.

328
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:37,444
I congratulate them on their taste.

329
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:39,988
Damn rat catcher staring at me.

330
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,659
Why don't you wear a bra?

331
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:45,661
Why should I?

332
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:52,126
You shouldn't go around without one
and not expect that type to stare.

333
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:55,754
Look...

334
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:59,258
if you could hammer a nail, Venner
and Scutt wouldn't be out there.

335
00:30:02,428 --> 00:30:04,930
Listen, Amy, uh...

336
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:07,975
fixing the toaster
and getting the garage built...

337
00:30:08,142 --> 00:30:11,728
is not exactly the reason
I came here in the first place.

338
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:14,940
Are you saying
you'd be happier if we hadn't left?

339
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:17,901
We left because
I got a grant to do work...

340
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:20,529
which I haven't found
the time to do.

341
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:23,031
You left because...

342
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:26,744
you didn't want
to take a stand, commit.

343
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:29,913
Commit to what?

344
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:37,713
Huh?

345
00:30:42,468 --> 00:30:44,344
I was involved with my work.

346
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:49,308
You want something out of me
that is not right to deliver.
That's not what I was there for.

347
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:58,942
But I know why you're here.

348
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:04,323
Why?

349
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,868
Could it be because there's
no place else to hide?

350
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:32,142
I'm here because you once said...

351
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:38,315
y-you thought
we could be happier here.

352
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,610
Remember?

353
00:31:45,114 --> 00:31:47,116
I'm sorry.

354
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:51,412
Are you sorry sorry,
or just sorry?

355
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:58,335
Sorry sorry.

356
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:00,796
Then come here.

357
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:14,935
I'm gonna take a bath.

358
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,938
Why?
You don't need one.

359
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:19,940
I think I do.

360
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:32,411
Hey.

361
00:32:34,747 --> 00:32:38,792
By the way, I never claimed to be
one of the, uh, "involved."

362
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:04,443
Don't forget
to draw the curtains.!

363
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:23,879
- Hello.
- Hi.

364
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:30,969
Thinking?

365
00:33:31,095 --> 00:33:32,971
Mm-hmm.

366
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:38,352
- Don't want to come
for a walk, do you?
- Sure.

367
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:41,814
When?

368
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:43,816
In a little while.

369
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:49,113
Hey, hey, come on.
Come on.

370
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:03,419
Hello.

371
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:05,421
Good evening.

372
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:09,133
Kitty.! Kitty.!

373
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:11,135
Kitty, kitty.

374
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:15,431
David, I can't find the cat.!

375
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:18,934
Can you forget the cat
and let me work for a minute!

376
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:24,440
Kitty.!

377
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:26,859
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

378
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:28,861
Kitty.!

379
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:30,863
Kitty.!

380
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:34,366
- Kitty? Kitty, kitty?

381
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,994
"Kitty, kitty.
Kitty, kitty, kitty."

382
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,705
- Shit.
- Here, kitty, kitty.

383
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:46,211
Other side, sir.

384
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:59,224
- Hang on. Hang on.

385
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:02,019
- Hold it, hold it.
- Wait for him for a minute.

386
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:42,101
Where be the blackbird

387
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:46,563
- Oh!

388
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:53,779
- Hey, let him pass!
Let's see how good he is!

389
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,867
Whoo!

390
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:04,456
- You're out of your mind.!

391
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:48,125
- Hello, Henry.
- Hello, Janice.

392
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:51,128
Henry! Come here!

393
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:54,423
Oh, he's all right.
Aren't you, Henry?

394
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:08,520
Henry, how many times
I gotta tell you, boy?

395
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,523
You don't listen.

396
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:39,218
Come on.

397
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:41,720
Come on, Henry.
We're going home.

398
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:45,057
What do you want?

399
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,852
You'd have known for sure what
she was after 20 years ago, eh, Tom?

400
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:51,647
- Now, now, that'll do.

401
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,235
- They still down at the hall bingoin'?
- Yeah.

402
00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:59,071
Tell her I'm behavin' meself.
I'll be along soon.

403
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:01,031
Bobby.!

404
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:04,493
Run along now.

405
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:09,623
- Hello, David.
- Hi.

406
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:11,291
Bobby!

407
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:15,379
Take care of your sister, mind.

408
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:17,381
I will, Dad.

409
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:20,384
- Bye, Mr. Sumner.
- Good-bye.

410
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:32,563
I'd like a scotch, double...

411
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:34,898
with ice.

412
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:50,748
Cheers.

413
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:00,883
- Evening, Major.

414
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:02,009
- Evening, Major.
- Evening, Major.

415
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:02,926
- Evening, Major.
- Evening, Major.

416
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,637
- Mr. Sumner?
- Yes?

417
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:09,683
I was about to call up to your farm to
welcome you into our little community.

418
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:11,685
I've just been welcomed.

419
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:15,397
- I'm John Scott.
- Hello.

420
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:18,901
I saw your car outside. I thought
perhaps we could drive up together.

421
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:21,153
I wanted to have
the good Reverend and Mrs. Hood...

422
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:25,240
talk you into joining us at the
church social this coming Thursday.

423
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,451
The vicar will run me home.

424
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:30,329
Can I buy you a drink, Major,
before you go?

425
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:34,083
No, thank you, Tom.
We're in a hurry.

426
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:44,301
Buy 'em all one.

427
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:52,142
- Good night, Major.
- Good night, Major.

428
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:54,228
Watch out for sheep.!

429
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:57,231
- You got your
Wellington boots on, Major?

430
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:02,236
Now, some men
goes for women

431
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:05,239
And some men
goes for boys

432
00:40:05,364 --> 00:40:08,242
But my love's
warm and beautiful

433
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:10,494
And makes
a baa-in' noise

434
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,539
- Amy, nice to see you.

435
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:16,750
- Major, why haven't you
been out to see us before?
- Shearing time. My apologies.

436
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:19,795
- I see you brought
my drunken husband home.
- Come on, I'm not drunk yet.

437
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,422
Certainly not my fault.

438
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,507
- Hi. I'm David Sumner.
- I just brought him home.

439
00:40:23,632 --> 00:40:25,551
- Barny Hood.
- Reverend.

440
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:27,553
- My wife.
- Mrs. Hood.

441
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:30,556
- Hello.
- Well, well. Please sit down.

442
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:33,016
- Barny. Louise.
- Hello, Major.

443
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:40,858
- What are you drinking, Reverend?

444
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:42,901
Scotch.

445
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:54,246
The reverend and his wife...

446
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:57,291
came to invite us to a party
at the church hall next week, David.

447
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:59,293
Oh.

448
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:02,713
Well, it's, uh, going to be more than
an invitation, Reverend, isn't it?

449
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:05,382
Major, you gave away
our secret plan.

450
00:41:05,466 --> 00:41:08,427
- Who said anything about money?
- I was thinking of about five-

451
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:11,054
I'll take it.
Thank you very much.

452
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,099
And I expect to see you both
at the social and at the church...

453
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:16,143
when you can spare the time.

454
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:20,856
Time is a little difficult to find
these days. Uh, so are cats.

455
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:24,610
By the way, Amy, did you find
your, uh, kitty, kitty, kitty?

456
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:27,780
No.

457
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:30,783
At least give us some hope
about your coming to church.

458
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:34,411
- Yes. After all, hope is your business,
Barny, isn't it?
- Yes, and faith.

459
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:37,790
- And charity.

460
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:40,793
- Thanks.
- Amy's been telling us
why you came to Wakely.

461
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:43,796
- To write, to meditate.
- Why did you come?

462
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:46,090
I was drafted.

463
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:48,133
- Well, tell us what you do.
- Okay.

464
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:52,012
I'm a, uh,
astral mathematician.

465
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,348
Oh. Never heard of it.

466
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:57,142
- That's because I just made it up.

467
00:41:57,351 --> 00:41:59,144
I'll get you another drink.

468
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:01,980
I have a grant to study, uh...

469
00:42:02,106 --> 00:42:05,901
possible structures
in stellar interiors...

470
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:08,779
and the implications regarding
their radiation characteristics.

471
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:12,074
- Am I boring anyone?
- Radiation- That's
an unfortunate dispensation.

472
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:15,369
It surely is.
Yes, indeed.

473
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:18,664
As long as it's not
another bomb.

474
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:22,000
You're a scientist.
Can you deny the responsibility?

475
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:23,627
Can you?

476
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:28,424
After all, there's never been
a kingdom given to so much bloodshed...

477
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:30,717
as that of Christ.

478
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:35,013
- That's Montesquieu, isn't it?
- Oh, really?

479
00:42:35,139 --> 00:42:37,307
Who's he?

480
00:42:39,268 --> 00:42:41,145
Somebody well worth reading.

481
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:47,484
We'd better leave
these good people.

482
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:50,779
Yes, well, you won't let me
walk home, will you, Barny?

483
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:53,157
Mrs. Hood,
you're very lovely.

484
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:55,701
- I'll get your coat.
- Does God bore you, Amy?

485
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:58,704
In the areas of boredom, Mrs. Hood,
God is not my problem.

486
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,835
You were... awful
to the reverend.

487
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:07,212
No, no, no, no.
I wasn't.

488
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:10,841
He's all right.
I like him.

489
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:12,926
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

490
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:15,095
His wife is very attractive.

491
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:17,639
Oh.

492
00:43:17,765 --> 00:43:20,184
Yes, she is, isn't she?

493
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:27,524
- Here, I think l-
I think you need some help.

494
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:31,195
- David.
- Hmm?

495
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:33,947
What's a binary number?

496
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:37,743
Uh, zeroes or ones...

497
00:43:37,951 --> 00:43:39,787
plus or minus.

498
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:43,916
In sequences of twos.

499
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,001
- Hey, that's right.

500
00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:49,963
You're a bright lady.

501
00:43:52,091 --> 00:43:53,675
You're not so dumb.

502
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:56,887
Sometimes I need help.

503
00:43:57,012 --> 00:43:58,931
When?

504
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:03,644
Like, um, now, maybe.

505
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:10,442
You got it.

506
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,992
What's the matter?

507
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:04,621
Scutt or Cawsey.

508
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:12,337
I've locked all the doors
and windows downstairs.

509
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:15,132
Let's keep them locked
from now on. All right?

510
00:45:15,257 --> 00:45:17,176
Great.

511
00:45:22,055 --> 00:45:23,932
Did you hear me?

512
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:25,934
What?

513
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,479
Scutt or Cawsey.

514
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:33,609
- Why?
- To prove to you they could
get into your bedroom.

515
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:40,199
I don't believe that.

516
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:43,744
Well, who else
is around all the time?

517
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:45,746
Amy, uh...

518
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:48,248
we've left all...
the doors unlocked.

519
00:45:48,373 --> 00:45:50,959
I mean, it could have
been anybody passing.

520
00:45:51,085 --> 00:45:53,003
- "Anybody passing"?

521
00:45:53,087 --> 00:45:56,006
David, a complete stranger
comes into our house...

522
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:59,093
and decides to strangle our cat
and hang her in the wardrobe?

523
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:01,595
- Somebody passing?

524
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:20,197
Cawsey or Scutt.

525
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:26,328
Here, Charlie.
It's bloody heavy.

526
00:46:26,328 --> 00:46:27,579
Here, Charlie.
It's bloody heavy.

527
00:46:27,704 --> 00:46:30,582
Lousy way to make a livin; though.

528
00:46:30,707 --> 00:46:33,085
You gonna look at them all day?

529
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:38,841
Would you feel better
if I went out and talked to them?

530
00:46:38,966 --> 00:46:42,594
Not necessarily.
Perhaps we could just pack up and leave.

531
00:46:44,096 --> 00:46:45,973
Nobody's leaving.

532
00:46:47,516 --> 00:46:49,768
Why? Because we paid for a year?

533
00:46:51,145 --> 00:46:54,231
Look, Amy,
I'm not going to...

534
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:57,276
just go out there
and blatantly accuse them.

535
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,696
You don't have to accuse them.

536
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:05,743
You could start by mentioning that our
cat was strangled and see what happens.

537
00:47:08,162 --> 00:47:10,706
You can believe in the possibility,
can't you?

538
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:13,041
Okay. Okay.

539
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:18,422
I'll go out and mention to them
that the cat is missing...

540
00:47:18,547 --> 00:47:21,467
and I'll ask them
if they've seen her.

541
00:47:23,552 --> 00:47:26,430
All right,
let's see what it's good for.

542
00:47:27,806 --> 00:47:30,476
- You don't think that's enough, do you?
- Not quite.

543
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:35,647
Perhaps you'd like to write them
a note on your blackboard.

544
00:47:39,568 --> 00:47:42,488
Well, I thought he might enjoy it.

545
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:03,675
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you, sir.

546
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:06,303
- How's it, uh, going up there?
- It's all right, sir.

547
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:08,639
Yeah. Want a smoke?

548
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:11,683
I like the smell of those
American cigarettes, Mr. Sumner.

549
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:20,150
Can you give me a hand with that
mantrap? Just wanna get it in the house.

550
00:48:35,249 --> 00:48:37,418
Uh, right through here.

551
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:39,920
Right here by the fireplace.

552
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:41,922
Thanks.

553
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:50,305
Amy, listen.
I'm gonna catch them off guard.

554
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,350
- When?
- Right now.

555
00:48:53,434 --> 00:48:56,061
Open or closed, Mr. Sumner?

556
00:48:58,188 --> 00:49:00,149
Uh, gee, I don't know.

557
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:03,902
Uh, open it.

558
00:49:06,405 --> 00:49:08,907
If you can.

559
00:49:15,664 --> 00:49:17,583
Sorry, Charlie.

560
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:19,585
Bite, sir.

561
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:22,963
I can appreciate that.

562
00:49:24,673 --> 00:49:26,592
Be careful.

563
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:31,180
Watch that hand
on the spring.

564
00:49:31,305 --> 00:49:33,682
Pretty dangerous thing, sir.

565
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:41,899
- This is the, uh, safety lock, sir.
- Right.

566
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:43,942
Where would you like it, sir?

567
00:49:44,026 --> 00:49:46,570
Uh, put it right over
the fireplace there.

568
00:49:53,494 --> 00:49:55,704
You fellows like some beer?

569
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:58,749
- Very nice.
- Oh, very welcome.

570
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,424
Thank you.

571
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:13,847
Cheers.

572
00:50:23,315 --> 00:50:25,275
Uh, cheers, miss.

573
00:50:25,401 --> 00:50:27,653
Cheers.

574
00:50:29,405 --> 00:50:31,490
- Mr. Sumner.
- Huh?

575
00:50:31,615 --> 00:50:34,535
Would you like to
shoot with us sometime?

576
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:38,163
Oh, I've, uh-
I never hunted much.

577
00:50:39,373 --> 00:50:42,543
Oh, but you've, uh,
shot, Mr. Sumner?

578
00:50:44,503 --> 00:50:46,797
Just once or twice,
but that was-

579
00:50:46,922 --> 00:50:49,174
Be easy then.
You should try it, sir.

580
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:53,220
Living here at Trencher's, with good
shootin'outside the door. Eh, Norman?

581
00:50:53,345 --> 00:50:55,347
Right. Right, sir.

582
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:02,688
When?

583
00:51:02,813 --> 00:51:04,690
How about tomorrow, sir?

584
00:51:08,944 --> 00:51:10,863
Okay. Thank you.

585
00:51:10,946 --> 00:51:15,200
That m- That might be... fun.
I'd like that.

586
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:17,703
Thank you.

587
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:24,042
What about the garage?

588
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:25,836
It can wait.

589
00:51:34,678 --> 00:51:37,639
We'll meet at Wakely
at about half past 8:00.

590
00:51:37,765 --> 00:51:40,893
- You know the pub?
- Yes, I do.

591
00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:43,395
Well, we'd better
get back to work, sir.

592
00:51:43,479 --> 00:51:45,689
Thank you for putting that up.

593
00:51:45,814 --> 00:51:48,233
That's all right, sir.

594
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:50,360
Oh, I, uh,
I don't have a gun.

595
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:52,404
But, uh-

596
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:54,031
will this do?

597
00:51:54,156 --> 00:51:56,075
Ah.

598
00:51:56,158 --> 00:51:58,243
There'll be plenty extra, sir.

599
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:00,079
Good.

600
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:02,081
- Thank you for the drink, sir.
- Thank you.

601
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:04,041
- You're welcome.
- Thanks for the drink, sir.

602
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:05,918
Oh, it's my pleasure.

603
00:52:41,662 --> 00:52:44,581
Hey, Charlie, Charlie.
Wait, wait, wait.
