1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,740
Break it, Mr. Sumner.

2
00:00:02,884 --> 00:00:05,318
- Why? It's not loaded.
- Break it.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,990
Now you're sure.

00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:43,680
Uh, this'll be you
right over here, Mr. Sumner.

6
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:45,655
Right.

7
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:51,364
Now, here's your sack.

8
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:55,297
We'll beat the ducks
right to ya.

9
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:57,336
- Small, they are.
- Yeah.

10
00:00:57,405 --> 00:01:01,932
We don't want it broken up
with shot unless you have to.

11
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,273
But, uh, if-
if you can't catch 'em...

12
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,280
shoot 'em.

13
00:01:08,384 --> 00:01:10,817
They might come
right down here, sir.

14
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:14,820
- Or they might come
from behind as well, sir.
- But I don't move?

15
00:01:14,923 --> 00:01:17,356
Stay as still
as you can be, sir.

16
00:01:19,827 --> 00:01:22,855
Now, we'll be spread about.
If you need us, just call.

17
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,557
You do that.
Here's your sack, Norman.

18
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,097
- You drive 'em to me, Charlie.
- I will.

19
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:35,266
Uh, good luck, sir.

20
00:01:40,882 --> 00:01:42,817
Might be a little while, sir.

21
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:45,916
I'll be here.

22
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:17,076
Who is it?

23
00:03:34,695 --> 00:03:37,061
Is David all right?

24
00:03:37,164 --> 00:03:39,929
He's fine.
Enjoying himself.

25
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:43,369
May I come in?

26
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:46,369
All right.

27
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:53,070
- Would you like a drink?
- I'd love one.

28
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,101
Would you like me to go?
I will, you know.

29
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:18,338
No.

30
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:20,372
Stay and have your drink.

31
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:21,943
I'd like to know
what you think of cats.

32
00:04:21,943 --> 00:04:23,376
I'd like to know
what you think of cats.

33
00:04:30,217 --> 00:04:32,117
I do fancy cats.

34
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:45,197
Please leave me.

35
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:51,637
No.

36
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:02,914
Get out!

37
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:24,704
Don't tease me, Amy.

38
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:28,675
Please.

39
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:42,314
Aah! Aah!

40
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:44,356
No!

41
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,289
Aah!

42
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:16,355
No.

43
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:18,481
Please, Charlie.

44
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:27,532
Amy.

45
00:06:27,635 --> 00:06:30,934
I don't want to reave you, but I will.

46
00:06:36,244 --> 00:06:38,610
No.

47
00:06:38,713 --> 00:06:41,943
- No. No.

48
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:55,588
No! No!

49
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:09,509
No!

50
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,579
No!

51
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:16,081
No.

52
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:30,496
Amy!

53
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:13,365
N-No.

54
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:08,427
Easy.

55
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:47,099
I'm sorry, Amy.

56
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:49,135
I'm sorry.

57
00:09:49,237 --> 00:09:51,137
Hold me.

58
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:55,701
Hold me.

59
00:11:55,663 --> 00:11:58,597
- No.

60
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:05,635
No.! No.! No.!

61
00:14:06,894 --> 00:14:09,157
Why didn't you open the closet?

62
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:11,526
We don't have any more cats.

63
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:21,942
I'm firing Venner
and Scutt tomorrow.

64
00:14:23,343 --> 00:14:25,278
Hooray for you, tiger.

65
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,451
What for?

66
00:14:35,923 --> 00:14:39,289
Because they stuck it to me
on the moor today.

67
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:42,793
They also serve
who sit at home and wait.

68
00:14:44,398 --> 00:14:46,559
What?

69
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,135
Nothing. If you'd have said
something to them ages ago...

70
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:51,635
- about the cat, this would
never have happened.
- Easy.

71
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:53,730
- None of it.
- Easy, easy.

72
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,172
I was going to say something
until you pulled that childish stunt...

73
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:59,039
and ruined any chance
I had of finding out.

74
00:14:59,146 --> 00:15:01,047
- David, I didn't-
- I didn't finish.

75
00:15:01,148 --> 00:15:03,911
- You pushed me, and you don't do
any good by pushing.
- I didn't.

76
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:13,058
When are you ever gonna
learn about growing up, huh?

77
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:16,794
I'm trying to.

78
00:15:16,897 --> 00:15:18,922
Well, you're a little late.

79
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:26,335
Why didn't you ask him
instead of making me look like
an idiot with that bowl of milk?

80
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:28,805
You're a coward.

81
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:33,273
- No, I'm not.
- And I'm a coward.

82
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:36,447
Plain and simple.

83
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:38,746
No, I'm not.

84
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:42,789
I don't blame you
for hiding in your study.

85
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:44,791
I don't-

86
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:47,019
I don't want to
hide there with you.

87
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:53,132
L- I can't anymore.

88
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:01,840
Okay.

89
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:07,474
Easy, easy, easy.

90
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:22,425
- You're fired, all of you.
- I beg your pardon, sir?

91
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,965
I've noted the hours
that you've worked...

92
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:28,762
and I've deducted...
the-the time wasted.

93
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:32,237
- Here. It's all here.
- Why, sir? Why are we fired?

94
00:16:32,372 --> 00:16:34,637
We may not work the way
you like to work, sir-

95
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:37,608
- Listen to me.
- Sir, I mean, why?

96
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:41,375
You're fired because I don't want you
around. I want you to leave. Right now.

97
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:44,076
- Is that clear?
- We've been working all the time, sir.

98
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,345
Clear enough, sir.

99
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:18,217
- Norman.
- Huh?

100
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:21,255
That's a nice way
to treat people.

101
00:18:19,246 --> 00:18:22,579
We're due at the church hall at 8:00.

102
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,853
I'd like you
to meet Amy and David Sumner.

103
00:18:58,952 --> 00:19:02,219
- Hello. Nice to meet you. My husband.
- Hello, Mr. Sumner.

104
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:04,257
Hello, Amy.
Nice of you to come.

105
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:07,487
I'll show you to your seats.

106
00:19:07,595 --> 00:19:10,429
Hello, Reverend.
How have you been?

107
00:19:25,713 --> 00:19:27,648
- Please sit here.
- Thank you.

108
00:19:27,747 --> 00:19:30,182
- I think she'll be able
to see okay from here.
- That's fine.

109
00:19:42,697 --> 00:19:45,563
Would you care for a drink?

110
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:49,295
All right. Thank you.

111
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,983
I hope you enjoy the show.

112
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:07,610
Thank you.

113
00:20:07,755 --> 00:20:10,121
Be brave.

114
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:29,099
- Evening, ladies and gentlemen...

115
00:20:33,613 --> 00:20:35,548
and welcome to our
annual social gathering.

116
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:38,949
It's nice to see again
all the old familiar faces.

117
00:20:39,054 --> 00:20:41,077
And the not-so-old,
indeed, as well.

118
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,713
To begin the evening, we have
our very own Reverend Barnard Hood.

119
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:48,224
Your vicar,
ladies and gentlemen.

120
00:20:48,362 --> 00:20:53,528
Thank you very much.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
for my famous newspaper trick.

121
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,657
Tore it up last year, Barny!

122
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:59,465
Yes, and I might well
next year, too, Tom.

123
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:05,336
Here we are, ladies and gentlemen-
a very simple trick.

124
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:08,345
I simply tear a piece
of newspaper down the center so.

125
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:12,077
Tear it again.
Fold it towards me.

126
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,550
Music, please.

127
00:21:14,688 --> 00:21:19,387
Open it up very carefully.
Tear it again.

128
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:22,519
There we are.
Roll it towards me again.

129
00:21:22,662 --> 00:21:24,858
- You enjoy this, Mrs. Johnson?
- Yes, Vicar.

130
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:28,162
It is a good trick, isn't it? I do it
in front of the mirror every night.

131
00:21:28,302 --> 00:21:30,496
And we begin to open up.

132
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:33,264
- I always enjoy doing this.
It gives me a chance to...
- Hello, David.

133
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:34,840
Catch up with my reading.

134
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:36,840
Hi.

135
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,007
You want a smoke?

136
00:21:42,182 --> 00:21:46,345
And I find that
it hasn't been torn at all.

137
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:49,286
- No.
- What?
- Don't smoke in here.

138
00:21:49,423 --> 00:21:51,914
And you'll also find that
that one isn't torn either.

139
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:54,994
- Sorry about that, ladies and gentlemen.

140
00:21:55,095 --> 00:21:57,724
But I think
you'll probably find that...

141
00:21:57,865 --> 00:22:00,528
it hasn't been torn at all.

142
00:22:05,273 --> 00:22:08,934
- Hello, Henry.
- Hello.

143
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:14,679
I'd like to go for a walk.

144
00:22:14,814 --> 00:22:17,943
- Will you take my arm?
- Now, ladies and gentlemen...

145
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,280
for my piÈce de rÈsistance...

146
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,912
I now present to you an empty glass.

147
00:22:24,057 --> 00:22:26,492
I am now going to fill
this glass with milk.

148
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,291
Would it work better
with whiskey, vicar?

149
00:22:29,396 --> 00:22:31,590
- Nothing works better with whiskey.
- I do.

150
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:33,791
You've never worked
in your life, Tom.

151
00:22:38,338 --> 00:22:42,775
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I take the lid off my cocoa tin.

152
00:22:42,943 --> 00:22:47,039
And very carefully now,
I place the glass...

153
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,639
into the tin
and replace the lid.

154
00:22:50,784 --> 00:22:54,311
I take up my wand
and I utter the magic words-

155
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:03,295
What do we find in the tin...

156
00:23:03,398 --> 00:23:06,697
but one complete...

157
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:08,802
glass of milk.

158
00:23:08,903 --> 00:23:12,894
- Yea.!
- Good old Barny!

159
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:16,635
If I could convert you
to this, Tom, that would be a miracle.

160
00:23:20,914 --> 00:23:23,884
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Major.

161
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,144
The next item on this evening's
program, ladies and gentlemen...

162
00:23:27,287 --> 00:23:30,688
- You want to go?
- Yeah.

163
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:34,693
...who will sing for you the aria
Caranome from the opera Rigoletto.

164
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,760
Dad?
It's Janice.

165
00:24:15,903 --> 00:24:19,032
She made off to the yard.
Then she went walking with Henry Niles.

166
00:24:19,171 --> 00:24:21,367
He was holding her, Dad.
Touching her.

167
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:24,476
John Niles.

168
00:24:24,612 --> 00:24:27,273
What's the matter, Tom?

169
00:24:34,755 --> 00:24:37,121
Come with me.

170
00:24:44,097 --> 00:24:46,657
All over her, he was.
Touching her.

171
00:24:48,536 --> 00:24:51,470
- Had his hands all over her.

172
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,086
Don't be afraid, Henry.

173
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,086
- I'll find him.
- No.

174
00:25:10,224 --> 00:25:12,157
Let the boys find Janice.
The rest can wait.

175
00:25:15,063 --> 00:25:17,327
Have you ever kissed
anyone, Henry?

176
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:19,795
No.

177
00:25:19,934 --> 00:25:23,266
Get your mates to find her. I'll be
waiting in the pub. Get all of them!

178
00:25:24,771 --> 00:25:27,639
Would you like to kiss me?

179
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:40,744
Go on. Find him!

180
00:25:42,555 --> 00:25:45,389
Would you now all please stand?

181
00:26:03,443 --> 00:26:07,742
As these lights are
extinguished in our eyes...

182
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:13,814
and also in the presence of God,
the Blessed Virgin...

183
00:26:13,954 --> 00:26:16,184
and all the saints-

184
00:26:20,728 --> 00:26:25,425
Deliver unto the devil
a punishment with eternal fire.

185
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:30,166
Dwell without him...

186
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:34,367
unless ye repent.

187
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,068
- Janice?
- Janice.!

188
00:26:37,244 --> 00:26:40,179
- Amen.
- Amen.

189
00:26:40,347 --> 00:26:44,250
- I have to go.
- No. No, they might hurt you.

190
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:53,126
- Janice.!
- Come here.!

191
00:26:53,226 --> 00:26:56,389
- Where are you, Janice?
- Henry.!

192
00:26:57,798 --> 00:27:00,528
Janice.!

193
00:27:13,014 --> 00:27:15,947
We don't know where she is.
We looked the whole town!

194
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:18,880
- Keep looking.
- The fog's coming down.

195
00:27:18,985 --> 00:27:22,420
Did you try the lorries and such,
parked outside the meeting house?

196
00:27:22,488 --> 00:27:24,548
- Then do it!
- I'll go with him, Pa.

197
00:27:24,692 --> 00:27:27,523
- Janice?
- Janice.!

198
00:27:29,595 --> 00:27:32,224
Janice.!

199
00:27:50,851 --> 00:27:53,581
We're almost home now.

200
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:02,757
Can I help?

201
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:07,731
- David!

202
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:14,470
Jesus! I couldn't stop.

203
00:28:14,574 --> 00:28:17,840
- Oh, God, David.!
- Easy.

204
00:28:19,545 --> 00:28:21,912
Okay. Get the keys.

205
00:28:22,014 --> 00:28:24,211
Easy. Easy.

206
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:30,554
David, you know it's Henry Niles?

207
00:28:30,657 --> 00:28:32,523
I don't want him here.

208
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:35,354
He's hurt.

209
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:38,521
I don't want him in my house.

210
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:41,929
Fine. You get upstairs.
You go to bed.

211
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:44,833
Take a bath.
You just get out of here.

212
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:50,173
He'll stay until the doctor comes.

213
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:53,179
What do you mean,
you don't want him in your house?

214
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,525
- David, did you get anyone?
- No.!

215
00:29:06,626 --> 00:29:10,528
I tried the doctor. He's not home,
and the consul's not either.

216
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,827
Nobody answers.
I'm calling the pub.

217
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:30,979
- Wakely Arms.
- Hello, this is David Sumner.

218
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:34,914
No. No, he ain't.

219
00:29:35,054 --> 00:29:39,014
Oh. Well, when he comes in,
tell him to call Trencher's Farm.

220
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:42,492
I've got Henry Niles here.

221
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,563
Right.

222
00:29:44,697 --> 00:29:46,996
It was the American,
looking for Allsopp.

223
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:49,863
He hit Henry Niles with his car.

224
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,269
He's got him up at Trencher's.

225
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:56,275
Bottle.

226
00:29:58,478 --> 00:30:00,378
And another.

227
00:30:38,418 --> 00:30:41,251
Let Norman and me go in, Tom.

228
00:30:41,353 --> 00:30:43,255
We know the American.

229
00:30:43,356 --> 00:30:47,259
- I want to know where myJanice is.
- We'll find out, Tom.

230
00:30:47,394 --> 00:30:49,954
Riddaway will stay with you, Tom.

231
00:30:50,063 --> 00:30:52,554
That I will.

232
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:06,875
- You have Henry Niles in there?
- Wait a minute. Is the doctor with you?

233
00:31:07,014 --> 00:31:09,641
- We want to see Niles.
- Why? What's the matter?

234
00:31:11,284 --> 00:31:13,548
Wake up!

235
00:31:13,653 --> 00:31:16,588
- Wake up!
- Don't try to kid us
you're sleeping. Come on.!

236
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:19,251
- Hey, wait a minute, now.
- Come on! Come on!

237
00:31:19,393 --> 00:31:21,519
He's hurt.
He could have a broken rib.

238
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:23,561
Oh. Sorry, sir.

239
00:31:25,432 --> 00:31:29,367
He'll have more than a broken rib if he
doesn't tell us whereJanice Hedden is.

240
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:32,266
- What aboutJanice Hedden?
- Took her, he did.

241
00:31:32,405 --> 00:31:34,497
What have you done with Janice Hedden,
you dirty pervert?

242
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:37,438
Lookee here. He played
his filthy tricks on Janice Hedden.

243
00:31:37,577 --> 00:31:39,704
He took her, and he was seen
with his hands on her body.

244
00:31:39,845 --> 00:31:42,077
She run, he run after her,
and now she's missing.

245
00:31:42,182 --> 00:31:44,206
- Look, I understand your concern-
- You-

246
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:46,912
Don't touch him!
Don't do that.

247
00:31:51,157 --> 00:31:53,717
Don't lay your hands on me!

248
00:31:57,465 --> 00:32:01,094
It's none of your business,
and it never has been.

249
00:32:03,804 --> 00:32:05,702
That's fine.

250
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,867
But you can't hit him.

251
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:12,876
Listen, Mr. Sumner...

252
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:15,778
we come to get
this bloody freak.

253
00:32:15,882 --> 00:32:17,942
And we're gonna get him...

254
00:32:18,085 --> 00:32:21,019
with your cooperation or without it.

255
00:32:21,121 --> 00:32:24,023
David, stop it.!

256
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:35,260
Hey, listen.

257
00:32:35,403 --> 00:32:39,394
Listen, Henry, did you see
Janice Hedden tonight?

258
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:42,567
Of course he did. Ain't you listenin'
to me? He did his dirty numbers on her.

259
00:32:42,675 --> 00:32:46,041
Just take it easy.
Henry, listen to me.

260
00:32:46,146 --> 00:32:51,550
Did you takeJanice Hedden out
of the meeting house tonight? Huh?

261
00:32:51,684 --> 00:32:54,675
Listen to me. Please.

262
00:32:54,822 --> 00:32:57,813
Gentlemen, he's helpless.
Look at him. He couldn't hurt a fly.

263
00:33:00,894 --> 00:33:04,023
You'd be better off looking for
Janice Hedden than standing around here.

264
00:33:04,164 --> 00:33:06,599
You know?

265
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:09,724
All right. We go find Janice,
you go find the doctor.

266
00:33:16,543 --> 00:33:18,407
I'm not leaving him here
with my wife.

267
00:33:18,545 --> 00:33:20,478
- Thought you said he was helpless.
- Yeah.

268
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:23,171
You wouldn't leave him alone with your
wife or your kid, if you had one.

269
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:26,318
Oh, that's different, huh?

270
00:33:26,487 --> 00:33:28,920
Look- Look, fella.

271
00:33:29,023 --> 00:33:31,992
He's staying here with me until
the doctor and the police arrive.

272
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:35,287
- He's my responsibility.
- Your responsibility?

273
00:33:35,394 --> 00:33:37,956
- That's right.
- Why?

274
00:33:45,438 --> 00:33:48,202
This is my house.

275
00:33:51,443 --> 00:33:54,710
Okay, come on.

276
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:56,713
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.

277
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:03,912
The police'll be here soon.

278
00:34:24,811 --> 00:34:27,507
What did the bastard say?

279
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,545
Didn't talk.

280
00:34:29,682 --> 00:34:32,173
Well, why didn't you make him?
That's what you went in there for!

281
00:34:38,023 --> 00:34:42,018
- Uh, David-
- Why don't you just go make some coffee?

282
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,463
I want that Niles.!
I'm goin'in.

283
00:34:54,206 --> 00:34:57,472
- Please, David. Stop them.
- Don't worry.

284
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:04,907
Solid. They can't break in.

285
00:35:08,621 --> 00:35:10,987
I know how they feel.

286
00:35:11,157 --> 00:35:14,217
I'd feel the same way if it was
my kid that was missing.

287
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,157
Amy, go to bed, huh? Go on.

288
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:23,269
I can handle this.

289
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:30,541
You give me that Niles!

290
00:35:30,677 --> 00:35:35,081
Hey! Hey, cut it out!

291
00:35:35,215 --> 00:35:39,708
Listen to me. If you don't stop now,
so help me God I'll press charges!

292
00:35:57,237 --> 00:36:00,103
Okay, you've had your fun.

293
00:36:00,206 --> 00:36:02,470
I'll give you one more chance.

294
00:36:02,608 --> 00:36:07,206
And if you don't clear out now,
there'll be real trouble. I mean it.

295
00:36:15,255 --> 00:36:19,157
- Chris.!
- Come on. They're gonna cooperate now.

296
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:21,054
Just go on upstairs.
Don't worry.

297
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:24,095
- Where are you going?
- I'm just gonna fix the window.

298
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,242
- Do you think we ought to
clear off, Norman?
- Why?

299
00:36:38,412 --> 00:36:41,778
We'll get that Niles.
I tell you we will.

300
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,715
- Well, why stop then?

301
00:36:47,954 --> 00:36:50,514
He's got no right to live,
an animal like that.

302
00:36:50,689 --> 00:36:52,715
Tom, I'll run 'round,
I'll slip in the window...

303
00:36:52,826 --> 00:36:54,849
and get that Niles out
quick as a flash.

304
00:36:55,028 --> 00:36:57,862
Uh, the rest of you, kick up a row.

305
00:37:02,735 --> 00:37:04,670
Hey.!

306
00:37:07,173 --> 00:37:09,608
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

307
00:37:09,675 --> 00:37:13,237
It's that snipe
we're after, Mr. Sumner.

308
00:37:13,345 --> 00:37:16,838
- I said stay down!
- I want the lavvy.

309
00:37:18,284 --> 00:37:20,251
Come on.

310
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:22,478
Look, you stupid Yank.

311
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:25,420
Let's have Niles
before someone gets hurt!

312
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:27,925
Come on. Up you go.

313
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:32,461
I've had to put up
with a lot in my time.

314
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:34,657
- You can't leave him in there.

315
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,362
But I draw the line at this place.

316
00:37:37,503 --> 00:37:39,903
- No.!

317
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:43,009
I'll have an answer,
or I'll have blood!

318
00:37:43,175 --> 00:37:46,144
- Where are you going?

319
00:37:46,278 --> 00:37:48,942
Give Niles to them.
That's what they want.

320
00:37:54,554 --> 00:37:57,318
They just want him.

321
00:38:03,595 --> 00:38:05,996
Give them Niles, David!

322
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:12,731
- They'll beat him to death.
- I don't care.

323
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:15,305
You send him out,
or your whole house will be-

324
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:17,909
Get him out!

325
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:23,581
You really don't care, do you?

326
00:38:24,684 --> 00:38:26,983
No, I don't.

327
00:38:27,086 --> 00:38:28,782
Cawsey.!

328
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:34,425
Come here.!

329
00:38:34,528 --> 00:38:36,894
There's more whiskey
in the lorry.!

330
00:38:38,798 --> 00:38:41,893
No. I care.

331
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:47,235
This is where I live.

332
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,206
This is me.

333
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:53,068
I will not allow violence
against this house.

334
00:38:59,485 --> 00:39:01,976
Don't worry.

335
00:39:02,121 --> 00:39:04,554
- Go on upstairs.

336
00:39:04,689 --> 00:39:06,818
- Beautiful.!
- Please don't leave me.

337
00:39:06,925 --> 00:39:09,121
Just do as you're told.

338
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:19,867
Get out of there!

339
00:39:20,005 --> 00:39:20,268
- David? It's me, Major Scott.

340
00:39:29,983 --> 00:39:32,679
- Come on.
- Thank you.

341
00:39:32,818 --> 00:39:35,152
I see you finally got
through the enemy lines.

342
00:39:35,255 --> 00:39:37,449
Don't worry about that.
I'll tell them to clear off.

343
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,318
Sorry I didn't get here earlier.

344
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:42,121
Yeah, I am too.
They're breaking all my windows.

345
00:39:42,228 --> 00:39:44,753
David, Janice Hedden is missing.

346
00:39:44,898 --> 00:39:47,195
Tom is out of his mind with worry.
They're drunk out there.

347
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,233
I know that,
but you're the law here.

348
00:39:49,302 --> 00:39:52,829
Oh, where can he be

349
00:39:57,644 --> 00:39:59,612
I don'tjust kill 'em,
you know. I breed 'em as well.

350
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:03,204
- I'll deal with them.

351
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:06,545
- David!
- Lots more where they came from.

352
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:15,760
Well, Tom, you're being
a bit stupid, aren't you?

353
00:40:15,894 --> 00:40:18,659
Chucking things through people's
windows. You ought to have more sense.

354
00:40:18,798 --> 00:40:21,858
You tell him I want that Niles
or I'll come in and get him!

355
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:25,697
You give me that bloody gun and get
the hell out of here. That's an order.

356
00:40:25,804 --> 00:40:29,798
What about myJanice?
It weren't one of yours.

357
00:40:32,311 --> 00:40:34,836
- He took myJanice.
- Listen, Tom.

358
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:37,416
We don't want any trouble
here, do we?

359
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:42,487
There wouldn't have been any trouble
if you'd put Henry Niles away.

360
00:40:42,588 --> 00:40:45,023
You wanted to put my Emma
away soon enough!

361
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:47,751
Damn you, Hedden.
Give me that gun.

362
00:40:47,894 --> 00:40:49,827
Damn you, Major.
Let go!

363
00:41:05,144 --> 00:41:07,077
- David!
- Bastards!

364
00:41:07,213 --> 00:41:09,112
Bastards.!

365
00:41:10,884 --> 00:41:13,510
You bastards!

366
00:41:19,126 --> 00:41:22,220
David, phone! Phone anybody!

367
00:41:22,362 --> 00:41:24,829
Please, phone somebody!
David!

368
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,228
Phone!

369
00:41:34,372 --> 00:41:36,807
- No calls tonight.
- It's dead.

370
00:41:36,943 --> 00:41:39,309
Get the lights. Go on.

371
00:41:42,048 --> 00:41:45,018
I didn't reckon on nobody
gettin' killed, Norman.

372
00:41:45,152 --> 00:41:48,313
Yeah, well, that's too bad.
We're all in it now.

373
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:55,784
- Accessories, we are.
- That's the law.

374
00:41:58,798 --> 00:42:01,768
Henry Niles!

375
00:42:01,902 --> 00:42:04,927
David, give them Niles.
That's what they want.

376
00:42:12,211 --> 00:42:13,974
I'm gonna keep them
out of this house.

377
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,246
Please! Listen to me!

378
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:20,546
- Come on!
- Shut your mouth. Shut it.

379
00:42:20,653 --> 00:42:23,282
I can hold them off. Don't worry.
Someone will show up.

380
00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:26,391
- David!
- Cut it out!

381
00:42:26,525 --> 00:42:28,686
Like Major Scott?

382
00:42:33,132 --> 00:42:36,000
David, how are you
gonna keep them out?

383
00:42:36,103 --> 00:42:40,037
- I can keep them out.
- How? There are five men out there.

384
00:42:40,171 --> 00:42:44,438
- I know that.
- They have a gun!

385
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:46,773
- I know they have.

386
00:42:49,514 --> 00:42:52,711
- Honey, I know what I'm doing.
- Goddamn you, David!

387
00:42:52,853 --> 00:42:55,376
- If you don't give them Niles, I will!
- Oh, no, you don't.

388
00:42:59,657 --> 00:43:01,456
We're gonna blast your windows.!

389
00:43:01,595 --> 00:43:04,255
This is my affair.
The lights.

390
00:43:04,398 --> 00:43:06,331
Go upstairs and turn on
all the lights.

391
00:43:06,432 --> 00:43:10,028
They won't be able to see me,
but I'll be able to see them. Go ahead.

392
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,193
No.

393
00:43:12,338 --> 00:43:14,737
No, I won't.

394
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,706
Go.

395
00:43:16,842 --> 00:43:19,208
Goddamn you! Move!

396
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,317
Move!

397
00:43:27,887 --> 00:43:30,787
- Yee-hee-hee-hoo!

398
00:43:30,856 --> 00:43:33,791
Oh, he's running it
into the glass house.!

399
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,555
Norman.!

400
00:43:37,662 --> 00:43:39,597
Charlie.! In the glass house.!

401
00:43:41,733 --> 00:43:44,726
What are you gonna do on your own?

402
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:48,170
Do we have any rope? Huh?

403
00:43:48,273 --> 00:43:51,072
I'm talking to you.
Do we have any rope?

404
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,179
No.

405
00:43:53,278 --> 00:43:55,407
I suggest...

406
00:43:55,548 --> 00:43:57,641
you get out of the way
of the windows.

407
00:43:57,782 --> 00:44:00,617
I also suggest that you turn
the rest of the lights on upstairs.

408
00:44:00,753 --> 00:44:03,586
- Do we have any wire?
- I told you, I won't help you.

409
00:44:03,722 --> 00:44:06,157
I see.

410
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:10,257
Why don't you entertain Niles?

411
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:49,768
Norman! Chris!

412
00:44:50,871 --> 00:44:53,202
Who is it?

413
00:44:54,407 --> 00:44:56,773
Where are ya?

414
00:44:56,909 --> 00:44:58,844
- Yaa-ha!
- Aah!

415
00:44:58,978 --> 00:45:01,675
Oh, I fell!

416
00:45:01,813 --> 00:45:03,715
You're damned right, ya jerk!

417
00:45:03,817 --> 00:45:05,943
I'll wrap this bike
'round your neck!

418
00:45:12,057 --> 00:45:14,117
- See ya at the bottom!
- Yee!

419
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:22,527
Let me in the door.!
I want Niles.!

420
00:45:24,903 --> 00:45:27,338
David, they're everywhere.
What are we gonna do?

421
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:30,875
- David! Aah!
- Amy.

422
00:45:30,943 --> 00:45:34,537
Amy. Amy.

423
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:37,342
Open the door,
and let's have Niles.

424
00:45:38,784 --> 00:45:41,309
I won't let them hurt you.

425
00:45:41,487 --> 00:45:43,387
Please, love.

426
00:45:43,456 --> 00:45:45,923
Wait there.
I'm coming, Charlie.

427
00:45:50,028 --> 00:45:52,293
Wait. Wait, Tom.

428
00:45:53,567 --> 00:45:56,001
No, David!

429
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:02,028
- Easy, Tom. Come on, Tom! Wait a minute.

430
00:46:02,175 --> 00:46:04,143
Let me out, David!

431
00:46:06,845 --> 00:46:08,746
David, I'm sick of it.

432
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:15,246
If you don't let them have
what they want, then I'm going.

433
00:46:17,023 --> 00:46:19,251
Let me go.

434
00:46:23,929 --> 00:46:26,362
Go. Go.

435
00:46:29,802 --> 00:46:31,666
Go on.

436
00:46:38,244 --> 00:46:41,269
No! Aah!

437
00:46:45,985 --> 00:46:48,318
Stay there and do
as you're told.

438
00:46:49,921 --> 00:46:53,380
If you don't,
I'll break your neck.

439
00:46:57,095 --> 00:46:59,827
You've got more cartridges, Tom.
Enough for all of them.!

440
00:46:59,965 --> 00:47:02,456
- It's just Niles.
- Listen-

441
00:47:02,635 --> 00:47:05,126
He can't shoot
through that door.

442
00:47:05,304 --> 00:47:07,170
Ya dirty Yank bastard.!

443
00:47:07,305 --> 00:47:09,639
Listen to me.

444
00:47:09,775 --> 00:47:13,711
You know what happens if they
get in now? They'll kill us all.

445
00:47:19,385 --> 00:47:22,751
They've gone too far
to back down now.

446
00:47:22,889 --> 00:47:25,822
You understand that?

447
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:29,291
We're dead if they get in.

448
00:47:29,394 --> 00:47:32,592
Thank you, sweetheart. Stay.

449
00:47:37,068 --> 00:47:39,059
- Cawsey, come here.!
- Where are ya?

450
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:40,298
- Cawsey, come here.!
- Where are ya?

451
00:47:41,572 --> 00:47:44,804
- Can you get in?
- Yeah, I think so.

452
00:47:44,978 --> 00:47:48,309
They'll be hiding from the gun.
Get in and slip along and open the door.

453
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:51,541
Hey. Make bloody sure
Tom don't fire at me.

454
00:47:51,717 --> 00:47:54,653
He won't. I'll be there.

455
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,119
Mrs. Sumner, I've got
something for you here. Look.

456
00:47:58,224 --> 00:48:01,090
- Aah!

457
00:48:01,193 --> 00:48:04,027
See him down there?

458
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,530
- Get out! Get out!
- Aah.! Hee hee.!

459
00:48:17,175 --> 00:48:19,041
Let go.

460
00:48:21,514 --> 00:48:25,211
Make one move, you son of a bitch,
and I'll slit your throat.

461
00:48:25,351 --> 00:48:28,617
Give me your other hand.

462
00:48:28,755 --> 00:48:30,653
Come on.

463
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:43,429
This wasn't any of my doing, sir.
It was Venner and Hedden.

464
00:48:43,568 --> 00:48:46,059
Been after your wife, yes.

465
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,037
Am I hurting you, Mr. Scutt?

466
00:48:48,139 --> 00:48:50,574
- My neck's on the glass.
- Good.

467
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:53,304
Hope you slit your throat.

468
00:48:57,349 --> 00:49:00,581
- Come out here.!

469
00:49:00,686 --> 00:49:03,211
Amy, come here.

470
00:49:06,626 --> 00:49:09,253
Get me out ofhere.!

471
00:49:10,595 --> 00:49:12,427
Tom.!

472
00:49:14,567 --> 00:49:17,559
- Wait. Fine.
- Watch my head.

473
00:49:21,005 --> 00:49:23,439
Hold it still.
That's it.

474
00:49:25,478 --> 00:49:27,376
Get upstairs.

475
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,615
There we are.

476
00:49:46,898 --> 00:49:49,867
David.! David.! No.!

477
00:49:50,001 --> 00:49:53,268
David.! David.! No.!

478
00:49:53,371 --> 00:49:55,704
No! Aah!

479
00:49:55,809 --> 00:49:59,072
David! No! Aah!

480
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:08,046
Open the attic door. Come on.

481
00:50:08,153 --> 00:50:10,086
Come on.

482
00:50:21,634 --> 00:50:23,568
Tom!

483
00:50:33,644 --> 00:50:37,137
Open the door,
or I'll blow you to pieces.!

484
00:50:37,282 --> 00:50:42,380
- You bastard.
- Okay. Okay, take it easy.

485
00:50:42,487 --> 00:50:46,014
Where is he?
I can't see him.

486
00:50:46,157 --> 00:50:48,059
Open the door.!

487
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:12,014
More water!

488
00:51:19,893 --> 00:51:23,192
Norman, Tom.! Come in here.!

489
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:50,420
- I got him!
- It'll hold. Where's the pole?

490
00:52:03,001 --> 00:52:05,835
Go on. Yell out if you see them
come around the front.

491
00:52:05,938 --> 00:52:08,237
Charlie, come over here.

492
00:52:12,077 --> 00:52:14,478
Here we go again.!

493
00:52:14,581 --> 00:52:16,742
Keep goin; Norman.!
Do it again.!

494
00:52:21,186 --> 00:52:23,916
Hee-hee.!

495
00:52:24,055 --> 00:52:27,322
- Tom!
- To your right a bit.

496
00:52:29,362 --> 00:52:31,555
- Watch this one.

497
00:52:42,641 --> 00:52:44,505
He's playing music.

498
00:53:06,898 --> 00:53:08,831
- Give me the gun.
- Out of the way. I'm goin' in.

499
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:16,137
Keep the gun pointed,
and he won't get near you.

500
00:53:22,347 --> 00:53:24,814
- I've got ya, Tom!

501
00:53:27,286 --> 00:53:30,014
What's the matter, Tom?

502
00:53:41,567 --> 00:53:44,057
You're dead!
I'll kill ya!

503
00:53:44,202 --> 00:53:47,398
Don't come in.
You don't come in here.

504
00:54:08,961 --> 00:54:10,894
Evenin', Mr. Sumner.

505
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:25,503
Come on.!

506
00:54:28,345 --> 00:54:31,077
Come on!

507
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:07,818
Gun's empty.

508
00:55:10,088 --> 00:55:12,956
Is it, now?

509
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,126
Why don't you pull it
and show me?

510
00:55:17,228 --> 00:55:20,595
I've got plenty of time,
Mr. Sumner.

511
00:55:24,001 --> 00:55:26,233
David, I need you.!

512
00:55:26,371 --> 00:55:29,568
Charlie.!

513
00:55:29,708 --> 00:55:31,505
No! Get away!

514
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,907
No.! Aaah.!

515
00:55:42,554 --> 00:55:45,023
No.! No.!

516
00:55:57,068 --> 00:56:01,061
Take him downstairs, Charlie.

517
00:56:01,206 --> 00:56:03,139
You put him to sleep.

518
00:56:03,275 --> 00:56:05,742
I'll call you when I'm ready.

519
00:56:21,092 --> 00:56:23,617
Just do it, Charlie.

520
00:57:08,072 --> 00:57:10,063
No, Charlie!

521
00:58:36,894 --> 00:58:38,795
Jesus.

522
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,664
I got 'em all.

523
00:59:08,193 --> 00:59:10,684
Amy? Get- Get the gun.

524
00:59:10,862 --> 00:59:12,795
Amy-

525
00:59:50,168 --> 00:59:51,465
Use the gun, Amy.

526
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:14,018
Okay. Okay?

527
01:01:45,184 --> 01:01:47,412
You okay?

528
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:55,025
Hmm?

529
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,612
I don't know my way home.

530
01:02:52,282 --> 01:02:54,217
It's okay.

531
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:04,751
I don't either.
