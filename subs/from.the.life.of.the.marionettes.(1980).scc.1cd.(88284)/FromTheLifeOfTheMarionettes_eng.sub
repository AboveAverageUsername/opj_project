{650}{702}l'm tired.
{886}{947}Now you will sleep.
{1719}{1756}No.
{2431}{2469}Come.
{5198}{5294}Twenty hours after the murder,|Mogens Jensen...
{5298}{5393}professor of psychiatry,|speaks to the head of the inquiry.
{5407}{5563}l think it was around five. l had|just got up to get the morning paper.
{5568}{5653}Then the phone rang.|l remember being angry...
{5658}{5737}for having forgotten|to switch the phone off.
{5742}{5885}Because patients tend to call me|at all hours of the day and night.
{5890}{6060}First l ignored it, then l answered|it. l didn't want my wife to wake up.
{6065}{6201}Peter Egermann was on the phone.|He was very calm...
{6206}{6295}he sounded in complete control.|He asked me...
{6300}{6370}to go to a certain address.
{6375}{6461}He told me to enter the house,|cross the courtyard...
{6465}{6550}and look for a metal door|to the left of the stairs.
{6555}{6666}He said he'd found a key and|that he would open the door for me.
{6671}{6782}lt took me 20 minutes to get there.|lt was around 5:30.
{6790}{6892}l opened that door and|went down to the basement.
{6897}{7042}All the rooms were brightly lit,|a tape recorder was blasting.
{7447}{7538}The girl was lying|face down on the table.
{7543}{7610}She was covered|with a brocaded cloth.
{7615}{7676}Her legs were spread wide apart.
{7681}{7808}Her face was covered in blood,|swollen, discoloured.
{7813}{7924}You'll find all the other|details in the autopsy report.
{7929}{8082}Egermann said he had killed the girl,|and then had anal sex with her.
{8143}{8206}To be honest...
{8211}{8311}l am deeply shocked.|l've known Egermann for 20 years.
{8316}{8410}He is an amiable, talented,|conscientious man...
{8415}{8495}whom everyone likes,|as far as l know.
{8500}{8591}He's happily married|to a hardworking career woman.
{8596}{8658}He has a large circle of friends...
{8663}{8737}and leads a comfortable,|rather modest life.
{8742}{8834}A charming mother...|-Cordelia Egermann, the actress.
{8839}{8957}His father died a while ago.|His family is wealthy.
{8962}{9074}His brother is a consul; his sister|is married to a businessman.
{9079}{9180}No hereditary depression in his family?|-Not that l know of.
{9185}{9277}Peter and Katarina|never consulted with you?
{9282}{9369}lt was never serious.|Nothing Valium couldn't cure.
{9380}{9448}Fourteen days|before the catastrophe...
{9452}{9571}Peter Egermann went to see|Prof. Mogens Jensen at his office.
{9636}{9740}There've been many long nights|and too much drinking recently.
{9745}{9878}Besides, l am very aware|of the fact that time is passing.
{9883}{9920}So...
{10030}{10144}But l'll stop being evasive.|l'll tell you what's troubling me.
{10149}{10263}l guess everyone is troubled by|something, don't you think?
{10268}{10343}But my anxiety|is really quite particular.
{10348}{10407}That's why l've come to you.
{10435}{10547}You think l'm long-winded,|that l talk too much. You're right.
{10552}{10648}Perhaps l just hesitate to tell you|what's troubling me.
{10674}{10794}As long as l don't express my anxiety|in words, it remains a dream.
{10799}{10967}Once l've said the words,|my anxiety becomes manifest, a fact.
{11095}{11167}My desire to kill appalls me.
{11235}{11332}My desire to kill another|human being appalls me.
{11358}{11402}lt appalls me.
{11508}{11567}l want to kill my wife.
{11609}{11662}l want to kill her.
{11723}{11842}l've been carrying that idea|around with me for two years.
{11920}{12022}Katarina has been unfaithful,|and so have l. But no matter.
{12027}{12130}We're great in bed.|Actually, our sex life is fantastic.
{12135}{12248}We make love - how should l put it?|Without emotions.
{12253}{12371}l mean, without having to think|about our feelings for each other.
{12423}{12526}l'm not used to describing|the complicated state of the soul.
{12531}{12649}Perhaps l don't need to say that.|l have the feeling you understand.
{12679}{12807}We love our pleasure. Or perhaps|the pleasure the other person feels.
{12841}{12962}Sex was always best after we had|been unfaithful to each other.
{13014}{13090}But the word ''unfaithful''|is the wrong word.
{13095}{13206}lt has a negative moral connotation.|And we never...
{13211}{13292}l guess it's called|''mutual sexual freedom''.
{13332}{13477}Yes, l'm going on and on.|Now you see how helpless l am.
{13512}{13573}Shrinks are interested in dreams.
{13578}{13655}Mine are banal, meaningless, dull.
{13835}{13973}l want you to tell me my hormones are|responsible for my urge to kill her.
{14010}{14081}Maybe l just want you|to hypnotize me.
{14086}{14137}That could be one solution.
{14217}{14309}You're not saying anything.|-Why did you come to see me?
{14314}{14386}You don't believe in your own agony.
{14391}{14479}You don't believe|in the existence of the soul.
{14484}{14547}So why did you come?|-Are you angry?
{14552}{14680}Of course l'm angry. Because you|have so little respect for your fear.
{14706}{14783}Maybe you should prescribe|something for me.
{14788}{14939}Just take a long walk. That's|the best thing for depression.
{14944}{15056}Then drink some coffee, a few|cognacs, and you'll feel good as new.
{15061}{15140}Thank you, Mogens.|You've been a great help.
{15145}{15182}Good-bye.
{15383}{15432}l don't want to.
{15530}{15567}Sit down.
{15632}{15697}l think l've made quite an effort.
{15772}{15857}How often do we say|that we hate someone.
{15862}{15982}Or that we wish our counterpart|were dead. Or we hit each other.
{15987}{16081}Humiliate, challenge,|threaten the other.
{16086}{16207}We spit each other in the face, grip|each other's arms, wrestle, yell.
{16212}{16338}Finally some blood is shed. One of us|triumphs, the other is destroyed...
{16343}{16440}and stands by the bathroom door|asking for forgiveness.
{16466}{16541}That's not dangerous?|-Not dangerous at all.
{16546}{16605}Everything's like a game...
{16610}{16744}with often repeated answers, pauses,|tantrums. The exits are rehearsed.
{16785}{16869}Of course it's fatal|we don't have an audience...
{16874}{16967}but we usually manage|to overcome that inconvenience.
{17006}{17088}That's all...|-That's all nothing.
{17093}{17172}Just part and parcel|of our life together.
{17177}{17212}l think...
{17312}{17367}No, that's not true either.
{17431}{17479}Not true?
{17484}{17588}Doesn't one crazy theory claim|some fools love fighting...
{17593}{17663}and humiliating each other?
{17668}{17773}Don't they say it's|some rarefied form of contact?
{17778}{17896}l get punched in the face. Hurrah,|we finally had physical contact.
{17969}{18027}Divorce and all that.
{18072}{18132}How are you going to kill her?
{18178}{18252}lt's all quiet in the apartment.
{18257}{18319}And intense sunlight floods in.
{18375}{18518}We've been left to our own devices|for several days. Perhaps longer.
{18523}{18590}We haven't quarreled. All is...
{18595}{18719}quiet. Maybe it's early morning.|The street is empty.
{18724}{18796}A feeling of peacefulness|overcomes me.
{18823}{18887}Everything seems very far away.
{18892}{19030}l mean, work, everyday life,|voices and appointments.
{19035}{19107}There's no agitation or fear.
{19186}{19281}l can see her moving|around in the bathroom...
{19286}{19379}saturated in the intense,|almost unreal sunlight.
{19417}{19467}She's combing her hair.
{19493}{19573}l've always loved to watch my wife.
{19578}{19689}Even when we hated each other.|Or when she was revoltingly drunk...
{19694}{19834}sick or just angry.|l've always loved the way she moves.
{19839}{19917}Her scent, her presence.
{19952}{20067}She has turned toward the mirror.|She watches me in the mirror.
{20072}{20174}She is lost in her own thoughts,|but she breathes heavily.
{20179}{20257}l'm standing behind her,|at an angle...
{20262}{20335}and l'm holding the razor|in my right hand.
{20340}{20457}She watches me the whole time.|And now she really sees me.
{20516}{20607}An imperceptible smile|hovers around her lips.
{20679}{20784}l can feel her slight agitation,|a slight pulse at her throat.
{20789}{20902}Did you know that a human body|contains a large amount of blood?
{20907}{21057}lf you cut the jugular vein, you and|the walls would be covered in blood.
{21062}{21126}Blood reeks and is sticky.
{21131}{21263}She wouldn't die right away. lt'd|take a few minutes for her to faint.
{21268}{21354}Both of you would probably have|a lot of time to think.
{21359}{21409}Perhaps you'd regret it.
{21414}{21571}Things would turn out differently.|You wouldn't have your experience...
{21576}{21738}other than seeing Katarina on the|bathroom mat with a severed throat.
{21743}{21820}You're being ironic, aren't you?|-No.
{21854}{21924}l can get you admitted to my clinic.
{21929}{22015}They'll pump you full of drugs|till you don't care...
{22020}{22102}if you're Peter Egermann|or the emperor of China.
{22107}{22246}Don't worry. We're great at|obliterating people's identities.
{22251}{22362}No more self, no more fear.|Fantastic, isn't it?
{22390}{22485}l've read the newest techniques|of psychiatry are tough.
{22490}{22576}l told you that|l'm taking this matter seriously.
{22581}{22705}l'm keeping you from your work.|-Yes, a bit. l'm expecting someone.
{22710}{22846}l won't waste any more of your time.|-l'd have time for you on Thursday.
{22851}{22908}After four.|-You're very kind.
{22913}{22979}Aren't l?|-Should l tell Katarina...
{22984}{23094}Goodbye, Peter Egermann.|Take care of yourself.
{23099}{23144}Bye, Mogens.
{23198}{23252}And take good care of yourself.
{23257}{23359}What do you mean by that?|-Your guest is waiting.
{23364}{23403}Do you know the way out?
{23446}{23483}Of course.
{24246}{24336}Mrs Egermann? ls Mrs Egermann in?
{24341}{24389}Yes, it's very urgent.
{24415}{24468}Professor Jensen.
{24473}{24546}Yes, that'd be better. l'll hold.
{24555}{24612}Katarina?
{24617}{24672}Peter was just here.
{24677}{24740}No, he just left.
{24745}{24842}Could you come here?|l'll leave the door open, OK?
{24880}{24917}Yes.
{25128}{25267}Sorry that l'm late. l had to park|farther down the street so that...
{25272}{25362}Then l ran the last little bit.|lt's really cold out.
{25391}{25466}How are you?|Let me look at you.
{25471}{25592}You look very well. Have you got|anything drinkable around here?
{25627}{25725}How's the fashion show going?|-lt'll be great. You coming?
{25730}{25874}Fanny's going. l can't. l've got|to stay home and work on a speech.
{25879}{25941}You're going to Tunisia?|-On Friday.
{25946}{25990}For how long?|-Six weeks.
{25995}{26057}Alone?|-Of course.
{26134}{26190}This wine is wonderful.
{26195}{26236}What about your wife?
{26241}{26325}We go on vacation separately.|-So you've told me.
{26330}{26386}Why don't you join me?|-To Tunisia?
{26391}{26448}Why not?|-What about Peter?
{26453}{26540}He'd probably consider it|a practical idea.
{26545}{26635}Why hasn't a clever man like you|realized that l love Peter?
{26640}{26701}Haven't you ever...|-Often.
{26706}{26809}Much too often. But that's different.|-l don't understand.
{26814}{26921}You don't need to understand.|-But now l'm curious.
{26926}{26985}l find you attractive.
{26990}{27092}l think it'd be a lot of fun|to have an affair with you.
{27128}{27178}But a trip's a different thing.
{27205}{27247}And now?
{27252}{27369}l didn't come here to sleep with you,|but to talk about Peter.
{27374}{27469}Besides, l have my period.|-Those are two poor excuses.
{27567}{27662}At any rate, we can't stay here.|-We can't stay here.
{27667}{27712}So what do you suggest?
{27747}{27834}ln there.|-lt's not the first time, is it?
{27839}{27958}l'm sworn to professional secrecy.|-Where's the bathroom?
{28158}{28195}Here you go.
{29487}{29555}l'm sorry, but l can't go|through with it.
{29598}{29686}We'd probably have|a lot of fun, but l can't.
{29716}{29808}Because of Peter?|-Yes, because of Peter.
{29813}{29853}How touching.
{29875}{29977}Why the irony?|-l wasn't being ironic. l swear.
{30236}{30382}Peter wanted to talk to me. He claims|he's obsessed by a certain idea.
{30387}{30480}Obsessed by an idea?|-A recurring thought.
{30485}{30525}ls it serious?
{30530}{30641}People inflate their anxieties.|They're afraid, and the fear...
{30646}{30744}is worse than their obsessions.|-What kind of obsessions?
{30749}{30856}Death wishes, suicide, murder,|violent acts, violence.
{30861}{30989}l'm not sure. He's coming back|on Thursday. l'll find out more then.
{30994}{31072}Could he...|-l don't think it's that serious.
{31098}{31140}And what can l do?
{31171}{31301}Maybe you should go away for a while.|-At the busiest time of the year?
{31306}{31409}And why should l?|lf Peter's really sick, he needs me.
{31414}{31579}There's a small but definite|possibility that you could get hurt.
{31584}{31665}What do you mean? Would Peter...|-Yes.
{31691}{31782}Did he say that...|-He made allusions to that effect.
{31842}{31903}That seems totally ridiculous.
{31908}{32008}So you won't take a trip?|-lmpossible. Please understand.
{32013}{32132}How about taking in a house guest?|-Peter wouldn't tolerate that.
{32137}{32267}You have two nephews, don't you?|-A 6 and an 8-year-old? lmpossible.
{32310}{32366}What if Peter took a trip?|-He's busy.
{32371}{32454}They're negotiating|some complicated deals.
{32459}{32524}He can take sick leave|for a few months.
{32529}{32589}That's totally unrealistic.
{32594}{32674}Well, then l'm stumped.
{32726}{32799}l wonder if you're|not more worried...
{32804}{32839}than you say you are.
{32844}{32933}Rationally speaking,|the risks are pretty minimal.
{32938}{33003}Then let's remain rational.
{33008}{33120}l don't know, Katarina. My damn|intuition won't let go of this.
{33155}{33225}ls your intuition always right?
{33230}{33267}l think so.
{33301}{33374}l also have an intuition.
{33379}{33440}And what's it telling you?
{33445}{33519}That consciously or unconsciously...
{33524}{33641}you are trying to figure out|Peter's and my relationship.
{33646}{33742}For what reason?|-l don't know.
{33771}{33845}Maybe it's just the|kind of person you are.
{33871}{34004}Now l'm flabbergasted.|-l've always been afraid of you.
{34009}{34093}Surely not only afraid?|-Peter's a part of me.
{34098}{34160}Don't you understand that?
{34165}{34259}l carry him inside of me,|no matter where l go.
{34264}{34297}He's inside of me.
{34302}{34388}l've never felt like that|with anyone else.
{34393}{34485}lf we had kids, it'd be different.|He's my child, l'm his.
{34490}{34554}No, that's not true.
{34559}{34650}We both don't want|to be clever or mature.
{34655}{34752}That's why we fight|and hit each other and cry.
{34757}{34812}We don't want to grow up.
{34852}{34932}But we share the same|blood circulation.
{34962}{35077}Our nerves have grown together|in some strange, uncanny way.
{35103}{35158}Can you understand that?
{35187}{35300}Whenever Peter's not feeling well,|the same happens to me.
{35305}{35412}l want to run home to Peter|and hold him and say, ''Now...
{35461}{35574}From now on, l'll understand|everything you say or think...
{35579}{35627}everything you feel.''
{35672}{35737}l want to hold him fast|until he finds me.
{35742}{35857}Why the hell don't we see each other,|although we live together...
{35862}{35903}and know each other well.
{35912}{35963}A week after the murder...
{35967}{36096}the head of the police inquiry|has a talk with Peter's mother.
{36212}{36267}l feel so helpless.
{36294}{36340}What do you want to know?
{36345}{36421}l'd be grateful for anything|you can tell me.
{36521}{36584}Peter was the child|l'd always wanted.
{36589}{36636}We were so happy.
{36662}{36787}He had a wonderful childhood. Maybe|it was too sheltered, l don't know.
{36813}{36916}He was a fearful child.|He was afraid of the dark.
{36921}{37012}He always wanted the light|in the hall to be left on.
{37017}{37138}He was afraid of all sorts of things:|dogs, horses, large birds.
{37143}{37271}His siblings were much more robust.|He was more like me.
{37276}{37399}l was also a sensitive child.|And somewhat sickly.
{37404}{37494}l had asthma and would get|sudden allergy attacks.
{37520}{37652}l remember he used to bite|his fingernails. lt looked awful.
{37684}{37783}He was very close to his sister|who was three years younger.
{37788}{37899}They'd play with dolls|and put on puppet shows.
{37932}{38063}He was a quick learner at school.|He always got the highest grades.
{38068}{38147}He was much more talented|than his siblings.
{38252}{38360}When he was twenty,|he met a very nice girl.
{38365}{38487}They got engaged and planned to get|married after finishing college.
{38492}{38617}And then he met Katarina|and fell madly in love with her.
{38640}{38739}Katarina had a lot of control|over him. She had the say.
{38765}{38881}What Peter's parents|said or thought...
{38886}{38952}wasn't important anymore.
{39009}{39092}Maybe that's the way|it's supposed to be.
{39159}{39272}l don't know anything.|l don't understand anything.
{39334}{39407}And how could l understand?
{39523}{39641}l was an actress before l married. l|gave it up to look after my children.
{39646}{39771}My husband didn't want me to continue|working. And l've never regretted it.
{39776}{39918}l've had a good and happy life.
{39984}{40040}Peter came to see me a few days ago.
{40045}{40189}lt was a brief visit. He had a list|of things that needed to be repaired.
{40194}{40322}We went through the list together.|He was to speak with the architect.
{40341}{40433}lt's an old, dilapidated house...
{40438}{40506}with a somewhat unkept garden.
{40511}{40643}ln one wing, the roof is so badly|insulated that snow seeps through it.
{40648}{40782}We talked about all these things.|We were both in a bit of a rush.
{40787}{40920}l was expecting guests for dinner,|and Peter was going to a conference.
{40925}{41045}l didn't notice anything unusual.|Peter just said he was a bit tired.
{41050}{41138}That he'd had a cold.|Katarina was to be in Paris...
{41143}{41212}till the middle of the week.
{41232}{41366}We laughed about all those repairs|and the architect's report.
{41371}{41501}lt was really quite funny. Peter said|that l live in a real rat trap.
{41506}{41597}But l love my old house.
{41602}{41682}l'll never move out of it.
{41882}{41953}Five days before the catastrophe...
{41957}{42021}Katarina and Peter|spend a sleepless night.
{42291}{42457}Go ahead and turn on the light if you|want to read. lt won't bother me.
{42483}{42562}l think l'll just get up for a while.
{42567}{42668}Shall l make you some hot milk?|-No, thank you.
{42735}{42847}Shall we turn up the heat?|-Not for me.
{42983}{43033}How's your cold?
{43125}{43224}l don't have a sore throat anymore.|-Oh, good.
{45941}{45987}l can't sleep either.
{46013}{46129}Probably because of the change|in weather or the full moon.
{46134}{46261}Or that horrible meal|Oscar insisted on making for us.
{46266}{46325}What are you drinking?|-Cognac.
{46330}{46446}l'll have something to drink, too.|-Your awful liqueur is to your left.
{46451}{46575}Are you nuts? A liqueur at three in|the morning? l'll have some whisky.
{46580}{46679}That'll relax me. And it's healthy.|-Don't drink so much.
{46684}{46814}l'll drink as much as l want,|my darling. l never go overboard.
{46819}{46903}You were pretty|insufferable last night.
{46908}{46968}Don't l know it.
{46973}{47058}You'd had too much to drink.|That's why.
{47063}{47161}l was like that on purpose.|-That's the way it is. On purpose.
{47166}{47287}l enjoy embarrassing Martin.|-You succeeded wonderfully.
{47318}{47400}He always tries|to fondle me in secret.
{47405}{47531}So l get tipsy|and fondle him. Openly.
{47536}{47637}That's a subtle way of getting back|at someone, little Peter.
{47642}{47769}You start talking nonsense loudly...|-That's your opinion.
{47774}{47846}Everyone else thinks|l'm terribly nice.
{47953}{48064}Screw all those dinner parties.|-We've got five next week.
{48069}{48131}So you actually enjoy them?|-So do you.
{48136}{48173}Not anymore.
{48178}{48252}We're having dinner|at your mom's tomorrow.
{48257}{48312}That's important.|-Not to me.
{48317}{48410}lt's a business dinner.|-l don't have time.
{48415}{48467}Katarina, you promised.
{48472}{48554}Your business friends|consider it an honour...
{48559}{48645}to eat that grub|your awful old mother prepares.
{48650}{48726}And in that rat trap to boot.|lt's incredible.
{48731}{48827}Mama is a monument.|-She's a rotten old monument...
{48832}{48927}to your father's|ancient imperium of oppression.
{48988}{49110}Now Katarina's going to bed. l have|to get up at a quarter to seven.
{49115}{49188}l'll lie down in the study.
{49193}{49293}Don't you have tennis tomorrow?|-Harry's arm hurts.
{49298}{49384}He smokes too much.|-His smoking's beside the point.
{49389}{49509}Smoking 70 cigarettes a day affects|the circulation and muscle tissue.
{49514}{49589}Yeah, right.|-lt goes without saying.
{49594}{49682}lt goes without saying|that it goes without saying.
{49731}{49811}So you don't want me|to wake you before l go?
{49816}{49888}When are you going?|-Shortly before eight.
{49893}{49992}Then wake me shortly before eight.|-Good night, darling.
{50018}{50051}Good night, dear.
{50118}{50155}Peter?
{50244}{50282}Yes?
{50287}{50358}Can't you tell me|why you're so unhappy?
{50375}{50509}l'm neither unhappy nor happy.|What a crappy word by the way.
{50514}{50590}Are you having problems?|-On the contrary.
{50595}{50690}Business is booming.|lf that's what you mean.
{50695}{50762}No, that's not what l meant.
{50830}{50892}There's no way out.
{50953}{51019}lf you understand what l mean.
{51024}{51070}No.|-No...
{51096}{51193}You have to give me an example.|-Surfeit.
{51198}{51284}Surfeit?|l don't even know what that is.
{51289}{51387}A typical component of ''surfeit''...
{51392}{51499}is that you feel|unbearably surfeited...
{51504}{51617}when asked to elucidate the reason|for that state of surfeit.
{51655}{51757}Now l'll tell you what l actually|didn't intend to tell you.
{51762}{51812}No, it's nothing special.
{51838}{51922}Just a feeling.|-OK...
{51936}{52015}lt happened early yesterday morning.
{52020}{52155}l was in the bathroom, drying myself|with a freshly washed, rough towel...
{52160}{52207}that smelled good.
{52259}{52377}Suddenly l had an insight,|or whatever it's called.
{52403}{52517}l saw all these familiar things|around me and knew...
{52522}{52609}that they soon wouldn't|belong to me anymore.
{52638}{52712}That everything would be|taken away from me.
{52755}{52847}None of the things around me|would belong to me anymore.
{52911}{53027}That feeling was gone after a minute|or so, but last night it came back.
{53032}{53107}l'm tired, Katarina.
{53163}{53261}Do you think you can go to sleep now?|-l took a Nembutal.
{53379}{53455}Come. Let's go to bed.
{53671}{53752}What time is it?|-Almost four.
{53842}{53927}Now l can hear the transport|trucks on the highway.
{54387}{54511}We have two alternatives. Either|we carry the investment costs...
{54516}{54633}raising the license fee in accordance|with the usual interest rate...
{54638}{54712}while taking the|amortization into account.
{54748}{54858}Or if the other party|carries the investment costs...
{54863}{54936}the first alternative|seems preferable.
{54962}{55105}New paragraph. We agreed on|an amortization period of 7 years.
{55131}{55304}lt's a long time, but in return all|repairs would be free of charge...
{55309}{55439}dash, that way we could gradually|exchange all used parts over time...
{55444}{55492}dash...
{55497}{55582}which would be advantageous|to us in the long run.
{55587}{55642}New paragraph.
{55734}{55772}So, new paragraph.
{55777}{55901}While choosing between a fixed|license fee per machine per year...
{55906}{56016}or one based on production volume|with a guaranteed minimum fee...
{56021}{56099}we agreed on the first alternative.
{56104}{56184}They obviously think|we'd audit their books...
{56189}{56279}and find out their actual|production figures...
{56284}{56361}No, write|when auditing their books...
{56366}{56425}we'd obtain certain information...
{56430}{56582}which we would use when setting up|offices in the countries in question.
{56631}{56728}The problem is that a completely|new point was then raised.
{56733}{56843}l protested by saying that that point|had been raised much too late.
{56848}{56967}But in fact, they're right. lt'll|be difficult to dismiss their demand.
{56985}{57140}New paragraph. They said that, as|they had decided on Alternative 1 ...
{57145}{57249}the license fee would pay|off the equipment in 7 years.
{57254}{57387}The first extension of the agreement|covers a period of 7 1/2 years...
{57392}{57485}a further prolongation|would extend it to 10 years.
{57490}{57573}As the equipment,|which remains our property...
{57578}{57691}is amortized at the end|of the first prolongation period...
{57696}{57822}they are of the opinion the license|fee should be reduced after 7 years.
{57827}{57919}New paragraph. They are|of course right in the long run.
{57924}{58060}Which means that we have to tell them|how much the equipment costs.
{58065}{58191}ln our calculations of the two|alternatives, we assumed correctly...
{58196}{58363}they would choose Alternative 1 .|So we overstated the costs.
{58368}{58408}Which means that...
{58413}{58526}if we are to deduct those costs from|the license fees after 7 years...
{58531}{58613}our income would be less|than we had calculated.
{58618}{58709}All board members get a copy,|the archive...
{58714}{58808}you and l, and the main file.|That'll be all, Mrs Anders.
{58818}{58908}Would you like some coffee?|-No, thank you.
{58963}{59057}Can l get off at five tomorrow?|-Of course.
{59106}{59160}Are you all right?
{59165}{59230}l'm fine, thank you.
{59235}{59333}Your mother called.|l told her you were in a meeting.
{59338}{59435}Excellent.|-She wanted to remind of your date.
{60214}{60280}Four days before the catastrophe,|Katarina prepares her fashion show.
{60285}{60364}This is the way l want it.|So change it, Tim.
{60369}{60425}No problem.|Have you called Milan?
{60430}{60510}l called Ariadna today.|Have you talked to Paul?
{60515}{60593}Yes, ten minutes ago.|He's at airport customs.
{60598}{60718}No one's seen our machine.|-Don't send them any money.
{60723}{60850}ls it time to go? Did you have to|wait long? lt's total chaos in here.
{60855}{60945}25 % of the collection|didn't arrive. lmagine that.
{60950}{61023}You're leaving?|-We've got a lunch date.
{61028}{61071}We're running late.
{61076}{61184}l'll be back as soon as possible.|Take care, darling. Let's go.
{61328}{61402}l need a drink.|-We're late as it is.
{61407}{61488}l need a drink.|-You'll get one when we get there.
{61493}{61588}l need a strong drink|to be able to stomach your mother.
{61593}{61670}Let's go to a bar.|lt'll just take two minutes.
{61776}{61871}Can l get a refill, Jack?|l bet you're terribly irritated.
{61876}{62016}l'm terribly irritated.|-lt suits you. Your eyes are darker.
{62021}{62066}l like you when...|-l'm tired.
{62071}{62181}You accepted this luncheon date.|-But l asked you first.
{62186}{62299}No, after you'd already accepted it.|-You know how important it is.
{62304}{62429}You can get as angry as you like,|but l need another drink. Jack...
{62434}{62498}Then l'll tell Mama|you had no time.
{62503}{62555}An excellent idea.
{62917}{62994}Can l get you anything else?|-No, thank you.
{63242}{63353}You didn't go to Peter's|mother's luncheon?
{63358}{63452}How's it going up there?|-We're taking a break till four.
{63457}{63562}l hope you don't mind.|-l don't mind.
{63694}{63774}Have you had anything to eat?|-l don't think so.
{63779}{63877}l have a wonderful idea.|Come to my place for a few hours.
{63882}{63969}You can take a nice long bath,|and l'll make us a salad.
{63974}{64039}l'm fine where l am.|-Come on, Katarina.
{64044}{64107}You need to get out for a bit.
{64126}{64179}l feel so bad.|-Because of Peter?
{64184}{64297}That's so stupid, isn't it?|-Come on, Katarina.
{64371}{64511}Martin was truly a decent person.|We were very attached to each other.
{64515}{64673}But as you know,|fidelity doesn't exist.
{64678}{64746}Not true fidelity.
{64751}{64832}When you're gay,|you can't be faithful.
{64837}{64938}lt's because of the sad fact|that we can't have any children.
{64943}{65043}We can't even adopt any.|-Peter and l are also childless.
{65048}{65195}l've always loved children. l think|l would have been a good mother.
{65200}{65269}Don't you agree?|-Yes.
{65297}{65394}Martin fell madly|in love with a schoolboy.
{65399}{65524}His parents were at the end of their|tether. lt was almost scandalous.
{65529}{65700}Well, naturally l felt rather|abandoned and mourned my loss.
{65705}{65805}But l got this apartment|as a consolation prize.
{65810}{65892}Martin would come here often.
{65897}{66003}He'd sit in the very armchair|in which you're sitting.
{66008}{66074}Sometimes he'd cry.
{66079}{66177}lt was hard. Those were hard times.
{66236}{66316}That boy turned out|to be a real devil.
{66342}{66429}But it's a lovely apartment.|lt really is.
{66434}{66483}lt's very lovely.
{66552}{66658}lt's nice to be with you.|-How long have we known each other?
{66663}{66737}For 15 years, Tim.|-Oh, my God.
{66742}{66849}And we've been working|together for 12 years.
{66854}{66949}Are you unhappy?|-Do l look unhappy?
{66954}{67052}You're always so friendly|and hardworking...
{67057}{67117}and self-possessed.
{67122}{67223}l suddenly had the feeling|that you were terribly unhappy.
{67228}{67324}l'm sorry, Katarina.|l didn't mean to embarrass you.
{67329}{67420}Maybe l want to cry.|-You have to cry if you feel like it.
{67425}{67593}l don't mind at all. On the contrary.|l'd consider it a gesture of trust.
{67620}{67680}Most gay men like women.
{67685}{67795}Not because we're particularly|feminine ourselves. No.
{67800}{67927}But because we're more|in touch with our feelings.
{67932}{68046}l didn't come up with that. Martin|said that. But it could be true.
{68051}{68160}lt's immeasurable grief.|Can you understand that? l've ever...
{68194}{68297}Maybe it isn't grief at all|but some sort of madness.
{68323}{68416}People like me have never given|the soul much thought.
{68421}{68530}Then the soul starts acting up,|and you're helpless. You know?
{68535}{68582}l understand.
{68604}{68752}Perhaps a few tears are shed|at first. A strange kind of crying...
{68784}{68939}which then turns into a terrible|howl of grief and hopelessness.
{68944}{69013}Then it turns into a blind roar.
{69039}{69081}A roar, a roar.
{69089}{69167}Everybody breaks down|once in a while.
{69198}{69282}l've had a couple|of nervous breakdowns myself.
{69287}{69412}l'm not sure if l'm sorry|that l broke down. l don't think so.
{69417}{69484}Love was usually at the root of it.
{69489}{69606}l'm pathologically addicted to|intimacy. And does intimacy exist?
{69611}{69720}When l say intimacy,|l mean intimacy.
{69746}{69865}lt's always the same sad story.|The body itself becomes an obstacle.
{69870}{69918}Then the soul.
{69923}{70081}Soon you're in a muddle of hopes,|fantasies and compromises.
{70086}{70139}My God, l'm so theoretical.
{70189}{70260}l've got a present for you.|-A present?
{70265}{70337}Wait. You'll get it in a minute.
{70342}{70409}Here you go.|-But my dear Katarina...
{70414}{70544}Actually l brought it for Peter, but|he was bad, so now he won't get it.
{70549}{70613}lt's lovely.|-l bought it in Milan.
{70618}{70722}l think it'll look good on you.|l've noticed you wear that color.
{70727}{70764}You see?
{70831}{70928}Does it make me look older?|-You don't want to get old?
{70933}{71072}The wrinkles aren't that bad.|lt's the ugliness that distresses me.
{71077}{71212}The dry skin that's so rough, even|though l put cream on it every night.
{71256}{71373}And this deep furrow|around the mouth.
{71378}{71478}One day l woke up|and looked in the mirror.
{71483}{71548}And there it was. Quite suddenly.
{71553}{71626}l had the feeling|l'd had a heart attack.
{71631}{71732}My neck is still fine. No major|catastrophes around the eyes.
{71737}{71832}But my hands are a disaster.|l've asked three doctors...
{71837}{72006}what to do. They could remove these|spots, but not the veins and wrinkles.
{72061}{72159}l look at my mouth and my hands...
{72164}{72239}and l don't believe my eyes.
{72244}{72361}l'm still a child. Or perhaps|l'm not a child anymore after all.
{72366}{72453}l don't understand|all this business about time.
{72458}{72582}Some experts say it doesn't exist.|And they're right.
{72587}{72693}When l close my eyes,|l feel like a ten-year-old.
{72698}{72802}Even physically.|Then l open my eyes again...
{72833}{72887}and look in the mirror...
{72923}{72977}and there l see this old fogey.
{73005}{73119}A childlike old fogey.|lsn't that weird?
{73124}{73207}A childlike old fogey. That's all.
{73244}{73320}No, there's something else.
{73434}{73484}What is it, Tim?
{73619}{73703}You turn into this.|-l don't understand.
{73708}{73767}You just turn into this.
{74040}{74127}That whole business|about intimacy is just a dream.
{74303}{74377}Brutality and obscenity.
{74423}{74528}Sometimes l go to certain places|to pick up these awful men.
{74533}{74592}You wouldn't believe your eyes.
{74618}{74706}Pleasure and sexuality|and horror and obscenity.
{74711}{74839}All rolled into one. That's the|kind of sex life your old fogey has.
{74844}{74931}You can't exactly|call that tender intimacy.
{74936}{75049}One day someone will kill me. But|that too is a titillating thought.
{75097}{75196}Certain powers drive me|that l can't control.
{75201}{75305}Doctors, lovers...
{75310}{75421}pills, drugs...
{75426}{75527}alcohol, work.
{75565}{75620}Nothing helps.
{75651}{75822}They're secret powers.|Do they have a name? l don't know.
{75886}{75997}Maybe it's the aging process itself.|The putrefaction.
{76002}{76049}l don't know.
{76067}{76147}l have no control over those powers.
{76202}{76308}l get closer to the mirror|and look into my face...
{76313}{76384}that has become so familiar.
{76389}{76504}And l come to the conclusion|that this blend of flesh and blood...
{76509}{76652}and nerves and pieces of bone|contains two totally incompatible...
{76699}{76783}l don't know what to call it.
{76788}{76872}Two incompatible people.
{76903}{77039}The dream of intimacy,|of tenderness, common interests...
{77044}{77154}of the ability to forget yourself|and of all that is alive.
{77159}{77302}And on the other hand, the violence,|the obscenity, the horror and death.
{77353}{77507}Sometimes l think they all stem|from one and the same origin.
{77573}{77617}l don't know.
{77658}{77732}And how could l know anyway?
{77804}{77902}Perhaps my dreams were|just a bit too beautiful.
{77907}{77968}And as a punishment...
{77994}{78094}Life punishes you|when you least expect it.
{78099}{78196}When you get your orgasm,|your nose is so deep in shit...
{78201}{78267}that you almost suffocate.
{78575}{78617}Look at me.
{78776}{78852}Do me a favour and hold my hand.
{78903}{78974}Lay it lightly against your cheek.
{79130}{79174}Can you feel my hand?
{79279}{79347}Can you feel that it's me?
{79374}{79419}That it's me?
{79602}{79731}Three days after the murder,|the head of inquiry speaks to Tim.
{80052}{80131}Please state your full name.
{80136}{80168}Tim. T-l-M.
{80173}{80265}That's your stage name.|Your initials, or whatever.
{80270}{80360}We'd like to know your full name.|-My name is Tim.
{80365}{80489}Everyone in Europe calls me Tim.|-According to my files, your name...
{80494}{80605}is Tomas lsidor Mandelbaum.|-lf you know my name, why ask?
{80610}{80745}lt's a routine question. We have|to ask so that there's no mix-up.
{80750}{80782}That's impossible.
{80799}{80922}This is an informal conversation.|-Then turn off the tape recorder.
{80927}{81023}Does it bother you?|-Obviously. Or l wouldn't have asked.
{81039}{81108}Now it's turned off.|-Thank you very much.
{81139}{81220}Would you like some coffee?|Wine or a cigarette?
{81225}{81302}No, thank you.|-Maybe some mineral water? Tea?
{81307}{81365}We don't have too much to offer you.
{81370}{81411}No, thank you.
{81429}{81546}Then let's get started, Mr Tim.|-Fine.
{81551}{81657}This won't hurt. l promise you.|-l don't believe that either.
{81721}{81826}l asked to speak with you, because|you're a friend of the family.
{81831}{81933}l've worked closely with Katarina|for 10 years. No, 12 years.
{81938}{82042}We've been friends for 10 years.|lnitially we were employees.
{82047}{82109}You know Peter Egermann?|-Of course.
{82114}{82189}What was their marriage like?|-Good.
{82217}{82299}Peter's mother was|of a different opinion.
{82304}{82387}Now you have two|conflicting opinions.
{82392}{82452}Did you have an affair with Peter?
{82484}{82521}No.
{82565}{82636}You seem hesitant.|-We never had an affair.
{82641}{82771}We never touched each other. Perhaps|we embraced the way good friends...
{82776}{82843}embrace.|-Please excuse my bluntness.
{82848}{82891}l'm used to that.
{82902}{82974}Did you know the murdered girl?|-Yes.
{82979}{83011}How well?
{83016}{83153}We were good friends.|-Why were you friends with a whore?
{83158}{83242}What kind of question|is that, lnspector?
{83247}{83341}lt's either malicious,|underhanded or naive.
{83346}{83447}So l'm answering your question|by saying l don't like it.
{83452}{83501}l didn't mean to insult you.
{83506}{83552}l'll try to believe that.
{83600}{83638}Do you live alone?
{83664}{83727}Yes, l do. l live alone.
{83752}{83830}Your girlfriend|introduced you to other men?
{83835}{83959}On occasion.|-You introduced Peter to Ms Krafft...
{83964}{84026}or ''Ka'', as she was called?|-Yes.
{84031}{84158}How did it happen?|-lt happened one Sunday last fall.
{84163}{84231}At the train station.|-You were taking a trip?
{84236}{84384}There are foreign men at the station|who go there to earn a bit of money.
{84389}{84503}Suddenly l ran into Peter Egermann.|He'd bought some foreign papers...
{84508}{84624}at the international newsstand.|We had a cup...
{84629}{84717}of coffee together.|For some reason...
{84722}{84790}l told him why l was at the station.
{84795}{84902}Peter was interested somehow.|Suddenly he told me...
{84907}{84994}that he'd never gone|to a prostitute before.
{84999}{85100}l recommended Katarina Krafft,|gave him her address...
{85105}{85208}and promised to talk to her about it.|That's the whole story.
{85235}{85350}That's the reality. But|actually it's not even half of it.
{85355}{85414}l was furious at Katarina Egermann.
{85419}{85563}Fact is, l've always been furious|with her, even though l liked her.
{85568}{85681}l liked the idea that Peter was|cheating on her with a prostitute.
{85686}{85762}But that's only part of the truth.
{85767}{85911}Weak people choose strange paths.|You should know that, lnspector.
{85916}{86048}lt torments me that l was the one who|introduced the killer to the victim.
{86053}{86194}Please excuse my dramatic turns of|phrase. l just have a bad conscience.
{86199}{86281}l blame my homosexuality.
{86286}{86345}That too is just part of the truth.
{86354}{86459}This is starting to become|interesting, don't you think?
{86886}{86996}The truth is of course that|l wanted Peter all to myself.
{87001}{87074}But that wasn't clear to me.
{87079}{87152}We were to have a mutual secret.
{87206}{87349}l slowly wanted to take him away|from his wife and make him mine.
{87354}{87457}l saw that terrible coldness|in his marriage...
{87462}{87596}and was somewhat obsessed with|the idea that he would turn to me.
{87601}{87686}That he would|discover me at long last.
{87691}{87834}That he would realize|that l secretly loved him.
{87839}{87951}Emotionally,|Peter was a dying man.
{87956}{88042}The way one can die of hunger,|thirst or loss of blood.
{88095}{88155}l knew that l could save him.
{88181}{88248}And l wished l was|the one he was seeking.
{88274}{88332}Seeking to be close to me.
{88507}{88576}l don't think l'm wrong.
{88581}{88681}People like me have|a feeling for such things.
{88686}{88804}Perhaps everything|l've told you isn't the truth either.
{88809}{88903}There are certain clever people|who say we're blind.
{88908}{89028}That our movements are preordained.|That we've been pledged...
{89033}{89094}or violated since birth.
{89157}{89268}But that doesn't make|the slightest difference.
{89273}{89307}Don't you agree?
{89325}{89458}Peter Egermann wrote a letter to|Professor Jensen. lt was never sent.
{89462}{89515}Dear Mogens...
{89520}{89619}what l'm going to describe|isn't a dream in the usual sense.
{89624}{89775}Although l experienced this under|the influence of pills and alcohol.
{89780}{89867}This experience seemed|more real and horrible...
{89872}{90033}than the banal reality of everyday|life. But that's all trivial.
{90038}{90094}You can throw this letter away.
{90099}{90199}l'm not writing to amuse you,|but because l must write.
{90225}{90284}l dreamed that l was sleeping.
{90332}{90405}l dreamed that l was dreaming.
{90463}{90520}lt was very sensual.
{90546}{90635}l mean, in another respect.|Not only erotic.
{90661}{90802}But somehow there was a direct|link between my lower body...
{90830}{90942}and the intense and sweet-smelling|moisture of a woman.
{90970}{91028}Sweat...
{91033}{91083}saliva...
{91088}{91162}the fresh scent of thick hair.
{91221}{91392}l moved over a glittering, spacious|surface with my eyes closed.
{91436}{91496}And all was very quiet.
{91557}{91612}My contentment was complete.
{91617}{91727}l felt a strange urge|to tell a funny story.
{91732}{91797}But l couldn't speak.
{91802}{91856}But that didn't distress me.
{91861}{91988}The feeling of hovering was closely|connected to my muteness...
{91993}{92086}and my brain was intensely|focused on my hands...
{92091}{92168}or rather my fingertips.
{92230}{92322}There was a little eye|on every finger...
{92364}{92534}that perceived this glittering|whiteness with twinkling delight.
{92618}{92673}lt felt good like this.
{92748}{92802}lt could remain this way.
{92919}{92956}l thought...
{93023}{93179}or rather l didn't think at all. lt|flowed like a ribbon across my lips:
{93208}{93344}''lf you are death,|then l welcome you, dear death.
{93395}{93452}lf you are life...
{93480}{93542}then l welcome you, dear life.''
{93634}{93737}l am in a closed room|without windows or doors...
{93742}{93798}but also without a roof or walls.
{93803}{93886}Perhaps l'm locked|in a sphere or an ellipse.
{93891}{94035}l'm not sure. lt didn't occur to me|to examine the contours of the room.
{94040}{94185}l dreamt that l woke|from a deep slumber.
{94190}{94291}l was lying on the floor,|which was as soft as a thick carpet.
{94296}{94374}lt was nice and warm,|and l was content.
{94420}{94564}Katarina lay beside me.|She was still immobile, fast asleep.
{94569}{94662}l knew right away|that it was all a dream.
{94679}{94783}l told myself in a low voice|that l shouldn't be afraid...
{94788}{94866}that it was dangerous|to become afraid...
{94871}{94984}to start panicking,|to try to find a way out...
{94989}{95094}to cry or shout or pound the walls.
{95127}{95200}l decided to remain calm.
{95253}{95343}Katarina started waking up slowly.
{95369}{95423}l tried to talk to her...
{95479}{95551}but l couldn't reach her.
{95556}{95642}lt seemed as though|she didn't know l was there.
{95668}{95821}She was soft and indifferent|in a sexually arousing way.
{95826}{95888}l wanted to make love to her...
{95893}{95992}but she eluded me.|l never managed to penetrate her.
{96029}{96114}She watched me,|her lids half-closed, and smiled.
{96119}{96233}l fell blind rage. l withdrew|to stop myself from killing her.
{96238}{96334}The feelings of rage and horror|almost suffocated me.
{96339}{96391}l told myself to remain calm...
{96396}{96459}unafraid...
{96464}{96544}self-possessed, not unpredictable.
{96603}{96662}Everything went awry.
{97880}{97971}There was even a moment|of tenderness...
{97976}{98032}of complete silence.
{98072}{98162}lt is difficult to describe|that particular moment.
{98199}{98271}The very air l was in|was transformed.
{98276}{98367}lt became milder|and easier to breathe.
{98372}{98454}The grey light vanished...
{98459}{98591}and was replaced by the soft,|subdued light of dawn...
{98596}{98716}much like gentle hands|that caressed our sore bodies.
{98721}{98867}We entered into a sudden|spirituality without reservations.
{98948}{99009}Then disaster struck.
{99049}{99185}The most unimaginable,|irrevocable thing had happened.
{99252}{99317}Katarina was suddenly dead.
{99343}{99405}l knew l'd killed her|in some cruel...
{99410}{99461}gruesome way.
{99487}{99582}l woke up again and|found myself sitting on my bed.
{99587}{99690}The heavy traffic on the highway|down below had started up.
{99695}{99742}Everything was as usual.
{99769}{99862}Katarina slept beside me.|Her breathing was calm.
{99944}{99994}Can you help me?
{100058}{100122}Can l be helped?
{100170}{100234}Can l continue living longer?
{100284}{100333}Am l really alive?
{100383}{100520}Or was my dream in effect|the only brief moment of life l had?
{100561}{100644}Of experienced|and vanquished reality?
{100864}{100978}Two days before the catastrophe,|Peter threatens to kill himself.
{100987}{101102}Sorry to bother you so early,|but could l speak to Prof. Jensen?
{101145}{101196}No, thank you. My apologies.
{101508}{101625}Thank you for coming. l didn't know|what to do. Can you talk to him?
{101630}{101717}He's outside on the roof.|-Yes.
{102052}{102193}lt's respectable to want to jump, but|inhumane to torment his fellow men.
{102359}{102459}Soon someone will see you|and alert the police.
{102464}{102507}Are you cold?
{102552}{102672}Can't l at least get your fur coat?|-That would be very nice of you.
{102821}{102942}Katarina, where's his fur coat?|-l'll get it for you.
{103419}{103477}Peter.|-Leave me alone.
{103544}{103674}Martha sends her regards.|-Poor Martha. We disturbed her.
{103679}{103786}Not at all. She had an early|operation at the children's clinic.
{103812}{103862}lsn't she priggish?
{103927}{104057}Come, sit with me.|-l'm fine on the floor.
{104100}{104165}We had a drink|with Johann and Marianne.
{104170}{104296}Then we all went out to that new|ltalian restaurant near the theatre.
{104319}{104388}We ran into Melkers|and his lady friend.
{104393}{104470}They insisted that|we go back to their house.
{104496}{104560}Can l have a cigarette?
{104565}{104649}Thank you.|-What's that on your neck?
{104654}{104717}Her necklace broke.|-l see.
{104722}{104785}l got caught in it,|and then it broke.
{104790}{104861}Make sure it doesn't get infected.|-Oh...
{104866}{104978}Katarina says she wants to leave me.|l say, Great. What a godsend.
{104983}{105051}Then she says|she can't live without me.
{105056}{105151}l say l can live better without her.|She says l'm impotent.
{105156}{105259}Our fight started at the restaurant.|-l say l'm only impotent with her.
{105264}{105367}At first he was funny,|but then he started mimicking me.
{105372}{105490}lt was awkward, and l started to cry.|-She knows exactly when to cry.
{105495}{105581}Now l'll tell you why we quarreled.|-Now for the aria.
{105586}{105667}Shut up, Peter.|You've had your performance.
{105674}{105743}Peter wanted to fuck|when we came home.
{105748}{105827}l was tired and hoped|it wouldn't take too long.
{105832}{105904}But Peter wanted|a long, drawn-out fuck.
{105909}{106013}And l thought l could|still manage that. l always have.
{106021}{106147}Then he wanted to screw me from|behind but couldn't get his cock in.
{106178}{106252}He was probably too drunk.
{106318}{106366}Then l started...
{106371}{106434}Then l started to laugh.
{106439}{106512}Then he lost it|and started shouting at me.
{106517}{106643}But l couldn't stop laughing.|l couldn't control myself.
{106672}{106755}Then l said l could go down|on him. He likes that.
{106760}{106862}He grabbed my necklace and|twisted it. l almost suffocated.
{106867}{106972}l know how to satisfy you. l know|how to give Katarina an orgasm.
{106977}{107049}Want to know how?|-Over the past 10 years...
{107054}{107139}l've probably had|832 orgasms with you.
{107149}{107259}l faked it 513 times and later went|into the bathroom to masturbate.
{107264}{107375}True, l had a lousy|little twitch on occasion.
{107402}{107535}l'm terribly grateful|that Peter Egermann taught me...
{107540}{107582}how to feel like a woman.
{107699}{107777}Poor Peter,|l feel so damn sorry for you.
{107805}{107929}l really feel sorry for you.|-Now comes the story of her loyalty.
{107934}{108076}Let's amuse him with another story.|-At least your big mouth still works.
{108081}{108119}He's afraid of silence.
{108165}{108289}Silence harbours the truth. Her|truth, that is. l don't have a truth.
{108294}{108452}Fact is, Katarina has a life-long|contract with the objective truth.
{108457}{108599}Partly because she's a woman. As a|woman, she's entitled to such views.
{108604}{108748}And partly because she is Katarina,|especially chosen and created by God.
{108792}{108878}l think l should|lie down for a while.
{108883}{108952}When is Bauer expecting us?|-At ten.
{108957}{109072}You can sleep for at least an hour.|Take a hot shower later.
{109110}{109200}Do you need any help?|-How very kind of you.
{109205}{109312}l can manage by myself.|Thank you for coming, dear Arthur.
{109317}{109442}You're a real friend. When l see|you and Katarina together...
{109447}{109573}l suddenly realize what|an extraordinary couple you'd be.
{109578}{109679}As Christ said on the cross,|''Mother, look at your son.
{109684}{109752}Son, look at your mother.''
{109905}{109982}l was a hysterical silly goose.
{110081}{110129}What are you thinking?
{110134}{110280}That you're playing that old record:|lt was my fault. Forgive me, darling.
{110285}{110353}Then you end up smelling like a rose.
{110358}{110443}lf l think l was hysterical,|shouldn't l say so?
{110448}{110485}No.
{110553}{110619}Then what should l do?|-Nothing.
{110656}{110777}Whatever you say, Peter.
{110782}{110881}l don't mind your lying here,|but keep your trap shut.
{110886}{110983}Peter.|-Cut it out. That's pointless.
{111173}{111274}Couldn't we talk to each other?|-No.
{111300}{111376}Couldn't we at least give it a try?
{111381}{111450}We've already tried 100,000 times.
{111455}{111557}The next time we fight we'll use|whatever we said as a weapon.
{111600}{111673}Do you remember how hard|we tried at first?
{111678}{111737}We had capital.
{111765}{111838}Call it love capital, if you will.
{111843}{111943}We threw it all away needlessly.|Do you know why?
{111948}{112048}We accepted the rules|but had no knack for the game.
{112053}{112108}And then we were betrayed.
{112113}{112179}Do you know|what scares me the most?
{112184}{112346}That l can't go to work,|read my paper, eat regular meals.
{112351}{112467}Not being able to sleep, being|constipated, the car breaking down...
{112472}{112548}getting sick, having a toothache.
{112553}{112668}The slightest hitch could ruin my|carefully devised security system.
{112715}{112791}lf that were true,|you wouldn't drink so much.
{112796}{112879}l drink to have the courage|to switch off my system.
{112884}{112918}For what purpose?
{112956}{113017}To blow myself up.
{113083}{113117}And what remains?
{113128}{113209}Mincemeat of sorts.|Of blood and nerves.
{113274}{113332}And that's supposed to be better?
{113387}{113484}At least l'd be more like|the reality that encases me.
{114296}{114423}Three weeks after the catastrophe,|Katarina visits Peter's mother.
{114432}{114524}l'm all alone in this big house...
{114529}{114614}and don't feel like|seeing a single person.
{114619}{114723}l don't even want to go out.|-Why not leave for a few months?
{114728}{114810}Yes, my sister asked me|to visit her in Paris.
{114815}{114856}You really should take a trip.
{114909}{114997}What if Peter asks for me?|-Have you seen him?
{115028}{115107}No. l can't go there.
{115112}{115149}Not yet.
{115238}{115317}l went to see him yesterday.|-Yes?
{115345}{115417}He doesn't seem to be all there.
{115422}{115523}Do you think he's in distress?|-No, he's getting injections.
{115528}{115612}l wish an injection could|catapult me out of this hell.
{115626}{115687}This truly is hell.
{115692}{115758}l walk around all day by myself.
{115763}{115852}l put on my coat|to take a walk in the park...
{115871}{115982}but l can't go out the door.|l don't know what to do.
{115993}{116148}Maybe l should go to the doctor,|but the old Jacobi is so senile.
{116153}{116267}l could ask Prof. Jensen|to get in touch with you.
{116272}{116367}That might be a good idea.|-l'll call him tomorrow.
{116402}{116465}l'm so lonely, Katarina.
{116470}{116522}l can come to see you every day.
{116555}{116642}You've got enough worries as it is.|-Everyone does.
{116710}{116840}You think it's all my fault.|You've always been very critical...
{116845}{116966}of Peter's and my relationship.|-You were critical of our marriage.
{116971}{117104}l'm his mother, Katarina. l'm|closer to him than any other person.
{117109}{117241}l gave birth to him and raised him.|He's a part of my life.
{117246}{117367}You don't have any children. You|don't understand a mother's feelings.
{117423}{117471}The responsibility...
{117517}{117553}the guilt...
{117558}{117650}the shame.|-You're right. l don't understand.
{117663}{117785}l'm sorry. l didn't mean to hurt you.|-You didn't hurt me.
{117790}{117877}l feel sorry for you.|-l don't believe that.
{117882}{118009}l've been here for half an hour. All|you've talked about is your feelings.
{118014}{118086}Your problems,|your guilt, your shame.
{118091}{118234}Forgive me, Katarina. l thought you'd|come here so that we could talk.
{118239}{118297}l thought we could talk...
{118302}{118342}about our feelings.
{118397}{118508}l don't know what l thought we'd do.|-l also thought of you.
{118513}{118575}Every hour of the day|l thought of you.
{118580}{118628}l am also lonely.
{118684}{118721}Yes.
{118738}{118844}Full of astonishment|l look back on our lives...
{118849}{118939}on our former reality|and think it was all a dream.
{118973}{119068}lt was a game. Lord knows|what the hell we were doing.
{119102}{119192}This is true reality,|and it's unbearable.
{119197}{119287}l talk, answer, think,|put on my clothes...
{119292}{119433}sleep and eat. lt's a daily|compulsion. A strange, hard surface.
{119438}{119524}But under that surface, l'm crying.
{119572}{119641}l'm crying for myself...
{119680}{119754}because l can no longer be|the way l was.
{119804}{119926}What was, can never be again.|lt's been destroyed. lt's gone...
{119931}{119972}like a dream.
{120033}{120082}l cry for Peter.
{120140}{120270}l've never been able to put myself|in other people's shoes.
{120275}{120428}But suddenly l think l know|what Peter is feeling and thinking.
{120433}{120567}l realize that he's unprotected,|frightened and lonely.
{120572}{120618}So very lonely.
{120664}{120787}He has turned away, won't return, no|matter how much we call out to him.
{120870}{120937}But the worst part of it is...
{120942}{121027}the horrible part,|one l can barely talk about...
{121032}{121187}is that poor woman. l tell myself she|was only frightened for a moment...
{121199}{121292}that she didn't realize|what was happening to her.
{121329}{121372}That doesn't help.
{121460}{121496}Doesn't help.
{122802}{122877}50 minutes before the catastrophe...
{122882}{122959}Peter goes to see the|prostitute Katarina Krafft.
{124142}{124199}Good evening.|-Evening.
{124266}{124366}We're closing up for the night.
{124371}{124472}Pack up. We're closing.
{124477}{124527}We're closing up.
{124658}{124711}Bye.
{124769}{124839}She's willing to stay till six.|-Thanks.
{124844}{124960}Actually it's against the rules.|Because of the fire insurance.
{124988}{125107}But you have be gone by six. The|police always pay us an early visit.
{125112}{125263}The cops from the night shift|drop by for a quickie and a coffee.
{125268}{125367}Later in the police report|they call it a ''routine visit''.
{125426}{125488}Come in. lt'll just take a minute.
{125885}{125938}Do you want some wine?
{126459}{126556}l prefer you with your make-up on.|-Fine.
{126561}{126625}lf it's not too much trouble.|-Oh, no.
{126630}{126689}But please no false eyelashes.
{126694}{126810}Of course.|-lt's pretty stuffy in here, huh?
{126815}{126866}lt's not that bad.
{126871}{126992}They forgot to put in ventilation|vents when they renovated the rooms.
{126997}{127075}So we have to leave|the basement door open.
{127080}{127200}We get some pretty strange guests.|Won't you take your coat off?
{127205}{127289}Sorry, l forgot my paper.|l've got to take it home.
{127294}{127385}l bought it this morning,|and now it's already so late.
{127390}{127427}Don't forget. By six.
{127503}{127562}Did you like my act?
{127607}{127657}Not particularly.
{127737}{127820}Have you been working here long?|-For three years.
{127825}{127920}When l came, this place|was still brand-new.
{127925}{128004}How's the money?|-l can't complain.
{128077}{128133}Got any more wine?
{128162}{128262}The bottles are in the|bookcase beside the fridge.
{128359}{128396}You're strange.
{128587}{128682}There's something weird about you.
{128716}{128807}Do you have anything up your sleeve?|-l don't think so.
{128812}{128894}One of the girls wanted|to stay just in case.
{128899}{128985}Maybe it was stupid of me|to send her away.
{128990}{129030}Don't worry.
{129060}{129122}Something doesn't feel right.
{129152}{129217}Something's not right.
{129317}{129389}Are you scared?
{129394}{129489}A good judge of human nature.|-So now you're being ironic?
{129494}{129623}l'm always ironic.|lt's a disability of sorts.
{129628}{129712}Oh, man. l can't take this.
{129751}{129844}Listen, it's pretty|uncomfortable in here.
{129849}{129940}Don't you think? We could go|to one of the other rooms.
{129966}{130005}Come on, let's go.
{130150}{130182}Sylvia's son is so sweet
{130246}{130283}Go on.
{130386}{130492}ls this your room?|-l receive my customers in here.
{130531}{130615}lt's terribly hot.|Can't we open a window?
{130620}{130679}There are no windows.
{130717}{130816}l can't stand it in here.|-We can go up on stage.
{130845}{130940}There's more room up there.|And it's also quite comfy.
{130945}{130994}Come on, let's go.
{131642}{131697}What's your name?|-Ka.
{131702}{131799}But my real name's Katarina.
{131804}{131918}You have the same name as my wife.|-Now that's pretty weird.
{131923}{132007}Were you about to say something?
{132012}{132075}You misunderstood me just now.
{132080}{132182}l thought your act was|primitive and rather boring.
{132187}{132273}On the other hand,|l find you enchanting.
{132278}{132322}Enchanting.
{132620}{132746}Sit down over there.|l want to look at you.
{132880}{132917}Like this?
{132948}{132992}lt'd be better if you got up.
{133195}{133232}ls this any better?
{133254}{133291}Look at me.
{133326}{133363}Well?
{133400}{133477}Don't other men ask you|to do worse things?
{133482}{133527}This is worse.
{133802}{133848}There is no way out.
{134378}{134422}Are you leaving?
{134527}{134611}There is no way out.|-You're talking nonsense.
{134616}{134653}Come on...
{135696}{135792}l told you that we have|to keep all the doors locked.
{135849}{135897}You have to stay.
{136057}{136107}Shall l make some coffee?
{136290}{136376}lt's too bright in here.|Can't we turn off the light?
{136381}{136495}We complained about it, but|no one listens to us around here.
{136672}{136747}What kind of smell is that?|-Smell?
{136752}{136867}Yes, l smell something.|-lt always reeks of dust, sweat...
{136872}{136942}perfume, cigarette smoke.
{136982}{137088}When the toilet is clogged,|it reeks of shit. What do you smell?
{137093}{137213}No idea. Maybe l'm imagining it.|-My sense of smell is shot.
{137218}{137282}l don't smell anything anymore.
{137358}{137494}When l was a kid, my mother'd take|me to see her parents in Denmark.
{137499}{137607}l remember how the seasons smelled.|-The seasons?
{137612}{137705}Yes. Winter...
{137710}{137826}winter smelled like snow,|coal stoves and wet gloves.
{137831}{137955}And summer smelled|like seaweed and anthills.
{137960}{138058}Spring smelled like melting ice|and snow in deep ditches...
{138063}{138164}budding Easter catkins and rain.
{138169}{138253}But the autumn was|the most beautiful of all...
{138481}{138527}l wasn't asleep.
{138538}{138635}Why don't you take off|that stupid coat of yours?
{138640}{138724}lt's pretty warm in here, isn't it?
{138729}{138767}Yes.
{139370}{139424}l'm tired.
{139442}{139547}Four weeks later, the psychiatrist|Prof. Mogens Jensen...
{139552}{139719}dictates a preliminary evaluation|late in the night.
{139813}{139920}Regarding our patient,|the dominant mother...
{139925}{140063}and frequent absences of the father|gave rise to latent homosexuality.
{140068}{140141}Peter Egermann|was not aware of this...
{140146}{140228}but it had a disruptive effect|on his marriage...
{140233}{140321}and on his relationships|with other women.
{140349}{140484}This fact, as well as his aggression|that had been turned into fear...
{140489}{140611}toward his dominant mother|found no true outlet...
{140616}{140670}in his social surroundings...
{140675}{140776}since any emotional outburst|would have been considered...
{140781}{140884}almost obscene.
{140889}{141024}Consequently, he distanced himself|from his feelings early in life.
{141029}{141116}lnstead of being himself,|he adopted attitudes.
{141121}{141254}He played the role as dictated|by his education and his milieu.
{141277}{141376}Excuse me, professor.|l didn't know you were still here.
{141381}{141454}l just need a few more minutes.|Good night.
{141715}{141797}A highly developed sense of duty...
{141802}{141886}self-discipline|practised since childhood...
{141891}{141998}and considerable social success|prevented the patient...
{142003}{142092}from giving his feelings free rein.
{142123}{142240}He was obviously very attached|to his wife who, like his mother...
{142245}{142367}is a possessive|and strong-willed person.
{142417}{142501}The inexplicable fear|and the fear of this fear...
{142506}{142620}were practised in a closed|social ritualistic pattern...
{142625}{142743}in which the consumption|of drugs and alcohol...
{142748}{142857}is an acceptable, yes,|even recommended outlet.
{142862}{142966}Maybe nothing would have happened|if he'd stayed in his milieu.
{142971}{143111}The catastrophe occurs the moment|he has contact with the prostitute.
{143116}{143158}All becomes possible.
{143169}{143338}Anything could have triggered it.|A word, a gesture, a tone of voice.
{143343}{143496}He had an emotional blackout,|during which he killed the girl.
{143533}{143615}And in a presumably|ecstatic moment...
{143620}{143712}Egermann consummates|the sexual act with the dead girl.
{143786}{143874}The emotional avalanche|has now been set free.
{143911}{144037}You only possess or have control|over the person you have killed.
{144042}{144152}The patient broke all social|and emotional taboos...
{144157}{144248}and is now a potential|suicide case himself.
{144253}{144348}He is subject to the same|rule that l just enumerated:
{144379}{144512}Only he who kills himself|has total control over himself.
{144707}{144745}Right after he gets up...
{144750}{144821}after breakfast|and making his bed -
{144826}{144946}he gets up before the others -|he starts up his chess program.
{144951}{145119}He chooses a difficult level on the|computer and plays for several days.
{145124}{145241}He is very polite to the staff,|but at the same time very reserved.
{145246}{145406}He grooms his body meticulously and|cleans his room at least once a day.
{145411}{145487}He treats his bedspread|with special care.
{145492}{145622}lt takes him 15 minutes to get it|as flat and smooth as he wants it.
{145649}{145717}He doesn't read|any books or newspapers.
{145722}{145817}He never listens|to the radio or watches TV.
{145822}{145876}He has anxiety attacks...
{145881}{145992}but refuses all help.|He rejects our attempts to help him.
{146045}{146159}At night, he takes a tattered|old teddy bear to bed with him.
{146164}{146227}Probably a childhood memento.
