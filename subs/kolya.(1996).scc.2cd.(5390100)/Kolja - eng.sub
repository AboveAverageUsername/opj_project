{19587}{19643}- She's Russian.|- Even worse.
{19645}{19706}It's not the aunt.|It's her niece.
{19707}{19754}Not even a niece,|Mr. Broz.

{24633}{24733}You'll get back on your feet again.|Eat up. There's more.
{24735}{24846}Mr. Holocek says|that we need new gutters.
{24848}{24983}- New gutters?|- Yes, he said they've rusted through.
{24985}{25089}He said that|2,000 would cover...

{25130}{25193}How am I going|to get the money?
{25195}{25281}This house has cleaned me out.
{25283}{25375}I had to sell my car.|I'm in debt.
{25377}{25474}- Where am I going to get the money?|- Don't talk that way.
{25476}{25553}You know the house is yours...
{25555}{25630}now you've bought|your brother's share.
{25631}{25742}If you hadn't, we'd have lost it|to the state when Vitulka emigrated.
{25743}{25868}Would you have wanted me|to live with strangers?

{27139}{27193}Well, I'll be damned.
{27195}{27259}How did this get here?
{27343}{27444}It's not very|valuable, Franta.
{27446}{27503}It's just a piece|of costume jewelry.
{27527}{27625}- Where did you get this?|- I found it.
{27627}{27673}Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
{27675}{27748}And what do you think|it's worth?
{27750}{27803}I really have no idea.

{28514}{28561}There's no other explanation.
{28612}{28748}I mean, I agree to this|bogus marriage, I think.
{28915}{29044}You could talk to Nadezhda|in German.
{29046}{29163}She's an interpreter|between German and Russian.
{29165}{29241}I'm afraid|I speak neither.
{29243}{29326}That's just like|you Czechs!
{29327}{29426}First you don't like Germans,|then you don't like Russians.
{29428}{29484}It's not that.
{29486}{29554}I just have|no head for languages.

{94778}{94881}You didn't live together long|in that tower of yours, did you?

{96741}{96845}My colleague Parizek|and Mr. Broz.
{96874}{96950}Did your wife tell you|she would emigrate?

{97110}{97153}Yes, that too.
{97154}{97211}What will you do with him?
{97235}{97294}I'll probably keep him.

{128594}{128640}[Russian] Fish!
{128642}{128724}But because the water|is poisoned now by acid rain...

{132172}{132244}You sent us an application...
{132246}{132316}regarding this boy some time back.

{132528}{132591}You say here|that you play at night?
{132593}{132640}No, only during the day now.

{132874}{132950}He doesn't have his own bed?|Or room?
{132952}{133018}No, but there's|enough room...
{133070}{133195}So it's the boy's birthday?
{133197}{133309}Not really. I don't have his papers|so I decided it would be today.

{133627}{133716}He understands Czech|pretty well now.
{133718}{133827}His mother went to the West|and shows no interest in the boy.
{133829}{133942}That's not true.|She's applied to the Red Cross.
{133944}{134005}- Look, Mr. Lucina.|- Louka.
{134007}{134082}Even though|the boy's mother...
{134084}{134174}gained Czech nationality|by marriage,
{134176}{134264}she is still Russian.
{134266}{134361}So the Soviet authorities still|have an interest in this child.
{134390}{134473}The matter may be well|taken out of our hands.
{134506}{134596}They'll probably put him|in a home in the Soviet Union.
{134598}{134662}That's how I see it.
{134664}{134742}Look, Ms. Zubata,
{134744}{134820}that letter of mine...|couldn't it be canceled?
{134822}{134904}Why? They'll take care of the boy.

{135066}{135133}Next time,
{135134}{135213}I'll bring someone|from the Soviet Embassy...
