{393}{449}Skywalker's been forced|onto the service ramp!
{968}{1001}It's Skywalker!
{1025}{1057}Sebulba!
{1060}{1162}Amazing! A quick control thrust,|and he's back on course!
{1165}{1207}Did he crash-ed?
{2189}{2266}Skywalker's in trouble!|Sebulba takes the lead!
{3536}{3577}He's catching Sebulba!
{3604}{3664}Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!
{4392}{4449}That little human being|is out of his mind!
{4476}{4504}They're side by side!
{5191}{5236}- Yippee!|- Yay!
{5337}{5378}I can't believe it.
{5381}{5427}The crowds are going nuts!
{5641}{5690}Yay, Ani!
{5722}{5795}Mom, I did it! Yay!
{6047}{6092}Good going, Ani!
{6197}{6244}We owe you everything, Ani.
{6307}{6358}It's so wonderful, Ani.
{6361}{6426}You have brought hope|to those who have none.
{6429}{6482}I'm so very proud of you.
{6733}{6777}You!
{6780}{6836}You swindled me.
{6838}{6930}You knew the boy was going to win.|Somehow you knew it.
{6933}{6977}I lost everything.
{6980}{7066}Whenever you gamble, my friend,|eventually you lose.
{7069}{7127}Bring the parts|to the main hangar.
{7130}{7205}I'll come by your shop later on|so you can release the boy.
{7208}{7287}You can't have him.|It wasn't a fair bet.
{7352}{7436}Would you like to discuss it|with the Hutts?
{7438}{7499}I'm sure they can settle this.
{7535}{7580}Take him.
{7747}{7772}Hidoe!
{7811}{7861}Well, we have all|the essential parts we need.
{7863}{7888}I'm going back.
{7891}{7941}Some unfinished business.|I won't be long.
{7945}{8027}Why do I sense we've picked up|another pathetic life-form?
{8047}{8122}It's the boy who's responsible|for getting us these parts.
{8125}{8170}Get this hyperdrive|generator installed.
{8173}{8234}Yes, Master.|That shouldn't take long.
{8237}{8289}Come on. Hup!
{8400}{8445}Hey. These are yours.
{8493}{8523}Yes!
{8547}{8613}Mom, we sold the pod!|Look at all the money we have!
{8616}{8673}My goodness!|But that's so wonderful, Ani.
{8676}{8747}- And he has been freed.|- What?
{8750}{8793}You're no longer a slave.
{8839}{8885}Did you hear that?
{8904}{8963}Now you can make|your dreams come true, Ani.
{8984}{9030}You are free.
{9116}{9151}Will you take him with you?
{9154}{9193}Is he to become a Jedi?
{9196}{9257}Yes. Our meeting|was not a coincidence.
{9277}{9317}Nothing happens by accident.
{9320}{9405}You mean I get to come with you|in your starship?
{9408}{9442}Anakin...
{9488}{9567}training to become a Jedi|is not an easy challenge...
{9570}{9639}and even if you succeed,|it's a hard life.
{9642}{9718}But I wanna go. It's what|I've always dreamed of doing.
{9738}{9789}Can I go, Mom?
{9812}{9852}Anakin...
{9855}{9925}this path has been placed|before you.
{9928}{9987}The choice is yours alone.
{10075}{10120}I wanna do it.
{10182}{10235}Then pack your things.|We haven't much time.
{10394}{10432}What about Mom?
{10507}{10552}Is she free too?
{10555}{10639}I tried to free your mother, Ani,|but Watto wouldn't have it.
{10664}{10711}You're coming with us,|aren't you, Mom?
{10903}{10983}Son, my place is here.|My future is here.
{10986}{11043}It is time for you to let go.
{11070}{11121}I don't want things to change.
{11124}{11181}But you can't stop the change...
{11184}{11258}any more than you can|stop the suns from setting.
{11284}{11330}I love you.
{11466}{11511}Now hurry.
{11644}{11677}Thank you.
{11680}{11750}I'll watch after him.|You have my word .
{11804}{11840}Will you be all right?
{11875}{11910}Yeah.
{12031}{12069}Hello, Master Anakin.
{12072}{12122}Well, 3PO, I've been freed...
{12125}{12182}and I'm going away in a starship.
{12185}{12255}Master Anakin, you are my maker|and I wish you well.
{12258}{12359}However, I should prefer it|if I were a little more completed.
{12362}{12437}I'm sorry I wasn't able|to finish you, 3PO...
{12440}{12489}give you coverings and all.
{12492}{12531}I'm gonna miss working on you.
{12534}{12593}You've been a great pal.
{12596}{12659}I'll make sure Mom|doesn't sell you or anything.
{12678}{12703}Sell me?
{12706}{12745}Bye.
{12748}{12781}Oh, my.
{13372}{13425}I can't do it, Mom.|I just can't do it.
{13528}{13576}Will I ever see you again?
{13611}{13679}What does your heart tell you?
{13712}{13758}I hope so.
{13776}{13820}Yes.
{13823}{13862}I guess.
{13887}{13948}Then we will|see each other again.
{14014}{14081}I will come back|and free you, Mom.
{14084}{14125}I promise.
{14323}{14394}Now, be brave...
{14413}{14461}and don't look back.
{14479}{14525}Don't look back.
{15594}{15620}Qui-Gon, sir, wait!
{15623}{15665}- I'm tired!|- Anakin! Drop!
{15723}{15747}Go!
{15772}{15818}Tell them to take off!
{16120}{16154}Qui-Gon's in trouble.
{16186}{16219}Take off.
{16236}{16278}Over there. Fly low.
{16796}{16868}- Are you all right?|- I think so.
{16871}{16908}What was it?
{16911}{16953}I'm not sure...
{16956}{17017}but it was well-trained|in the Jedi arts.
{17023}{17080}My guess is|it was after the queen.
{17083}{17143}What are we gonna do about it?
{17190}{17229}We shall be patient.
{17232}{17259}Anakin Skywalker...
{17262}{17305}meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.
{17363}{17424}You're a Jedi too?|Pleased to meet you.
{17639}{17700}Your queen is lost,|your people are starving...
{17703}{17751}and you, Governor,|are going to die...
{17754}{17805}much sooner than your people,|I'm afraid.
{17808}{17868}This invasion|will gain you nothing.
{17871}{17943}We're a democracy.|The people have decided.
{17946}{17991}Take him away.
{18074}{18133}My troops are in position|to begin searching the swamps...
{18136}{18197}for these rumoured|underwater villages.
{18200}{18263}They will not|stay hidden for long.
{18528}{18593}The death toll is catastrophic.
{18596}{18659}We must bow to their wishes.
{18662}{18715}You must contact me.
{19054}{19100}You all right?
{19125}{19171}It's very cold.
{19362}{19428}You come from|a warm planet, Ani.
{19431}{19488}A little too warm|for my taste.
{19491}{19545}Space is cold.
{19548}{19599}You seem sad.
{19627}{19681}The queen is worried.
{19684}{19742}Her people are suffering, dying.
{19745}{19829}She must convince the senate|to intervene or...
{19864}{19919}I'm not sure what'll happen.
{19954}{20003}I made this for you...
{20039}{20084}so you'd remember me.
{20101}{20165}I carved it|out of a japor snippet.
{20168}{20236}It'll bring you good fortune.
{20239}{20284}It's beautiful.
{20287}{20344}But I don't need this|to remember you by.
{20432}{20513}Many things will change|when we reach the capital, Ani...
{20516}{20577}but my caring for you will remain.
{20642}{20717}I care for you, too, only I--
{20720}{20772}Miss your mother.
{21215}{21315}Coruscant.|The entire planet is one big city.
{21318}{21360}There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.
{21363}{21441}And look over there.|Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.
{22148}{22221}It is a great gift|to see you alive, Your Majesty.
{22224}{22295}With the communications break down,|we've been very concerned.
{22298}{22357}I'm anxious to hear your report|on the situation.
{22360}{22423}May I present|Supreme Chancellor Valorum.
{22426}{22473}Welcome, Your Highness.
{22476}{22525}It's an honour to finally|meet you in person.
{22528}{22563}Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.
{22566}{22650}I must relay to you how distressed|everyone is over the current situation.
{22653}{22735}I've called for a special session|of the senate to hear your position.
{22763}{22837}I'm grateful for your concern,|Chancellor.
{22840}{22885}There is a question|of procedure...
{22888}{22948}but I'm confident|we can overcome it.
{22968}{23020}I must speak with the Jedi Council|immediately.
{23023}{23090}The situation has become|much more complicated.
{23228}{23274}Ani, come on.
{23543}{23608}Da queen's a bein grossly nice,|mesa tinks.
{23640}{23687}Pitty hot.
{24356}{24431}There is no civility,|only politics.
{24462}{24555}The Republic|is not what it once was.
{24558}{24684}The senate is full of greedy,|squabbling delegates.
{24703}{24785}There is no interest|in the common good.
{24806}{24845}I must be frank, Your Majesty.
{24848}{24913}There is little chance the senate|will act on the invasion.
{24916}{24981}Chancellor Valorum|seems to think there is hope.
{24984}{25029}If I may say so, Your Majesty...
{25032}{25085}the chancellor|has little real power.
{25088}{25181}He is mired by baseless|accusations of corruption.
{25184}{25274}- The bureaucrats are in charge now.|- What options have we?
{25292}{25361}Our best choice would be|to push for the election...
{25364}{25417}of a stronger|supreme chancellor...
{25420}{25472}one who could control|the bureaucrats...
{25475}{25519}and give us justice.
{25540}{25671}You could call for a vote of|no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.
{25675}{25734}He has been|our strongest supporter.
{25738}{25863}Our only other choice would be|to submit a plea to the courts.
{25865}{25946}The courts take even longer|to decide things than the senate.
{25968}{26018}Our people are dying, Senator.
{26037}{26109}We must do something quickly|to stop the Federation.
{26112}{26171}To be realistic, Your Majesty...
{26175}{26234}I think we're going to have to|accept Federation control...
{26238}{26298}for the time being.
{26340}{26390}That is something I cannot do.
{26565}{26627}He was trained in the Jedi arts.
{26631}{26725}My only conclusion can be|that it was a Sith lord .
{26727}{26761}Impossible.
{26764}{26827}The Sith have been extinct|for a millennium.
{26831}{26931}I do not believe the Sith could|have returned without us knowing.
{26955}{27008}Hard to see,|the dark side is.
{27011}{27080}We will use all our resources|to unravel this mystery.
{27083}{27159}We will discover the identity|of your attacker.
{27163}{27202}May the Force be with you.
{27300}{27334}Master Qui-Gon.
{27356}{27399}More to say have you?
{27450}{27495}With your permission, my master...
{27532}{27604}I have encountered|a vergence in the Force.
{27631}{27679}A vergence, you say.
{27682}{27733}Located around a person?
{27736}{27765}A boy.
{27769}{27829}His cells have the highest|concentration of midi-chlorians...
{27832}{27875}I have seen in a life-form.
{27877}{27946}It is possible he was conceived|by the midi-chlorians.
{27988}{28081}You refer to the prophecy of the one|who will bring balance to the Force.
{28100}{28151}You believe it's this boy?
{28154}{28215}- I don't presume to--|- But you do.
{28234}{28281}Revealed your opinion is.
{28284}{28333}I request the boy be tested,|Master.
{28384}{28461}Trained as a Jedi|you request for him, hmm?
{28464}{28521}Finding him|was the will of the Force.
{28524}{28577}I have no doubt of that.
{28738}{28787}Bring him before us, then.
{29052}{29098}The boy's here to see PadmÈ.
{29101}{29139}Let him in.
{29215}{29309}I'm sorry, Ani, but PadmÈ's|not here right now.
{29312}{29352}Who is it?
{29371}{29443}Anakin Skywalker to see PadmÈ,|Your Highness.
{29446}{29489}I've sent PadmÈ on an errand.
{29492}{29537}I'm on my way|to the Jedi temple...
{29540}{29594}to start my training, I hope.
{29614}{29706}I may never see her again,|so I came to say goodbye.
{29732}{29819}We will tell her for you.|We are sure her heart goes with you.
{29846}{29871}Thank you, Your Highness.
{30207}{30305}The chair recognizes the senator|from the sovereign system of Naboo.
{30468}{30549}Supreme Chancellor,|delegates of the senate...
{30576}{30633}a tragedy has occurred...
{30636}{30720}which started right here|with the taxation of trade routes...
{30723}{30795}and has now engulfed|our entire planet...
{30798}{30846}in the oppression|of the Trade Federation.
{30867}{30901}This is outrageous!
{30904}{30965}I object|to the senator's statements.
{30968}{31065}The chair does not recognize the senator|from the Trade Federation at this time.
{31068}{31161}To state our allegations,|I present Queen Amidala...
{31164}{31212}recently elected|ruler of the Naboo...
{31215}{31259}who speaks on our behalf.
{31404}{31470}Honourable representatives|of the Republic...
{31488}{31546}I come to you under the gravest|of circumstances.
{31550}{31619}The Naboo system has been invaded|by the droid armies of the Trade--
{31621}{31707}I object!|There is no proof!
{31709}{31755}This is incredible.
{31758}{31852}We recommend a commission be sent|to Naboo to ascertain the truth.
{31856}{31887}The Congress of Malastare...
{31890}{31962}concurs with the honourable delegate|from the Trade Federation.
{31965}{32014}A commission must be appointed.
{32017}{32077}- The point--|- Excuse me, Chancellor.
{32080}{32119}Enter the bureaucrat.
{32121}{32184}The true rulers of the Republic.
{32188}{32288}And on the payroll|of the Trade Federation, I might add.
{32290}{32392}This is where Chancellor Valorum's|strength will disappear.
{32430}{32484}The point is conceded.
{32488}{32551}Will you defer your motion|to allow a commission...
{32554}{32621}to explore the validity|of your accusations?
{32624}{32669}I will not defer.
{32671}{32756}I've come before you to resolve|this attack on our sovereignty now.
{32759}{32831}I was not elected to watch|my people suffer and die...
{32834}{32898}while you discuss this invasion|in a committee.
{32969}{33025}If this body|is not capable of action...
{33028}{33077}I suggest new leadership is needed.
{33159}{33212}I move for a vote|of no confidence...
{33215}{33263}in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.
{33432}{33484}Vote now! Vote now!
{33575}{33621}Order!
{33624}{33693}Now they will elect|a new chancellor...
{33696}{33741}a strong chancellor...
{33744}{33814}one who will not|let our tragedy continue.
{33855}{33957}The boy will not pass the council's|test, Master. He's too old.
{33960}{34035}Anakin will become a Jedi,|I promise you.
{34038}{34103}Do not defy the council,|Master, not again.
{34106}{34171}I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.
{34217}{34307}If you would just follow the code,|you would be on the council.
{34310}{34359}They will not go along|with you this time.
{34395}{34457}You still have much to learn,|my young apprentice.
{34536}{34569}A ship.
{34608}{34655}A cup.
{34658}{34701}A ship.
{34728}{34763}A speeder.
{34944}{34990}How feel you?
{35004}{35044}Cold, sir.
{35084}{35136}- Afraid are you?|- No, sir.
{35164}{35227}See through you we can.
{35230}{35275}Be mindful of your feelings.
{35278}{35344}Your thoughts dwell on your mother.
{35384}{35418}I miss her.
{35448}{35507}Afraid to lose her,|I think, mmm?
{35510}{35561}What has that got to do|with anything?
{35564}{35620}Everything.
{35623}{35696}Fear is the path to the dark side.
{35699}{35768}Fear leads to anger.|Anger leads to hate.
{35771}{35851}Hate leads to suffering.
{36008}{36078}I sense much fear in you.
{36388}{36469}Yousa tinking|yousa people ganna die?
{36472}{36504}I don't know.
{36536}{36581}Gungans get pasted too, eh?
{36640}{36689}I hope not.
{36708}{36761}Gungans no die'n without a fight.
{36764}{36809}Wesa warriors.
{36812}{36890}Wesa got a grand army.
{36893}{36970}Dat's why you no liken us,|mesa tinks.
{36973}{37005}Your Highness?
{37069}{37120}Your Highness...
{37123}{37197}Senator Palpatine has been nominated|to succeed Valorum...
{37200}{37233}as supreme chancellor.
{37236}{37329}A surprise, to be sure,|but a welcome one.
{37332}{37437}Your Majesty, if I am elected,|I promise to put an end to corruption.
{37440}{37480}Who else has been nominated?
{37483}{37586}Bail Antilles of Alderaan|and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.
{37589}{37707}I feel confident our situation will|create a strong sympathy vote for us.
{37748}{37796}I will be chancellor.
{37799}{37861}I fear by the time you have control|of the bureaucrats, Senator...
{37864}{37941}there'll be nothing left|of our people, our way of life.
{37944}{37989}I understand your concern,|Your Majesty.
{37992}{38077}Unfortunately, the Federation|has possession of our planet.
{38120}{38211}Senator, this is your arena.
{38220}{38266}I feel I must return to mine.
{38344}{38399}I've decided to go back to Naboo.
{38402}{38423}Go back?
{38426}{38497}But, Your Majesty, be realistic.|They'll force you to sign the treaty.
{38500}{38557}I will sign no treaty, Senator.
{38560}{38627}My fate will be no different|than that of our people.
{38630}{38668}- Captain.|- Your Highness.
{38671}{38726}- Ready my ship.|- Please, Your Majesty.
{38729}{38774}Stay here where it's safe.
{38810}{38886}It is clear to me now that|the Republic no longer functions.
{38904}{39003}I pray you will bring sanity|and compassion back to the senate.
{39236}{39298}The Force is strong with him.
{39301}{39347}He is to be trained, then?
{39398}{39455}No, he will not be trained.
{39458}{39498}No?
{39547}{39596}He is too old.
{39599}{39690}He is the chosen one.|You must see it.
{39718}{39803}Clouded this boy's future is.
{39856}{39900}I will train him, then.
{40004}{40072}I take Anakin|as my Padawan learner.
{40075}{40145}An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.
{40148}{40205}Impossible to take on a second.
{40208}{40248}The code forbids it.
{40251}{40332}- Obi-Wan is ready.|- I am ready to face the trials.
{40335}{40422}Our own counsel we will keep|on who is ready.
{40446}{40509}He is headstrong and he has much|to learn of the living Force...
{40512}{40553}but he is capable.
{40556}{40604}There is little more|he can learn from me.
{40666}{40757}Young Skywalker's fate|will be decided later.
{40760}{40822}Now is not the time for this.
{40841}{40888}The senate is voting|for a new supreme chancellor...
{40891}{40955}and Queen Amidala|is returning home...
{40958}{41035}which puts pressure on the Federation|and could widen the confrontation.
{41038}{41093}And draw out the queen's attacker.
{41096}{41201}Go with the queen to Naboo and discover|the identity of this dark warrior.
{41232}{41269}This is the clue we need...
{41272}{41334}to unravel|the mystery of the Sith.
{41351}{41404}May the Force be with you.
{41720}{41789}It's not disrespect, Master.|It's the truth.
{41792}{41837}From your point of view.
{41840}{41921}The boy is dangerous.|They all sense it. Why can't you?
{41924}{41993}His fate is uncertain.|He's not dangerous.
{41996}{42053}The council will decide|Anakin's future.
{42056}{42126}That should be enough for you.|Now get on board .
{42262}{42352}Qui-Gon, sir,|I don't want to be a problem.
{42355}{42408}You won't be, Ani.
{42411}{42457}I'm not allowed to train you...
{42460}{42509}so I want you to watch me|and be mindful.
{42512}{42562}Always remember:
{42584}{42647}Your focus determines your reality.
{42650}{42736}Stay close to me|and you'll be safe.
{42739}{42772}Master, sir...
{42775}{42861}I heard Yoda talking|about midi-chlorians.
{42864}{42948}I've been wondering--|What are midi-chlorians?
{42979}{43036}Midi-chlorians are|a microscopic life-form...
{43039}{43093}that resides|within all living cells.
{43128}{43197}- They live inside me?|- Inside your cells, yes.
{43200}{43283}- And we are symbionts with them.|- Symbionts?
{43286}{43379}Life-forms living together|for mutual advantage.
{43382}{43451}Without the midi-chlorians,|life could not exist...
{43454}{43521}and we would have|no knowledge of the Force.
{43524}{43569}They continually speak to us...
{43572}{43636}telling us the will of the Force.
{43639}{43689}When you learn|to quiet your mind...
{43692}{43737}you'll hear them speaking to you.
{43740}{43785}I don't understand.
{43788}{43872}With time and training, Ani,|you will. You will.
{43969}{44059}Your Majesty, it is our pleasure|to continue to serve and protect you.
{44076}{44110}I welcome your help.
{44113}{44202}Senator Palpatine fears that|the Federation means to destroy me.
{44205}{44277}I assure you I will not|allow that to happen.
{44280}{44349}Wesa goin' home!
{44352}{44397}Come on, R2.
{44643}{44700}Is the planet secure?
{44703}{44796}We have taken over the last pockets|of primitive life-forms.
{44799}{44873}We are in complete control|of the planet now.
{44876}{44952}Good. I will see to it|that in the senate...
{44955}{45025}things stay as they are.
{45028}{45112}I am sending my apprentice,|Darth Maul, to join you.
{45115}{45160}Yes, my lord .
{45163}{45208}A Sith here?
{45338}{45397}Those are the forward stabilizers.
{45400}{45457}And those two control the pitch?
{45495}{45540}You catch on pretty quick.
{45543}{45585}As soon as we land...
{45588}{45651}the Federation will arrest you|and force you to sign the treaty.
{45654}{45679}I agree.
{45682}{45748}I'm not sure what you wish|to accomplish by this.
{45751}{45810}I will take back what's ours.
{45829}{45881}There are too few of us,|Your Highness.
{45884}{45929}We have no army.
{45932}{45965}And I can only protect you.
{45968}{46017}I can't fight a war for you.
{46042}{46067}Jar Jar Binks.
{46089}{46141}Mesa, Your Highness?
{46144}{46214}Yes. I need your help.
{46340}{46393}I have one battleship on my scope.
{46396}{46445}It's a droid control ship.
{46448}{46501}They've probably spotted us.
{46504}{46545}We haven't much time.
{46826}{46890}Jar Jar is on his way|to the Gungan city, Master.
{46893}{46924}Good.
{46927}{46981}Do you think|the queen's idea will work?
{46984}{47023}The Gungans will not|be easily swayed.
{47073}{47129}And we cannot use our power|to help her.
{47172}{47246}I'm sorry for|my behaviour, Master.
{47249}{47338}It's not my place to disagree|with you about the boy.
{47384}{47463}And I am grateful you think|I'm ready to take the trials.
{47491}{47536}You've been a good apprentice,|Obi-Wan.
{47571}{47635}And you're a much wiser man|than I am.
{47652}{47732}I foresee you will become|a great Jedi knight.
{48044}{48101}Desa nobody dare!
{48104}{48156}The Gungan city is deserted!
{48159}{48220}Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.
{48223}{48297}Do you think they have been taken|to the camps?
{48300}{48356}More likely they were wiped out.
{48359}{48432}- Mesa no tink so.|- Do you know where they are, Jar Jar?
{48435}{48517}When in trouble,|Gungans go to sacred place.
{48520}{48589}Mesa show you.|Come on. Mesa show you!
{49029}{49115}Your Honour,|Queen Amidala of the Naboo.
{49275}{49355}Heyo dadee|Big Boss Nass, Your Honour.
{49374}{49432}Jar Jar Binks.
{49444}{49522}Who's da uss-en uthers?
{49536}{49591}I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.
{49611}{49669}I come before you in peace.
{49672}{49740}Ah, Naboo biggen.
{49743}{49819}Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.
{49822}{49911}Yousa all bombad.
{49932}{50000}We have searched you out|because we wish to form an alliance.
{50003}{50036}Your Honour.
{50088}{50159}Whosa dis?
{50162}{50215}I am Queen Amidala.
{50255}{50293}This is my decoy...
{50296}{50383}my protection,|my loyal bodyguard .
{50386}{50489}I'm sorry for my deception,|but it was necessary to protect myself.
{50492}{50553}Although we do not always agree,|Your Honour...
{50556}{50617}our two great societies|have always lived in peace.
{50660}{50736}The Trade Federation has destroyed all|that we have worked so hard to build.
{50739}{50817}If we do not act quickly,|all will be lost forever.
{50820}{50873}I ask you to help us.
{50876}{50941}No, I beg you to help us.
{50944}{51001}We are your humble servants.
{51079}{51146}Our fate is in your hands.
{51559}{51661}Yousa no tinken yousa|greater den da Gungans?
{51720}{51814}Mesa lika dis!
{51839}{51860}Maybe...
{51862}{51923}wesa...
{51927}{51972}being friends.
{52181}{52223}We've sent our patrols.
{52227}{52310}We already located|their starship in the swamp.
{52312}{52365}It won't be long, my lord .
{52368}{52443}This is|an unexpected move for her.
{52446}{52494}It 's too aggressive.
{52497}{52555}Lord Maul, be mindful.
{52558}{52619}Let them make the first move.
{52622}{52667}Yes, my master.
{52752}{52792}Deysa comin!
{52795}{52827}All right!
{52912}{52954}They're here!
{52957}{52990}Good. They made it.
{53099}{53164}Yousa doen grand.
{53167}{53241}Jar Jar bring uss-en|and da Naboo together.
{53244}{53289}Oh, no, no, no.
{53292}{53362}So, wesa make you...
{53366}{53426}bombad general.
{53429}{53462}General?
{53536}{53572}Captain.
{53574}{53636}- Your Highness.|- What is the situation?
{53640}{53685}Almost everyone's in camps.
{53687}{53765}A few hundred police and guards formed|an underground resistance movement.
{53768}{53829}I brought back as many|of the leaders as I could.
{53832}{53901}The Federation army's also|much larger than we thought...
{53904}{53944}and much stronger.
{53974}{54048}Your Highness, this is a battle|I do not think that we can win.
{54052}{54105}The battle is a diversion.
{54108}{54177}The Gungans must draw the droid army|away from the cities.
{54180}{54217}R2.
{54244}{54327}We can enter the city using the secret|passages on the waterfall side.
{54330}{54371}Once we get|to the main entrance...
{54373}{54448}Captain Panaka|will create a diversion.
{54451}{54521}Then we can enter the palace|and capture the viceroy.
{54539}{54606}Without the viceroy,|they will be lost and confused.
{54609}{54648}What do you think, Master Jedi?
{54652}{54704}The viceroy will be well-guarded.
{54707}{54767}The difficulty is getting|into the throne room.
{54770}{54824}Once we're inside,|we shouldn't have a problem.
{54828}{54941}There is a possibility, with this|diversion, many Gungans will be killed.
{54944}{55023}Wesa ready to do our-san part.
{55026}{55101}We have a plan which should|immobilize the droid army.
{55104}{55148}We will send|what pilots we have...
{55152}{55224}to knock out the droid control ship|orbiting the planet.
{55228}{55301}A well-conceived plan.|However, there's great risk.
{55304}{55379}The weapons on your fighters|may not penetrate the shields.
{55382}{55421}There's an even bigger danger.
{55423}{55469}If the viceroy escapes,|Your Highness...
{55472}{55524}he will return|with another droid army.
{55528}{55605}Well, that is why we must not fail|to get the viceroy.
{55608}{55654}Everything depends on it.
{55782}{55845}She is more foolish|than I thought.
{55848}{55895}We are sending all troops...
{55898}{55967}to meet this army|assembling near the swamp.
{55970}{56033}It appears to be made up|of primitives.
{56036}{56097}This will work to our advantage.
{56099}{56167}I have your approval|to proceed, then, my lord ?
{56186}{56227}Wipe them out.
{56268}{56312}All of them.
{57054}{57086}Halt!
{57170}{57223}Starting up the shield.
{57932}{57961}Open fire.
{58347}{58423}Once we get inside, you find|a safe place to hide and stay there.
{58427}{58473}- Sure.|- Stay there.
{58856}{58905}Roger, roger.
{59098}{59173}I thought the battle was going|to take place far from here.
{59198}{59235}This is too close.
{59378}{59435}Ani, find cover.
{59437}{59493}- Quick!|- Get to your ships!
{60902}{60929}Fighters straight ahead.
{60932}{60959}Roger, Bravo Leader.
{60961}{60991}Roger, Bravo Leader.
{61198}{61224}Cease fire.
{61406}{61464}Steady. Steady.
{62258}{62335}- Activate the droids.|- Yes, sir.
{62731}{62777}Ouch time.
{63115}{63141}Fire!
{63674}{63719}My guess is the viceroy's|in the throne room.
{63722}{63757}Red group! Blue group!
{63760}{63803}Everybody, this way!
{63806}{63855}Hey, wait for me!
{63858}{63915}Anakin, stay where you are.|You'll be safe there.
{63918}{63966}- But I--|- Stay in that cockpit.
{64258}{64335}- We'll handle this.|- We'll take the long way.
{64819}{64865}We gotta do something, R2.
{65411}{65484}I'm trying to!|I don't know where the trigger is!
{65567}{65640}Oops, wrong one.|Maybe it's this one.
{65664}{65673}Nope. Wait. Here it is.
{65673}{65723}Nope. Wait. Here it is.
{65776}{65799}Yeah!
{65928}{65964}Let's go!
{65990}{66044}It's on automatic pilot.
{66262}{66307}Try to override it.
{67747}{67793}We don't have time for this,|Captain.
{67940}{67984}Look, there they are.
{67987}{68044}That's where|the autopilot's taking us.
{68452}{68515}Dumb droid. Take that!
{68518}{68564}Get off! Get off! Get off!
{68567}{68595}Get off!
{68836}{68893}The deflector shield|is too strong.
{69116}{69156}This is tense!
{69211}{69259}R2, get us off this autopilot.
{69262}{69307}It's gonna get us both killed.
{69347}{69405}You did it, R2!
{69408}{69437}Let's go left.
{69562}{69589}Go back?
{69592}{69695}Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,|so that's what I'm gonna do.
{69860}{69919}I'll try spinning.|That's a good trick.
{70055}{70116}I know we're in trouble.|Just hang on.
{70280}{70304}Go!
{70420}{70461}Ascension guns!
{73486}{73525}Retreat! Retreat!
{73567}{73613}Dis is nutsen.
{73850}{73897}Uh-oh. Big boomers.
{74394}{74452}Give me a lift!
{74626}{74664}Jar Jar, usen da booma!
{74667}{74713}What?|Mesa no have a booma!
{74716}{74763}Here. Taken dis one.
{75157}{75183}Jar Jar!
{75186}{75233}Jump, Jar Jar, jump!
{75477}{75544}Put down your weapons.|They win this round.
{75854}{75905}We're hit, R2!
{76222}{76293}I'm trying to stop!|I'm trying to stop!
{76466}{76503}Everything's overheated.
{76538}{76585}Oops. This is not good.
{78322}{78375}No giben up, General Jar Jar.
{78378}{78423}Mesa think of something.
{78426}{78459}Hands up.
{78462}{78531}My give up. My give up.
{78740}{78815}Your little insurrection|is at an end, Your Highness.
{78818}{78863}Time for you|to sign the treaty and end...
{78866}{78911}this pointless debate in the senate.
{78914}{78956}Viceroy!
{78959}{79005}Your occupation here has ended.
{79043}{79124}After her.|This one's a decoy.
{79282}{79317}Captain!
{79539}{79588}Jam the doors.
{79671}{79740}Now, Viceroy,|we will discuss a new treaty.
{81255}{81315}Yes! We have power.|Shields up.
{81394}{81419}Take this!
{81467}{81493}And this!
{81682}{81724}- Oops.|- We're losing power.
{81727}{81771}There seems to be a problem|with the main reactor.
{81774}{81807}Impossible!
{81810}{81855}Nothing can get through our shield.
{81886}{81929}Let's get outta here.
{82122}{82185}What's that?|It's blowing up from the inside!
{82258}{82296}We didn't hit it.
{82370}{82419}Now, this is Podracing.
{82458}{82499}Look, one of ours,|out of the main hold!
{83012}{83047}What the--
{83050}{83103}Was'n they doing?
{83106}{83192}The control ship|has been destroyed. Look!
{83233}{83289}They all broke-ed.
{84450}{84531}No, it's too late.
{84534}{84589}- No.|- Obi-Wan.
{84620}{84665}Promise--
{84668}{84729}Promise me|you will train the boy.
{84732}{84769}Yes, Master.
{84867}{84929}He is the chosen one.
{84932}{85009}He will bring balance.
{85038}{85072}Train him.
{85732}{85775}Now, Viceroy...
{85778}{85860}you're going to have to go back|to the senate and explain all this.
{85902}{85981}I think you can kiss|your trade franchise goodbye.
{86310}{86395}We are indebted to you|for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
{86398}{86443}And you, young Skywalker.
{86462}{86541}We will watch your career|with great interest.
{86698}{86759}Congratulations on your election,|Chancellor.
{86762}{86844}Your boldness has saved our people,|Your Majesty.
{86847}{86904}It's you who should be|congratulated.
{86907}{87001}Together we shall bring peace|and prosperity to the Republic.
{87122}{87228}Confer on you the level|of Jedi knight the council does.
{87231}{87344}But agree with your taking this boy|as your Padawan learner...
{87347}{87392}I do not.
{87395}{87445}Qui-Gon believed in him.
{87515}{87579}The chosen one the boy may be.
{87582}{87621}Nevertheless...
{87624}{87693}grave danger I fear|in his training.
{87696}{87795}Master Yoda,|I gave Qui-Gon my word .
{87798}{87844}I will train Anakin.
{87898}{87954}Without the approval|of the council, if I must.
{87957}{88016}Qui-Gon's defiance|I sense in you.
{88019}{88065}Need that you do not.
{88119}{88197}Agree with you the council does.
{88224}{88303}Your apprentice Skywalker will be.
{88970}{89012}What will happen to me now?
{89015}{89088}The council have granted me|permission to train you.
{89091}{89173}You will be a Jedi, I promise.
{89399}{89480}There's no doubt|the mysterious warrior was a Sith.
{89483}{89542}Always two there are.
{89545}{89622}No more, no less.
{89625}{89695}A master and an apprentice.
{89698}{89735}But which was destroyed?
{89738}{89809}The master or the apprentice?
{90400}{90449}Hidoe, everybody!
{91567}{91613}Peace!
