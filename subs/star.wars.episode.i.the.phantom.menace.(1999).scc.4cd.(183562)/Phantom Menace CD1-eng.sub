{2855}{2907}- Captain.|- Yes, sir?
{2910}{2961}Tell them we wish|to board at once.
{2997}{3031}With all due respect...
{3034}{3111}the ambassadors for the supreme|chancellor wish to board immediately.
{3114}{3159}Yes, of course.
{3162}{3236}As you know,|our blockade is perfectly legal...
{3239}{3337}and we'd be happy|to receive the ambassadors.
{3876}{3939}I'm TC-14 at your service.
{3942}{3987}This way, please.
{4134}{4207}We are greatly honoured|by your visit, Ambassadors.
{4210}{4255}Make yourselves comfortable.
{4258}{4314}My master|will be with you shortly.
{4407}{4462}I have a bad feeling about this.
{4465}{4537}- I don't sense anything.|- It's not about the mission, Master.
{4540}{4634}It's something elsewhere, elusive.
{4637}{4694}Don't centre on your anxieties,|Obi-Wan.
{4697}{4772}Keep your concentration here and now,|where it belongs.
{4775}{4843}But Master Yoda said|I should be mindful of the future.
{4846}{4894}But not at the expense|of the moment.
{4897}{4967}Be mindful of the living Force,|young Padawan.
{4970}{5016}Yes, Master.
{5069}{5156}How do you think this trade viceroy|will deal with the chancellor's demands?
{5159}{5210}These Federation types are cowards.
{5213}{5281}The negotiations will be short.
{5302}{5363}What? What did you say?
{5366}{5437}The ambassadors are Jedi knights,|I believe.
{5455}{5484}I knew it.
{5487}{5541}They're here to force a settlement.
{5573}{5647}Distract them.|I will contact Lord Sidious.
{5650}{5688}Are you brain-dead?
{5691}{5759}I'm not going in there|with two Jedi.
{5799}{5833}Send a droid.
{5964}{6009}Is it in their nature|to make us wait this long?
{6012}{6067}No. I sense|an unusual amount of fear...
{6070}{6121}for something as trivial|as this trade dispute.
{6383}{6428}What is it?
{6431}{6495}This scheme of yours has failed,|Lord Sidious.
{6498}{6583}The blockade is finished.|We dare not go against these Jedi.
{6586}{6701}Viceroy, I don't want|this stunted slime in my sight again.
{6734}{6831}This turn of events is unfortunate.|We must accelerate our plans.
{6834}{6895}Begin landing your troops.
{6898}{6987}My lord, is that legal?
{6990}{7045}I will make it legal.
{7048}{7103}And the Jedi?
{7106}{7166}The chancellor should never have|brought them into this.
{7169}{7211}Kill them immediately.
{7214}{7317}Yes, my lord .|As you wish.
{7362}{7405}Captain, look!
{7432}{7465}Shields--
{7549}{7594}Sorry.
{7636}{7681}Dioxis.
{7798}{7860}They must be dead by now.
{7863}{7927}Destroy what's left of them.
{8122}{8179}Oh! Excuse me.
{8182}{8253}-Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.|-Roger, roger.
{8276}{8316}Uh-oh. Blast them.
{8454}{8491}What is going on down there?
{8494}{8541}We lost the transmission, sir.
{8649}{8721}Have you ever encountered|a Jedi knight before, sir?
{8724}{8795}Well, no, but I don't--|Seal off the bridge.
{8798}{8863}- Yes, sir.|- That won't be enough, sir.
{8866}{8913}I want droidekas|up here at once!
{8916}{8977}We will not survive this.
{9254}{9288}Close the blast doors!
{9447}{9499}That will hold them.
{9702}{9767}They are still coming through.
{9770}{9816}This is impossible!
{9924}{9992}Where are those droidekas?
{10030}{10072}Master! Destroyers!
{10226}{10259}They have shield generators!
{10294}{10359}It's a standoff.|Let's go.
{10459}{10519}They're no match for droidekas.
{10522}{10562}Sir!
{10565}{10629}They've gone up|the ventilation shaft.
{10840}{10904}- Battle droids.|- It's an invasion army.
{10946}{11010}This is an odd play|for the Trade Federation.
{11013}{11087}We've got to warn the Naboo|and contact Chancellor Valorum.
{11090}{11127}Let's split up.
{11130}{11207}Stow aboard separate ships|and meet down on the planet.
{11210}{11254}You were right|about one thing, Master.
{11301}{11365}The negotiations were short.
{11393}{11451}Sir, a transmission|from the planet.
{11454}{11504}It's Queen Amidala herself.
{11507}{11565}At last we are getting results.
{11598}{11670}Again you come before us,|Your Highness.
{11673}{11747}You will not be so pleased when you hear|what I have to say, Viceroy.
{11750}{11839}Your trade boycott|of our planet has ended.
{11842}{11903}I was not aware of such failure.
{11906}{11971}I have word that the chancellor's|ambassadors are with you now...
{11974}{12039}and that you have been commanded|to reach settlement.
{12042}{12096}I know nothing|of any ambassadors.
{12099}{12156}You must be mistaken.
{12159}{12207}Beware, Viceroy.
{12210}{12275}The Federation|has gone too far this time.
{12278}{12375}We would never do anything|without the approval of the senate.
{12378}{12438}You assume too much.
{12441}{12474}We will see.
{12513}{12609}- She's right. The senate will never--|- It's too late now.
{12612}{12683}- Do you think she suspects an attack?|- I don't know.
{12686}{12790}But we must move quickly to disrupt|all communications down there.
{12922}{13012}Negotiations haven 't started|because the ambassadors aren't there?
{13015}{13067}How could that be true?
{13070}{13174}I have assurances from the chancellor|his ambassadors did arrive.
{13177}{13267}It must-- handiwork--|negotiate-- ambassadors--
{13270}{13333}- nobody would--|- Senator Palpatine.
{13336}{13381}What's happening?
{13384}{13429}Check the transmission generator.
{13432}{13548}A communications disruption|can mean only one thing: invasion.
{13551}{13606}The Federation|would not dare go that far.
{13609}{13700}The senate would revoke their trade|franchise, and they'd be finished.
{13703}{13771}We must continue to rely|on negotiation.
{13774}{13851}Negotiation?|We've lost all communications.
{13854}{13910}And where are|the chancellor's ambassadors?
{13942}{14001}This is a dangerous situation,|Your Highness.
{14004}{14054}Our security volunteers|will be no match...
{14057}{14108}against a battle-hardened|Federation army.
{14146}{14235}I will not condone a course of action|that will lead us to war.
{15109}{15183}- Yes, Viceroy?|- Captain, we've searched the ship...
{15186}{15237}and there is no trace of the Jedi.
{15240}{15306}They may have gotten on|one of your landing craft.
{15309}{15368}If they're down here, sir,|we'll find them.
{15371}{15475}Use caution.|These Jedi are not to be underestimated.
{15806}{15849}- Oh, no!|- Get away! Get out of here!
{15871}{15917}Get down!
{16157}{16226}Was'n dat?|Hey, wait!
{16248}{16290}Oh, mooie-mooie,|I love you.
{16293}{16342}You almost got us killed.|Are you brainless?
{16345}{16384}I spake.
{16387}{16438}The ability to speak|does not make you intelligent.
{16441}{16510}- Now, get out of here.|- No, no, mesa stay.
{16513}{16586}Mesa culled JarJar Binks.|Mesa your humble servant.
{16589}{16639}- That won't be necessary.|- Oh, but it'tis.
{16642}{16711}'Tis demanded by the gods, it'tis.
{16714}{16760}- Oh, no!|- Stay down!
{16960}{17002}You saved my again.
{17005}{17050}- What's this?|- A local.
{17053}{17114}Let's get out of here|before more droids show up.
{17117}{17198}More?|"More" did you spake?
{17201}{17318}Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest|safest place would be Gunga City.
{17321}{17398}Is where I grew up.|'Tis a hidden city.
{17437}{17482}- A city?|- Uh-huh.
{17485}{17528}Can you take us there?
{17541}{17584}On second thought, no.
{17587}{17647}- Not really, no.|- No?
{17650}{17701}'Tis embarrassing...
{17704}{17799}but my afraid|my've been banished.
{17802}{17876}My forgotten. Da bosses|would do terrible tings to me.
{17879}{17952}Terrible tings to me|if me goen back dare.
{17955}{18027}- You hear that?|- Yah.
{18030}{18120}That is the sound of a thousand|terrible things heading this way.
{18123}{18185}If they find us,|they will crush us...
{18188}{18297}grind us into tiny pieces|and blast us into oblivion.
{18300}{18341}Oh.

{27038}{27110}I have the senate|bogged down in procedures.
{27113}{27219}They will have no choice but|to accept your control of the system.
{27222}{27335}The queen has great faith|that the senate will side with her.
{27338}{27409}Queen Amidala is young and naive.
{27412}{27495}You will find controlling her|will not be difficult.
{27498}{27543}Yes, my lord .
{27578}{27647}You didn't tell him|about the missing Jedi.
{27650}{27758}No need to report that to him|until we have something to report.
{27866}{27955}- Where wesa goin?|- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.
{27958}{28025}Oh, maxi big, da Force.

{28676}{28731}Power's back.
{28734}{28784}Monster's back!
{28972}{29014}Relax.
{29017}{29052}You overdid it.
{29454}{29503}Head for that outcropping.
{29506}{29552}Oh, boy.
{30399}{30449}Viceroy, we have captured the queen.
{30452}{30516}Ah, victory.
{30840}{30892}Dis'n loverly.
{31040}{31096}How will you explain this invasion|to the senate?
{31099}{31199}The queen and I will sign a treaty that|will legitimize our occupation here.
{31202}{31278}I have assurances|it will be ratified by the senate.
{31281}{31364}- I will not cooperate.|- Now, now, Your Highness.
{31367}{31466}In time, your people's suffering will|persuade you to see our point of view.
{31498}{31544}- Commander.|- Yes, sir.
{31547}{31586}Process them.
{31589}{31632}Captain, take them to Camp 4.
{31635}{31674}Roger, roger.
{32990}{33043}We should leave the street,|Your Highness.
{33046}{33085}Get their weapons.
{33129}{33183}Yousa guys bombad!
{33222}{33279}We're ambassadors|for the supreme chancellor.
{33282}{33327}Your negotiations seemed|to have failed, Ambassador.
{33330}{33374}The negotiations|never took place.
{33377}{33434}It's urgent that we make contact|with the Republic.
{33437}{33487}They've knocked out|all our communications.
{33490}{33570}- Do you have transports?|- In the main hangar. This way.
{33689}{33763}- There are too many of them.|- That won't be a problem.
{33766}{33851}Your Highness, under the circumstances,|I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.
{33854}{33927}Thank you, Ambassador,|but my place is with my people.
{33930}{33995}- They will kill you if you stay.|- They wouldn't dare.
{33998}{34047}They need her to sign a treaty|to make this invasion legal.
{34050}{34087}They can't afford to kill her.
{34090}{34141}There is something else behind all this,|Your Highness.
{34144}{34191}There's no logic|in the Federation's move here.
{34194}{34241}My feelings tell me|they will destroy you.
{34244}{34301}Our only hope is for the senate|to side with us.
{34304}{34363}Senator Palpatine|will need your help.
{34366}{34461}Either choice presents great danger...|to us all.
{34464}{34509}We are brave, Your Highness.
{34512}{34590}If you are to leave,|Your Highness, it must be now.
{34593}{34652}Then I will plead our case|to the senate.
{34677}{34720}Be careful, Governor.
{34934}{34984}We'll need to free those pilots.
{35014}{35059}I'll deal with that.
{35142}{35167}Halt.
{35170}{35210}I'm ambassador|to the supreme chancellor.
{35213}{35251}I'm taking these people to Coruscant.
{35254}{35331}- Where are you taking them?|- To Coruscant.
{35334}{35397}Coruscant?|Uh, that doesn't compute.
{35400}{35446}Uh, wait.|Uh, you're under arrest.
{35577}{35606}Come on. Move!
{35735}{35758}Go!
{36371}{36450}Now, stay here|and keep out of trouble.
{36541}{36593}Hello, boyos.
{36745}{36784}There's the blockade.
{37034}{37073}The shield generator's been hit!
{37277}{37315}How wude!
{37555}{37593}We're losing droids fast.
{37613}{37676}If we can't get the shield generator|fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.
{37728}{37758}The shields are gone.
{37953}{37985}The power's back!
{38052}{38135}That little droid did it.|He bypassed the main power drive.
{38138}{38200}Deflector shields up at maximum.
{38430}{38519}There's not enough power to get us|to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.
{38522}{38591}We'll have to land somewhere|to refuel and repair the ship.
{38594}{38646}Here, Master.|Tatooine.
{38649}{38689}It's small, out of the way, poor.
{38692}{38734}The Trade Federation|have no presence there.
{38737}{38782}How can you be sure?
{38785}{38831}It's controlled by the Hutts.
{38834}{38901}You can't take Her Royal Highness there.|The Hutts are gangsters.
{38904}{38959}- If they discovered her--|- It'd be no different than landing...
{38962}{39007}on a system controlled|by the Federation...
{39010}{39060}except that the Hutts|aren't looking for her...
{39063}{39113}which gives us the advantage.
{39220}{39292}And Queen Amidala,|has she signed the treaty?
{39295}{39382}She has disappeared, my lord .
{39385}{39485}One Naboo cruiser|got past the blockade.
{39501}{39558}I want that treaty signed.
{39561}{39610}My lord...
{39613}{39674}it's impossible to locate the ship.
{39677}{39730}It's out of our range.
{39733}{39787}Not for a Sith.
{39801}{39846}This is my apprentice...
{39849}{39895}Darth Maul.
{39927}{40006}He will find your lost ship.
{40110}{40165}This is getting out of hand.
{40168}{40217}Now there are two of them.
{40220}{40292}We should not|have made this bargain.
{40419}{40504}An extremely well-put-together|little droid, Your Highness.
{40507}{40576}Without a doubt, it saved the ship,|as well as our lives.
{40579}{40659}It is to be commended.|What is its number?
{40723}{40774}R2-D2, Your Highness.
{40777}{40811}Thank you, R2-D2.
{40902}{40936}PadmÈ.
{40973}{41024}Clean this droid up|as best you can.
{41027}{41074}It deserves our gratitude.
{41117}{41154}Continue, Captain.
{41225}{41269}Your Highness,|with your permission...
{41272}{41338}we're heading for a remote planet|called Tatooine.
{41341}{41421}It's in a system far beyond the reach|of the Trade Federation.
{41424}{41486}I do not agree|with the Jedi on this.
{41489}{41559}You must trust my judgment,|Your Highness.
{41641}{41682}Hello.
{41685}{41756}Sorry. Husa are yousa?
{41784}{41818}I'm PadmÈ.
{41845}{41893}Mesa JarJar Binks.
{41913}{41944}You're a Gungan, aren't you?
{41999}{42085}- How'd you end up here with us?|- My no know.
{42088}{42176}Mesa day starten pitty okeyday|witda brisky morning munchen.
{42179}{42246}Den boom!|Getten berry scared...
{42249}{42328}and grabben dat Jedi, and pow--|mesa here.
{42361}{42421}Mesa getten|berry, berry scared.
{42572}{42646}- That's it-- Tatooine.|- There's a settlement.
{42649}{42747}Land near the outskirts.|We don't want to attract attention.
{43161}{43228}The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.|We'll need a new one.
{43231}{43290}That'll complicate things.|Be wary.
{43293}{43368}- I sense a disturbance in the Force.|- I feel it also, Master.
{43371}{43420}Don't let them send|any transmissions.
{43566}{43624}The sun doen murder to mesa skin.
{43627}{43663}Wait!
{43689}{43723}Wait.
{43805}{43874}Her Highness commands you|to take her handmaiden with you.
{43877}{43967}No more commands|from Her Highness today, Captain.
{43970}{44020}The spaceport|is not going to be pleasant.
{44023}{44074}The queen wishes it.
{44077}{44123}She's curious about the planet.
{44185}{44258}This is not a good idea.|Stay close to me.
{44589}{44657}Moisture farms,|for the most part.
{44688}{44777}Some indigenous tribes|and scavengers.
{44780}{44825}The few spaceports like this one...
{44828}{44883}are havens for those|that don't wish to be found.
{44886}{44932}Like us.
{44964}{45031}Dissen berry, berry bad.
{45064}{45105}Icky, icky goo!
{45417}{45475}We'll try one of the smaller dealers.
{45612}{45657}Good day to you.
{45697}{45730}What do you want?
{45733}{45807}I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.
{45810}{45907}Ah, yes! Nubian.|We have lots of that.
{45925}{45970}Boy, get in here now!
{45973}{46018}My droid has a readout of what I need.
{46081}{46121}What took you so long?
{46141}{46174}I was cleaning the fan switches.
{46177}{46243}Watch the store.|I've got some selling to do.
{46246}{46324}So, let me take thee out back, huh?
{46327}{46372}We'll find what you need.
{46432}{46473}Don't touch anything.
{46721}{46790}- Are you an angel?|- What?
{46793}{46882}An angel. I heard the deep space|pilots talk about them.
{46885}{46954}They're the most beautiful|creatures in the universe.
{46957}{47019}They live on the moons of lego,|I think.
{47038}{47126}You're a funny little boy.|How do you know so much?
{47129}{47221}I listen to all the traders|and star pilots who come through here.
{47224}{47327}I'm a pilot, you know, and someday|I'm gonna fly away from this place.
{47330}{47425}- You're a pilot?|- Mm-hmm. All my life.
{47428}{47483}How long have you been here?
{47486}{47582}Since I was very little.|Three, I think.
{47585}{47650}My mom and I were sold|to Gardulla the Hutt...
{47653}{47718}but she lost us|betting on the Podraces.
{47721}{47764}You're a slave?
{47767}{47866}- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.|- I'm sorry.
{47869}{47959}I don't fully understand.|This is a strange place to me.
{48257}{48294}- I got ya.|- Hey!
{48297}{48339}Hit the nose.
{48451}{48536}A T-14 hyperdrive generator.|Thee in luck.
{48539}{48602}I'm the only one hereabouts|who has one.
{48605}{48689}But thee might as well buy a new ship.|It would be cheaper, I think, huh.
{48729}{48762}Saying of which...
{48765}{48822}how's thee gonna pay|for all this, huh?
{48825}{48874}I have 20,000 Republic dataries.
{48877}{48921}Republic credits?
{48924}{48994}Republic credits are no good out here.|I need something more real.
{48997}{49072}I don't have anything else,|but credits will do fine.
{49075}{49162}- No, they won't.|- Credits will do fine.
{49165}{49209}No, they won't!
{49212}{49312}What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,|waving your hand around like that?
{49315}{49417}I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks|don't work on me. Only money.
{49437}{49518}No money, no parts, no deal.
{49521}{49630}And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,|I promise you that.
{49795}{49897}Wouldn't have lasted long anyways|if I wasn't so good at building things.
{49987}{50032}We're leaving. JarJar.
{50095}{50156}I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.
{50159}{50203}I was glad to meet you too.
{50404}{50513}Outlanders.|They think we know nothing.
{50516}{50562}They seemed nice to me.
{50565}{50611}Clean the racks.
{50614}{50646}Then you can go home.
{50649}{50692}Yippee!
{50837}{50894}And you're sure there 's|nothing left on board?
{50897}{50942}A few containers of supplies.
{50945}{51018}The queen's ward robe, maybe,|but not enough for you to barter with...
{51021}{51077}not in the amount|you're talking about.
{51080}{51150}All right. I'm sure|another solution will present itself.
{51153}{51186}I'll check back later.
{51205}{51245}Noah gain. Noah gain.
{51248}{51316}Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!
{51319}{51378}Wesa be wobbed un crunched.
{51381}{51457}Not likely. We have nothing of value.|That's our problem.
{51823}{51857}Are you going to pay for that?
{51905}{51950}It costs seven wupiupi.
{52077}{52109}Oops.
{52217}{52262}Is this yours?
{52265}{52307}Who, mesa--
{52407}{52458}Careful, Sebulba.
{52461}{52509}He's a big-time outlander.
{52512}{52597}I'd hate to see you diced|before we race again.
{52600}{52693}Next time we race, boy,|it will be the end of you.
{52696}{52769}If you weren't a slave,|I'd squash you now.
{52786}{52854}Yeah, it'd be a pity|if you had to pay for me.
{52881}{52956}- Hi.|- Hi there.
{52959}{53002}Your buddy here was|about to be turned into orange goo.
{53005}{53050}He picked a fight with a Dug...
{53053}{53113}an especially dangerous Dug|called Sebulba.
{53116}{53202}Mesa haten crunchen.|Das da las ting mesa want.
{53205}{53301}Nevertheless, the boy is right.|You were heading into trouble.
{53314}{53349}Thanks, my young friend.
{53404}{53449}But mesa doen nutten!
{53653}{53715}This storm will slow them down.
{53718}{53754}Looks pretty bad.
{53786}{53846}- Panaka.|- Receiving a message from home.
{53849}{53892}We'll be right there.
{54046}{54098}Here, you'll like these pallies.
{54101}{54163}- Here.|- Thank you.
{54191}{54246}My bones are aching.
{54249}{54358}Storm's coming up, Ani.|You better get home quick.
{54361}{54429}- Do you have shelter?|- We'll head back to our ship.
{54432}{54494}- Is it far?|- It's on the outskirts.
{54497}{54554}You'll never reach|the outskirts in time.
{54557}{54650}Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.
{54653}{54712}Come on.|I'll take you to my place.
{55065}{55094}Mom!
{55097}{55186}- Mom, I'm home!|- Ah, dissen cosy.
{55189}{55246}- These are my friends, Mom.|- Hello.
{55249}{55334}- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.|- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?
{55337}{55394}Your son was kind enough|to offer us shelter.
{55397}{55444}Come on. I'll show you 3PO.
{55679}{55757}Isn't he great?|He's not finished yet.
{55760}{55791}He's wonderful.
{55821}{55862}You really like him?
{55865}{55935}He's a protocol droid|to help Mom. Watch.
{56041}{56072}Where is everybody?
{56075}{56103}Whoops.
{56180}{56208}Oh, hello.
{56211}{56290}I am C-3PO,|human cyborg relations.
{56293}{56338}How might I serve you?
{56341}{56408}- He's perfect.|- Oh. Perfect.
{56411}{56496}When the storm is over, I'll show you|my racer. I'm building a Podracer.
{56529}{56590}I'm not sure this floor|is entirely stable.
{56593}{56670}Hello. I don't believe|we have been introduced.
{56716}{56770}R2-D2.|A pleasure to meet you.
{56773}{56846}I am C-3PO,|human cyborg relations.
{56909}{56986}I beg your pardon,|but what do you mean, "naked"?
{57026}{57104}My parts are showing?|My goodness!
{57215}{57274}The death toll is catastrophic.
{57277}{57334}We must bow to their wishes.
{57337}{57386}You must contact me.
{57389}{57453}It's a trick.|Send no reply.
{57456}{57504}Send no transmissions of any kind.
{57559}{57628}It sounds like bait|to establish a connection trace.
{57631}{57726}What if it is true,|and the people are dying?
{57729}{57788}Either way,|we're running out of time.
{58115}{58166}Tatooine is sparsely populated.
{58169}{58236}If the trace was correct,|I will find them quickly, Master.
{58239}{58284}Move against the Jedi first.
{58287}{58352}You will then have no difficulty|in taking the queen to Naboo...
{58355}{58400}to sign the treaty.
{58403}{58455}At last we will reveal ourselves|to the Jedi.
{58458}{58516}At last we will have revenge.
{58519}{58588}You have been well-trained,|my young apprentice.
{58591}{58648}They will be no match for you.
{58765}{58861}All slaves have a transmitter|placed inside their bodies somewhere.
{58887}{58959}I've been working on a scanner|to try and locate mine.
{58962}{59046}- Any attempt to escape--|- And they blow you up!
{59068}{59106}How wude!
{59109}{59167}I can't believe|there's still slavery in the galaxy.
{59170}{59215}The Republic's antislavery laws--
{59218}{59274}The Republic doesn't exist out here.
{59277}{59329}We must survive on our own.
{59353}{59389}Xcuse me.
{59439}{59500}Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?
{59503}{59546}They have Podracing|on Malastare.
{59549}{59614}Very fast, very dangerous.
{59633}{59678}I'm the only human who can do it.
{59681}{59753}You must have Jedi reflexes|if you race pods.
{59780}{59813}Don't do that again.
{59944}{60006}You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?
{60077}{60146}- What makes you think that?|- I saw your laser sword .
{60149}{60218}Only Jedis carry|that kind of weapon.
{60221}{60296}Perhaps I killed a Jedi|and took it from him.
{60299}{60338}I don't think so.
{60341}{60393}No one can kill a Jedi.
{60413}{60462}I wish that were so.
{60465}{60514}I had a dream I was a Jedi.
{60517}{60593}I came back here|and freed all the slaves.
{60596}{60676}- Have you come to free us?|- No, I'm afraid not.
{60679}{60783}I think you have.|Why else would you be here?
{60900}{60966}I can see there's|no fooling you, Anakin.
{60969}{61041}We're on our way to Coruscant,|the central system in the Republic...
{61044}{61092}on a very important mission.
{61095}{61168}How did you end up out here|in the outer rim?
{61171}{61258}Our ship was damaged, and we're|stranded here until we can repair it.
{61288}{61365}I can help.|I can fix anything.
{61368}{61404}I believe you can.
{61407}{61474}But first we must acquire|the parts we need.
{61477}{61542}Wit no-nutten mula to trade.
{61545}{61630}These junk dealers|must have a weakness of some kind.
{61633}{61736}Gambling. Everything here revolves|around betting on those awful races.
{61739}{61769}Podracing.
{61772}{61842}Greed can be a powerful ally.
{61845}{61914}I built a racer.|It's the fastest ever.
{61917}{61972}There's a big race tomorrow|on Boonta Eve.
{61975}{62022}You could enter my pod.
{62045}{62118}- Anakin, Watto won't let you.|- Watto doesn't know I've built it.
{62121}{62166}You could make him think|it was yours...
{62169}{62222}and get him|to let me pilot it for you.
{62225}{62263}I don't want you to race.|It's awful.
{62266}{62326}I die every time|Watto makes you do it.
{62329}{62380}But, Mom, I love it.
{62383}{62468}The prize money would more than pay|for the parts they need.
{62471}{62526}Anakin.
{62529}{62595}Your mother's right.
{62598}{62672}Is there anyone friendly to the Republic|who can help us?
{62708}{62748}No.
{62870}{62981}Mom, you say the biggest problem in this|universe is nobody helps each other.
{63097}{63166}I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want|to put your son in danger.
{63169}{63215}We'll find some other way.
{63274}{63333}There is no other way.
{63336}{63440}I may not like it,|but he can help you.
{63461}{63506}He was meant to help you.
{63831}{63876}Are you sure about this?
{63879}{63942}Trusting our fate|to a boy we hardly know?
{63945}{63994}The queen will not approve.
{63997}{64042}The queen doesn't need to know.
{64069}{64108}Well, I don't approve.
{64135}{64198}The boy tells me you want|to sponsor him in the race.
{64201}{64240}How can you do this?
{64243}{64322}Not on the Republic credits,|I think.
{64325}{64377}My ship will be the entry fee.
{64389}{64430}Not bad!
{64433}{64504}Not bad, huh?|Nubian, huh?
{64507}{64586}It's in good order,|except for the parts I need.
{64589}{64649}What would the boy ride?
{64652}{64737}He smashed up my pod in the last race.|It would take some long time to fix it.
{64740}{64796}It wasn't my fault.|Really.
{64799}{64838}Sebulba flashed me with his vents.
{64841}{64922}I actually saved the pod, mostly.
{64949}{65008}That you did.
{65011}{65078}The boy's good.|No doubts there, huh?
{65081}{65141}I have acquired a pod|in a game of chance.
{65144}{65184}The fastest ever built.
{65187}{65310}I hope you didn't kill|anyone I know for it, huh?
{65357}{65442}So, you supply the pod|and the entry fee...
{65445}{65478}and I supply the boy.
{65481}{65574}We split the winnings 50-50,|I think, huh?
{65577}{65622}If it's going to be 50-50...
{65625}{65688}I suggest you front the cash|for the entry.
{65691}{65740}If we win...
{65743}{65834}you keep all the winnings,|minus the cost of the parts I need.
{65837}{65914}And if we lose,|you keep my ship.
{65973}{66007}Either way, you win.
{66146}{66178}Deal!
{66303}{66405}Your friend|is a foolish one, methinks.
{66596}{66666}What if this plan fails, Master?
{66669}{66734}We could be stuck here|a very long time.
{66737}{66798}Well, it 's too dangerous|to call for help...
{66801}{66882}and a ship without a power supply|isn't going to get us anywhere.
{66885}{66932}And...
{66935}{66980}there's something about this boy.
{67144}{67200}You should be very proud of your son.
{67218}{67274}He gives without any thought|of reward .
{67277}{67346}He knows nothing of greed.
{67349}{67375}He has--
{67399}{67444}He has special powers.
{67487}{67516}Yes.
{67519}{67582}He can see things|before they happen.
{67585}{67652}That's why he appears|to have such quick reflexes.
{67655}{67700}It's a Jedi trait.
{67703}{67770}He deserves better|than a slave's life.
{67773}{67854}Had he been born in the Republic,|we would have identified him early.
{67912}{68002}The Force is unusually strong with him.|That much is clear.
{68005}{68047}Who was his father?
{68112}{68158}There was no father.
{68193}{68273}I carried him,|I gave birth, I raised him.
{68294}{68354}I can't explain what happened.
{68394}{68437}Can you help him?
{68440}{68485}I don't know.
{68545}{68632}I didn't actually come here|to free slaves.
{68947}{68992}Wow, a real astro droid!
{69038}{69128}- How do you get so lucky?|- That isn't the half of it.
{69131}{69202}- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.|- What?
{69205}{69246}With this?
{69249}{69315}You're such a joker, Ani.
{69318}{69395}- You've been working on that for years.|- It's never gonna run.
{69398}{69450}Come on.|Let's go and play ball.
{69453}{69532}Keep racing, Ani.|You're gonna be bug squash.
{69737}{69794}Keep away from|those energy binders.
{69797}{69880}If your hand gets caught in the beam,|it's gonna go numb for hours.
{69883}{69916}Okay.
{70005}{70066}My tongue is fat.
{70069}{70143}My tongue-- Wrench.
{70146}{70210}Where is de wrench?|Oh, dare it is.
{70317}{70354}I'm stuck.
{70357}{70453}You know, I find that JarJar creature|to be a little odd.
{70497}{70565}You don't even know|if this thing's gonna run.
{70568}{70618}- It will.|- I think it's time we found out.
{70621}{70674}- Here, use this power charge.|- Yes, sir!
{70677}{70726}Come on, Kitster.|Let's move away.
{70729}{70782}My mouth.
{70785}{70817}Ani, I'm stuck.
{70942}{70994}My tongue is fat.
{70997}{71068}You're quite right.|He's very odd indeed.
{71121}{71170}Thank you.
{71173}{71207}Go.
{71555}{71642}It's working!|It's working!
{71897}{71957}Stay still, Ani.|Let me clean this cut.
{71960}{72054}There's so many.|Do they all have a system of planets?
{72057}{72102}Most of them.
{72105}{72152}Has anyone been to'em all?
{72193}{72222}Not likely.
{72249}{72302}I wanna be the first one|to see 'em all.
{72331}{72388}Ani, bedtime!
{72391}{72457}There we are.|Good as new.
{72460}{72529}Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.
{72532}{72614}- What are you doing?|- Checking your blood for infections.
{72617}{72654}Go on.
{72657}{72704}You have a big day tomorrow.
{72707}{72752}Sleep well, Ani.
{72818}{72866}- Obi-Wan?|- Yes, Master?
{72869}{72934}I need an analysis|of this blood sample I'm sending you.
{72937}{72978}Wait a minute.
{73019}{73066}I need a midi-chlorian count.
{73137}{73200}The reading is off the chart.
{73203}{73248}Over 20,000.
{73251}{73338}Even Master Yoda doesn't have|a midi-chlorian count that high.
{73341}{73384}No Jedi has.
{73387}{73436}What does that mean?
{73457}{73496}I'm not sure.
{75173}{75242}I wanna see your spaceship|the moment the race is over.
{75245}{75287}Patience, my blue friend.
{75290}{75344}You'll have your winnings|before the suns set.
{75347}{75390}And we'll be far away from here.
{75393}{75490}Not if your ship belongs to me,|I think, huh?
{75493}{75574}I warn you, no funny business.
{75577}{75652}- You don't think Anakin can win?|- Don't get me wrongo.
{75655}{75714}I have great faith in the boy.
{75717}{75768}He's a credit to your race...
{75771}{75848}but Sebulba there|is going to win, I think.
{75899}{75941}Oh, no!
{76041}{76085}Why do you think that?
{76088}{76133}He always wins!
{76181}{76240}I am betting heavily on Sebulba.
{76284}{76349}- I'll take that bet.|- What?
{76367}{76447}I'll wager my new racing pod|against, say...
{76450}{76495}the boy and his mother.
{76498}{76587}No pod is worth two slaves,|not by a long shot.
{76609}{76651}The boy, then.
{76800}{76860}We'll let fate decide, huh?
{76863}{76945}I just happen to have|a chance cube here.
{76948}{77021}Blue, it's the boy.
{77024}{77051}Red...
{77085}{77124}his mother.
{77357}{77415}You won this small toss,|outlander...
{77418}{77469}but you won't win the race!
{77472}{77522}So it makes little difference!
{77757}{77875}Better stop your friend's betting|or I'll end up owning him too.
{77965}{78025}- What'd he mean by that?|- I'll tell you later.
{78028}{78061}Good morning.
{78112}{78178}Oh, my.|Space travel sounds rather perilous.
{78228}{78324}I can assure you, they will never get me|onto one of those dreadful starships.
{78327}{78408}This is so wizard, Ani.|I'm sure you'll do it this time.
{78411}{78437}Do what?
{78440}{78513}Finish the race, of course.
{78516}{78558}You've never won a race?
{78561}{78626}Well, not exactly.
{78629}{78677}Not even finished?
{78680}{78739}Kitster's right.|I will this time.
{78742}{78791}Of course you will.
{79502}{79546}That's absolutely right.
{79549}{79670}And a big turnout here from all corners|of the outer rim territories.
{79673}{79760}I see the contestants are making|their way out onto the starting grid.
{79810}{79878}Isee Ben Quadinaros|from the Tund System.
{80014}{80073}Two-time winner Boles Roor.
{80134}{80177}Sebulba!
{80427}{80501}And in the front row,|nearside pole position...
{80504}{80552}Ma whonic!
{80581}{80630}A hearty hello...
{80633}{80722}to Clegg Holdfast|and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!
{80794}{80866}And back again,|it 's the mighty Dud Bolt...
{80869}{80979}with that incredible racing machine,|the Vulptereen 327.
{81059}{81114}And hoping for a big win today...
{81117}{81223}Ody Mandrell,|with his record-setting pit droid team.
{81340}{81418}And a late entry,|young Anakin Skywalker...
{81421}{81452}a local boy.
{81517}{81571}I see the flags are moving|out onto the track.
{82056}{82093}Be safe.
{82096}{82152}I will, Mom. I promise.
{82540}{82604}You won't walk away from this one...
{82607}{82661}you slave scum.
{82664}{82742}Don't count on it, slime ball.
{82745}{82802}You're bantha fodder!
{82912}{82965}- You all set, Ani?|- Yep.
{82968}{83007}Right.
{83106}{83169}Remember, concentrate|on the moment.
{83172}{83262}Feel, don't think.|Use your instincts.
{83265}{83304}I will.
{83307}{83360}May the Force be with you.
{83575}{83623}Jabba the Hutt.
{83868}{83974}Welcome.
{83997}{84075}Begin the race!
{84328}{84404}Hey, looks like|they're clearing the grid.
{84433}{84478}- Is he nervous?|- He's fine.
{84517}{84586}You Jedi are far too reckless.|The queen is not--
{84589}{84658}The queen trusts my judgment,|young handmaiden.
{84661}{84714}You should too.
{84717}{84767}You assume too much.
{84785}{84843}Start your engines.
{85785}{85865}Oh, dissen gonna be messy.|Me no watch'n!
{86345}{86376}Oh, no!
{86511}{86590}Wait.|Little Skywalker has stalled.
{86841}{86942}It looks like Quadinaros|is having engine trouble also.
{86980}{87011}Come on, Ani!
{87165}{87203}And there goes Skywalker!
{87206}{87241}Go, Ani, go!
{87244}{87295}He will be hard-pressed|to catch up with the leaders.
{89072}{89142}Looks like a few Tusken Raiders|are camped out...
{89145}{89200}on the canyon dune turn.
{89469}{89558}There goes Quadinaros'|power coupling.
{90223}{90276}Oh, no!
{90391}{90436}Where is Master Anakin?
{90514}{90567}Look. Here he comes.
{90636}{90692}It looks like Skywalker|is moving up in the field.
{90713}{90747}Yay! Yippee!
{90927}{91013}He has to complete|two more circuits? Oh, dear.
{92634}{92679}Skywalker's|spinning out of control!
{94068}{94163}I don't care what universe you're from.|That's gotta hurt!
{94332}{94373}Here he comes!
{94376}{94451}At the start of the third and final lap,|Sebulba 's in the lead...
{94454}{94514}followed closely by Skywalker!
{94517}{94538}Go, Ani!
{95186}{95242}Skywalker's been forced|onto the service ramp!
