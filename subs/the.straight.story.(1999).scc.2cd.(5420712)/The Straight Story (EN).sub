{8052}{8089}Alvin.
{8096}{8150}Alvin Straight!
{8156}{8270}Rose left a couple of hours ago.
{8276}{8388}Did you hear me hollerin' for|Rose? I wasn't lookin' for Rose.
{8394}{8500}- I haven't seen Alvin today.|- Did I ask?
{8506}{8586}Straight, you're late!
{8870}{8942}Alvin!
{9012}{9094}Alvin!
{9124}{9158}Alvin!
{9164}{9240}- Come in, Bud.|- What the... Alvin?!
{9276}{9326}Where the hell are you?
{9332}{9392}I can't see a thing.
{9398}{9476}Over here, Bud. Watch your step.
{9482}{9526}What the hell's going on?
{9532}{9628}What are you doin'|layin' on the floor? You nuts?
{9634}{9718}Supposed to be down|at Davmar's one hour ago.
{9724}{9756}What's going on?
{9762}{9822}Oh, my God!
{9828}{9860}Hey, Dorothy.
{9866}{9928}What's the number for 911?
{9934}{9998}- No, Dorothy.|- What you doin'?
{10004}{10098}I'll call the bar|and tell 'em we're not comin'.
{10104}{10192}Are you crazy?|We have a stricken man here.
{10198}{10254}Are you stricken, Alvin?
{10260}{10330}Put the phone down!
{10336}{10424}Dad, what's all the yellin'?
{10462}{10534}Wh-what... uh,|have you done to my dad?
{10540}{10582}Oh, for cry eye!
{10588}{10632}Dad?
{10638}{10682}Are you OK, Dad?
{10688}{10810}I just need a little help|gettin' up, honey.
{11482}{11554}I'm goin' to Davmar's.|I'll be right back.
{11560}{11626}OK, Bud.
{11848}{11876}I'm not goin'.
{11882}{11914}Dad.
{11920}{11944}I'm not goin'.
{11950}{12040}You promised me, Dad.
{12382}{12476}OK, Mr Straight,|put this robe on.
{12482}{12578}Just bring me the doctor.
{13186}{13272}You like birds.
{13298}{13405}I build... uh, birdhouses...|uh, for bluebirds.
{13412}{13470}Oh, that's nice.
{13476}{13568}Yeah, it's Pete... uh,|Pete sells my...
{13574}{13648}uh, birdhouses...|at the Ace Hardware.
{13654}{13740}- I'll look for them next time.|- Yeah?
{13746}{13796}No operation.
{13802}{13909}This morning you fall and can't|get up, that's your hips, Alvin.
{13914}{13964}And you'll need a walker now.
{13970}{14000}No walker.
{14005}{14072}Fine, a second cane, then.
{14077}{14127}You say you're having|trouble seeing.
{14134}{14192}That could be|a diabetes-related problem.
{14198}{14250}I'd like to run some tests.
{14256}{14328}No tests and no X-rays.
{14334}{14450}Well, I see and hear|that you smoke.
{14455}{14542}My guess is you're in the early|stages of emphysema.
{14548}{14610}And Alvin,|you have circulation problems
{14616}{14684}and I'm worried|about your diet.
{14690}{14777}If you don't|make some changes quickly,
{14784}{14880}there will be|some serious consequences.
{16046}{16110}It... has a... a red roof.
{16116}{16177}Another pretty one, Rose.
{16184}{16259}I want to... uh,|paint the... uh, next one blue.
{16264}{16340}That's a good idea.
{16494}{16610}What... uh, did the doctor say?
{16648}{16774}He said|I was gonna live to be 100.
{17598}{17672}I think I'll go|and mow the lawn.
{17678}{17750}Uh, I can... uh,|cut it for you, Dad.
{17756}{17832}I got it, sweetheart.
{18654}{18734}God darn!
{19186}{19290}No, we'll...|we won't be mowin' today.
{19296}{19366}Storm's comin' in.
{19372}{19406}Yeah.
{19648}{19688}I love a lightnin' storm.
{19694}{19772}Uh, me too, Dad.
{20284}{20354}Hello?
{20356}{20438}This is... is Rose.
{20444}{20550}Yeah... Yeah... Uh-huh.
{20556}{20612}Oh, no...
{20618}{20692}When?
{20694}{20758}OK... right... right...
{20764}{20804}I'll tell him.
{20810}{20930}Yeah... OK... Bye.
{21106}{21194}Uh, that was... Bobby.
{21200}{21276}Uncle Lyle... had a...
{21282}{21308}...a stroke.
{21500}{21576}Dad?
{22180}{22238}No, Bobby,|he... he didn't say much.
{22244}{22270}Uh, they've both...
{22276}{22300}uh, been so...
{22306}{22378}uh, stubborn.
{22386}{22442}No, no,|it was longer, I remember.
{22448}{22590}It was... uh, July, uh, 7th,|19... 88, uh, Bobby.
{22600}{22692}I always... remember the dates.
{22722}{22794}Yeah.
{22842}{22944}I don't know... uh,|what he'll do.
{24472}{24552}Rose, darlin'?
{24584}{24618}Rose?
{24624}{24700}I'm gonna go back on the road.
{24706}{24792}I've gotta go see Lyle.
{24828}{24896}But, Dad...
{24912}{24990}How are you...?
{25028}{25138}Well, I... haven't quite|got that figured yet.
{25500}{25554}One, your eyes are bad.
{25560}{25628}That's why you don't...|uh, drive your car.
{25634}{25726}Uh, two, Uncle Lyle...|uh, lives in... uh, Wisconsin,
{25732}{25814}which is... uh, 317 miles away.
{25820}{25914}You would have to... uh,|stay all night... in Des Moines.
{25920}{26012}Then there's no...|uh, bus... to Zion.
{26018}{26096}Three, your... uh, hips are bad.
{26102}{26154}You can hardly... uh, stand...
{26160}{26250}for two minutes... And|when you... uh, do stand up...
{26256}{26338}this... is the sound you make...
{26344}{26408}when you... stand.
{26602}{26706}Uh, four, uh,|you are... uh, 73 years old...
{26712}{26745}You were... uh, born
{26752}{26914}when, uh, Calvin... uh, Coolidge|was president... of America.
{26920}{27016}Uh, you are...|uh, 73 years old, Dad.
{27022}{27122}And... I cannot drive you there.
{27123}{27220}Rose, darlin', I'm not dead yet.
{27304}{27410}Uh, what are we...|uh, building, Dad?
{27428}{27464}Havin' a party?
{27470}{27558}Oh, jeez...|I love... uh, parties.

{27616}{27654}And so... where's it at?
{27660}{27690}Where's what at?
{27696}{27808}Your... uh, party.
{27824}{27877}I'm not havin' a party.
{27883}{27954}I thought|YOU were havin' a party.
{27960}{27992}I am?
{27998}{28072}Well, yeah.|Look at all that Braunschweiger.
{28078}{28139}Oh, yeah,|it's a lot of Braunschweiger.
{28145}{28212}It's... uh, for my dad,|uh, for his... his trip.
{28218}{28278}Uh, my dad...|he's going to... uh, Wisconsin.
{28284}{28366}I... asked him how|he's... uh, going to get there...
{28372}{28434}Uh... but he...|uh, won't say nothing.
{28439}{28534}Wisconsin?|That is a real party state.
{28539}{28611}Yeah.
{28612}{28723}I... uh, hate...|uh, Braun... uh... schweiger.
{28762}{28834}Yeah.
{29406}{29534}Alvin, you've got three|five-gallon cans there.
{29550}{29606}15 gallons of gas.
{29612}{29692}What do you need|so much gas for, Alvin?
{29698}{29778}Sig, you're one nosey|son of a gun.
{29784}{29844}You got that right.
{29850}{29932}- I wanna buy that.|- What?
{29938}{30012}The grabber.
{30127}{30167}Oh, jeez, Alvin.
{30173}{30298}- That's MY grabber, Alvin.|- Well?
{30364}{30506}Oh, jeez, Alvin. I don't...|I... I do have two of them...
{30512}{30564}I think five dollars is right.
{30570}{30673}That's a darn good grabber,|Alvin.
{30680}{30714}- I... I...|- Well?
{30720}{30774}They're hard to come by, Alvin.
{30780}{30934}It's gonna take me two months|to get another one on order.
{31098}{31170}Jeez, Alvin, ten dollars.
{31176}{31255}Ring her up.
{32072}{32167}What do you need|that grabber for, Alvin?
{32173}{32240}Grabbin'.
{33494}{33566}Oh, jeez, Dad.
{33574}{33666}Oh, jeez, Dad.
{34040}{34136}Listen to that|old grain elevator.
{34156}{34268}It's... uh, harvest time.
{34486}{34586}Uh, that... uh, trailer is too|h-heavy for... for that.
{34592}{34668}It's a lawn mower.|You're going to...
{34674}{34800}...drive a... a lawn mower|to another state?
{34884}{34984}Rosie, I've...|I've gotta go see Lyle.
{34990}{35086}And I... I've gotta make|this trip on my own.
{35092}{35194}I know you understand.
{35294}{35364}I guess so.
{35614}{35710}Look up at the sky, Rosie.
{35972}{36098}The sky is sure full|of stars tonight.
{36572}{36696}Crimenetto, it's Alvin|and he's driving his lawn mower.
{36856}{36956}Alvin! What are you settin' out|to do here?
{36962}{36994}For cry eye, Alvin!
{37000}{37078}Alvin, you're gonna get blown|right off the road,
{37084}{37158}that's what I'm afraid!
{37366}{37472}He'll never make it|past The Grotto.
{44664}{44718}I'm havin'|a little engine trouble.
{44724}{44796}What the heck is that|you're driving there?
{44802}{44916}It's a Rehds. Could you|give me a lift into town?
{44922}{45030}Yeah, to The Grotto. This|is the Sun Ray Tour. Get in.
{45036}{45182}- I'll get you help there.|- I'd appreciate that.
{45616}{45712}My Edward loved|his riding mower.
{46482}{46582}Hey, come here, hurry. Hurry up.
{46912}{46982}Poor Alvin.
{47160}{47274}So the man... in a... pick-up,|he brought my dad back.
{47280}{47420}Ohh... mm, I must've been|at the beauty shop.
{47462}{47538}What kinda pick-up?
{47962}{48038}A Ford.
{48046}{48116}But what's your dad doin'|with that gun?
{48122}{48202}I don't know.
{48380}{48456}I gave you that old Rehds|last time, right?
{48462}{48498}That you did.
{48504}{48632}- You tradin' in that Rehds now?|- No, I don't believe I will.
{48638}{48746}Pete told me you used that rider|in a real interestin' way.
{48752}{48838}- You still plannin' to do that?|- Yeah, Tom.
{48844}{48974}I know not to talk you out of|somethin' you set your mind to,
{48980}{49058}but Alvin, you've always|struck me as smart.
{49064}{49108}Well, that's appreciated.
{49114}{49148}Until now.
{49330}{49354}What year?
{49360}{49386}'66.
{49392}{49464}Kohler engine.|We've used it for parts
{49470}{49548}but I always replace them.|The guts are good.
{49554}{49642}It's got the old transmission.|Nothing fancy.
{49648}{49724}- Is it a good machine?|- It's good.
{49730}{49808}Tom, I got $325.
{49814}{49848}That's a fact.
{49854}{49956}Sounds good to me, Alvin.|Let's go settle up with Alice.
{49962}{50030}One more thing,|sometime you can find out
{50036}{50124}about these old machines,|if you know who run 'em.
{50130}{50228}- Do you know who owned it?|- You bet... Me.
{50234}{50300}All right.
{55309}{55404}I couldn't get a ride.
{55506}{55547}Are you hungry?
{55553}{55624}Whaddaya got?
{55630}{55706}Weeners.
{55726}{55762}Weeners?
{55768}{55872}Weeners. Wanna try one?
{56270}{56368}Here's a good stick for you.
{57244}{57286}What a hunk of junk.
{57292}{57391}Eat your dinner, missy.
{58644}{58753}So... how long you been|out on the road?
{58759}{58864}Well, I been travellin'|most of my life.
{58870}{58950}Where you from?
{58956}{59026}Laurens.
{59059}{59186}Got a wife back there? Kids?
{59190}{59312}My wife, Francis delivered|14 babies. Seven of 'em made it.
{59318}{59428}My daughter,|Rose lives with me.
{59472}{59572}Francis died in '81.
{59726}{59818}Where's your family?
{59891}{59972}Are you runnin' away?
{60162}{60247}How far along are ya?
{60322}{60403}Five months.
{60712}{60828}Well, I'm headin'|to see my brother Lyle.
{60864}{60894}Huh?
{60900}{61053}I said I'm goin' to see|my brother Lyle in Mount Zion.
{61056}{61122}- Where's that?|- Wisconsin.
{61128}{61203}- Oh...|- Just across the state line.
{61209}{61234}Cheddar Heads.
{61270}{61312}Aren't those the dumbest things
{61318}{61396}you ever seen somebody|stick on their head?
{61402}{61538}I hear that's|a real party place - Wisconsin.
{61618}{61726}Guess I'll never|get to find out.
{61859}{61924}There's a blanket|in the trailer.
{61930}{62036}Why don't you go get it?
{63116}{63204}My family hates me.
{63278}{63398}They'll really hate me|when they find out.
{63440}{63484}You didn't tell 'em?
{63491}{63606}No. No one knows.|Not even my boyfriend.
{63804}{63864}Well, they may be mad,
{63870}{63970}but I don't think they're|mad enough to wanna lose you
{63976}{64038}or your little problem.
{64044}{64092}I don't know about that.
{64098}{64216}Well, of course, neither do I,|but a warm bed and a roof
{64222}{64330}sounds a might better|than eatin' a hot dog on a stick
{64336}{64462}with an old geezer that's|travellin' on a lawn mower.
{64636}{64694}My daughter Rose is...
{64700}{64800}Some people call her|a little bit slow but she's not.
{64806}{64956}She's got a mind|like a bear trap for facts.
{64964}{65074}She keeps everything|organised around the house.
{65080}{65134}She was a real good mom.
{65141}{65206}She had four kids.
{65212}{65336}One night, somebody else|was watchin' the kids
{65341}{65418}and there was a fire.
{65424}{65522}Her second boy|got burned real bad.
{65528}{65606}Rose had nothin'|to do with it but, ah...
{65612}{65702}...on account of the way Rose is,|the State figured
{65708}{65786}she wasn't competent|to take care of them kids
{65792}{65866}and they took 'em all|away from her.
{65872}{66036}There isn't a day goes by that|she don't pine for them kids.
{66432}{66568}When my kids were real little,|I used to play a game with 'em.
{66574}{66652}I'd give each one|of 'em a stick and -
{66658}{66768}one for each one of 'em -|then I'd say "you break that".
{66774}{66828}'Course they could, real easy.
{66834}{66966}Then I'd say "tie them sticks in|a bundle and try to break that".
{66972}{67112}'Course they couldn't.|Then I'd say "that bundle...
{67118}{67188}...that's family."
{67552}{67612}Why don't you sleep|in the trailer?
{67618}{67722}This chair's just fine|for me tonight.
{67728}{67820}No, I'll be fine|sleepin' out here.
{67826}{67942}Lookin' at the stars|helps me think.
{67958}{68030}Well...
{68440}{68506}Thank you.
{72736}{72804}Woo!
{76116}{76184}What the...?
{76238}{76306}What the hell?
{76978}{77030}Hey, how're you doin'?
{77036}{77102}Doin' good.
{78126}{78156}Hey, Irene.
{78162}{78264}You don't think about|gettin' old when you're young.
{78270}{78346}You shouldn't.
{78532}{78596}Must be something good|about gettin' old.
{78602}{78752}Well, I can't imagine anything|good about being blind and lame
{78758}{78806}at the same time, but... still
{78812}{78946}at my age, I've seen about all|that life has to dish out.
{78952}{79022}I know to separate the wheat
{79028}{79186}from the chaff and let|the small stuff fall away.
{79232}{79308}Let's go, man.
{79328}{79456}So, ah... what's the worst part|about being old, Alvin?
{79474}{79648}The worst part of being old is|rememberin' when you was young.
{82484}{82528}Can I help you, lady?
{82534}{82632}No, you can't help me.|No one can help me.
{82638}{82738}I've tried driving with my|lights on, sounding my horn!
{82744}{82858}I scream, I roll the window down|and bang on the door
{82864}{82938}and play Public Enemy real loud!
{82944}{83032}I've prayed to St Francis|of Assisi, St Christopher too!
{83038}{83130}What the heck! I've tried|everything and still every week
{83136}{83188}I hit at least one deer!
{83194}{83338}I have hit 13 deer in seven|weeks driving down this road!
{83344}{83470}And I HAVE to drive|down this road every day,
{83476}{83530}40 miles to work and back.
{83536}{83720}I HAVE to drive to work|and I HAVE to drive home!
{83782}{83868}Where do they come from?
{84134}{84202}Oh... he's dead.
{84282}{84368}And I LOVE deer.
{87494}{87608}Well, they sure picked the right|place to practise a burn on.
{87936}{88072}That Rumelthanger place|was an eyesore.
{89110}{89164}What do you suppose...?
{89170}{89260}Is that a lawn mower?
{89976}{90062}Mister, you OK?
{90190}{90324}Jeez, mister, you're lucky|she didn't roll on you.
{90466}{90510}I guess the belt broke.
{90516}{90566}I wouldn't be surprised.
{90572}{90646}You don't have brakes|on that trailer, right?
{90652}{90720}I worked for John Deere|for 30 years,
{90726}{90814}you shouldn't be hauling a rig|behind a mower.
{90820}{90890}At least not down|a hill like that.
{90896}{90958}I'm Danny Riordan.
{90964}{91024}Alvin Straight.
{91030}{91134}Alvin, let's get you|and this rig off the road
{91140}{91246}and see what the damage is.
{91506}{91602}Let's get this off the road.
{91604}{91692}Sure you're OK?
{92536}{92592}OK.
{92598}{92698}You OK? Everything all right?|I'm going back to the exercise.
{92704}{92794}Thanks. Appreciate it.
{92904}{93016}Well... let's|take a look at this mower.
{93022}{93164}- This is what '65, '66?|- '66.
{93280}{93344}Well... tell you right now,|Alvin,
{93350}{93406}you won't be going|anywhere tonight.
{93412}{93482}Aside from your, ah,|drive belt being busted,
{93488}{93544}you got transmission problems.
{93550}{93626}- Where you headed?|- Mount Zion.
{93632}{93700}Mount Zion, Wisconsin?|Past Prairie du Chien?
{93706}{93760}That's 60 more miles of hills.
{93766}{93806}That's across the Mississippi.
{93812}{93864}What's in Mount Zion, Alvin?
{93870}{93908}My brother lives there.
{93914}{94014}- Why didn't you take your car?|- I'm not licensed.
{94020}{94114}- Couldn't he visit?|- He's had a bad stroke.
{94120}{94194}Where are you coming from?
{94200}{94238}Back a piece.
{94244}{94296}West Union?
{94302}{94382}- Hawkeye?|- Nope.
{94388}{94482}Well, not New Hampton?|You haven't come that far.
{94488}{94560}You've come a long ways,|haven't you?
{94566}{94636}Yeah, I have. Laurens, Iowa.
{94642}{94678}Laurens?!
{94684}{94804}That's west of The Grotto. How|long have you been on the road?
{94810}{94834}What's the date?
{94840}{94910}October eighth.
{94982}{95074}Five weeks. I left Laurens|on the fifth of September.
{95080}{95156}You been bunkin' in that?
{95162}{95226}That's my rollin' home.
{95232}{95278}Where you been settin' up camp?
{95284}{95390}In the fields. I pull off.|I don't travel at night.
{95396}{95448}Haven't you been scared,|being alone?
{95454}{95496}There are weird people|everywhere.
{95502}{95636}Well, ma'am, I fought|in the trenches in World War II.
{95642}{95716}Why should I be scared|of an Iowa cornfield?
{95722}{95794}Well, um...
{95800}{95894}till we get|this mower fixed...
{95898}{95978}why don't you... ah,|bivouac in our yard here?
{95984}{96062}There's a bathroom|in the garage you can use.
{96068}{96124}Well, that's|awful generous of you
{96130}{96272}and I'm sure my machine here|is agreeable to that too.
{96304}{96390}Sure wanna thank you folks|for helping me today.
{96396}{96450}There's a lot of rain forecast.
{96456}{96538}Sure don't want to get stuck|in that trailer.
{96544}{96648}I... I do a little woodwork.|I thought you'd like a few fish.
{96654}{96724}My daughter does woodwork.|She makes birdhouses.
{96730}{96806}Oh, that's nice.
{96926}{97052}- You finished there?|- I believe I am.
{99142}{99248}- I'm in need of a phone.|- Sure. Come in.
{99254}{99344}I wanna tell my daughter|about my recent travels.
{99350}{99384}Sure. Come in.
{99390}{99510}If it's all the same with you,|do you have a cordless phone?
{99516}{99668}- Door's wide open, come...|- I can call from out here.
{99850}{99950}Here you go. You're welcome|to sit in the kitchen.
{99956}{100032}We can leave, if you're|lookin' for privacy.
{100038}{100148}Out here's fine.|Is the area code still 712 here?
{100154}{100226}No, Alvin.|That hill rolled you into 319.
{100232}{100316}You need to dial one|and your area code.
{100322}{100392}712, thank you.
{100744}{100768}'Hello?'
{100774}{100798}Rose?
{100804}{100876}Dad? Dad...
{100908}{101002}Uh, I'm... so glad to hear you.
{101146}{101236}It's gonna cost him a bundle|to fix that mower.
{101242}{101324}I don't think|he's got that kinda money.
{101330}{101394}I wouldn't drive|that thing to Excelsior.
{101400}{101462}It's a lawn mower,|for God's sake.
{101468}{101578}Uh, your social security cheque?|Ah... it's here, Dad.
{101584}{101648}Rose, can you send me my cheque?
{101654}{101702}Uh, yeah.
{101708}{101790}He's damn lucky|he made it down that hill.
{101796}{101876}- He could've died easily.|- Yeah.
{101882}{101924}He's none too strong.
{101930}{102012}See how he has to walk|with the canes?
{102018}{102096}OK, Dad.
{102188}{102282}I... I...
{102306}{102416}OK, OK, Dad, OK.|I... I have a pencil, Dad.
{102422}{102482}The hills just get worse
{102488}{102594}the closer you get|to the Mississippi.
{102610}{102668}Go ahead and drive him, honey.
{102674}{102757}Mount Zion can't|be half a day. It's fine.
{102764}{102836}You're a good man,|Danny Riordan.
{102842}{102988}And that's why I married you,|despite what my mother said.
{103000}{103024}Now, shoo!
{103030}{103054}Dad?
{103060}{103128}I miss you, Dad.
{103134}{103170}I love you, Rosie.
{103176}{103220}'I love you too, Dad.'
{103226}{103294}Uh, bye, Dad.
{103300}{103343}Bye... Dad.
{103428}{103494}Ahem.
{104142}{104194}What are you cookin'|there, Alvin?
{104200}{104256}Oh, I'm makin'|my Mexican coffee.
{104262}{104318}Ah. Mind if I join you?
{104324}{104440}Get you a chair...|that iron one there.
{104476}{104592}You'll be a guest|in your own back yard.
{104614}{104750}Amm, I talked to the Olsen|twins, and, ah... they estimate
{104772}{104872}it'll cost around 250 dollars|to get your mower fixed.
{104878}{104948}Well, that's twice|what it oughta be,
{104954}{105018}I guess it's cos|they're twins, huh?
{105064}{105196}I'd be happy to drive you the|rest of the way to Mount Zion.
{105202}{105302}Be a nice Sunday drive.|We enjoy crossin' the river,
{105308}{105366}especially now|with the trees in colour.
{105372}{105431}Well, I appreciate that, but...
{105436}{105552}...I wanna finish this one|my own way.
{105800}{105872}Try this.
{105952}{106019}Thank you.
{106034}{106107}Well, you know, Alvin,|there's a lotta hills
{106114}{106176}bigger than Clairmont's|between here and Zion.
{106181}{106252}Even if you get that mower|runnin' again,
{106257}{106306}it may still break down.
{106312}{106414}Well, you're a kind man|talkin' to a stubborn man.
{106420}{106538}I still wanna finish this|the way I started.
{106600}{106656}No, no...
{106662}{106686}Hi, Verlyn.
{106692}{106764}- How the heck you doin'?|- Fine.
{106769}{106796}Wonderful.
{106802}{106874}He's there.
{107144}{107219}Well... they gave you|a plate of her brownies.
{107224}{107264}Yeah.
{107270}{107306}How's that for timing?
{107312}{107356}Janet makes the best brownies...
{107362}{107400}...in Lafayette county.
{107406}{107490}She won prizes every year|at the county fair.
{107496}{107594}- Mmm... help yourself.|- Thank you.
{107666}{107757}Mmm... I've been doin' errands|and I'm heading for a beer.
{107764}{107824}I thought you'd like|to join me.
{107831}{107881}Well, I don't drink|any more, but...
{107886}{107957}I'm always up for a change|of scenery.
{107964}{108031}Well, come on.
{108196}{108281}Well, I'm ridin' a little higher|and a little faster.
{108288}{108356}Except when you came down|that hill.
{108572}{108666}I picked up a mournful taste|for liquor in France.
{108672}{108757}When I came back,|I couldn't drink enough of it.
{108764}{108924}I wasn't worth a stick|of stove wood... I was mean.
{108956}{109020}A preacher helped me|put some distance
{109026}{109126}between me and the bottle.|And he helped me see...
{109131}{109242}the reason I was drinkin', I was|seein' all them things here,
{109248}{109334}that I'd seen over there.
{109434}{109550}# Though things may look very|dark, your dream is not... #
{109556}{109660}Lots of men came back|drinkin' hard.
{109690}{109790}Well... everyone|tryin' to forget.
{109796}{109922}I can see it|in a man right away.
{109954}{110000}Yup.
{110006}{110092}# The rainbow,|you will suddenly... #
{110420}{110496}There was one time...
{110516}{110592}when we just...
{110598}{110742}Were waiting for|the first warm meal in ten days.
{110874}{110968}We... thought|we'd seen the worst.
{111000}{111118}We hadn't had|much trouble from the air.
{111164}{111214}I was on the rise...
{111220}{111296}with the quartermaster,
{111302}{111428}workin' on more coffee|for me and my buddies.
{111445}{111546}A stray Fokker|came over the treetops...
{111552}{111634}and dropped|an incendiary on the mess tent.
{111676}{111752}All my buddies...
{111760}{111906}The Kraut banked right in front|of me on that hill...
{111916}{112028}and now I can...|see the... Swastika.
{112320}{112406}That is one thing|that I can't shake loose...
{112412}{112522}All my buddies faces|are still young.
{112554}{112686}And the thing is, the more years|I have, the more they've lost.
{112728}{112810}And it's not always buddies|faces that I see,
{112816}{112900}sometime they're German faces.
{112950}{113081}Near the end we were shootin'|moon-faced boys.
{113192}{113234}I was a sniper.
{113240}{113350}Where I grew up, you learned|how to shoot to hunt food.
{113356}{113520}They'd post me up front.|Darn near ahead of the lines.
{113548}{113628}And I'd sit... forever.
{113634}{113734}It's an amazing thing what you|can see while you're sittin'.
{113740}{113926}I'd look for the officers, the|radio guys or artillery spotter.
{113952}{114078}Sometime I'd spot|a gun nest by the smoke
{114084}{114145}and I'd fire into it.
{114152}{114280}Sometime it was just|a movement in the woods.
{114388}{114457}We had a scout,
{114464}{114522}a little fella...
{114528}{114594}name of Kotz.
{114614}{114722}He was a Polish boy|from Milwaukee.
{114762}{114864}He'd always take recon|and he was darn good at it.
{114870}{115038}We went by his word and he saved|our skin many a time.
{115056}{115148}He was a little fella...
{115266}{115362}We'd broken|out of the hedgerows...
{115364}{115460}We were makin'|a run across the open
{115466}{115562}and we come upon a woods.
{115574}{115655}We started drawin' fire.
{115668}{115752}I took my usual position...
{115757}{115886}and I saw somethin' movin',|real slow like.
{115898}{116069}I waited ten minutes,|it moved again and I shot.
{116069}{116150}The movement stopped.
{116164}{116314}The next day|we found Kotz... head shot.
{116318}{116444}He'd been workin'|his way back toward our lines.
{116455}{116604}Everyone in the unit thought|a German sniper had taken him...
{116636}{116722}Everyone, all these years.
{116744}{116820}Everyone but me.
{118156}{118198}Ha ha!
{118204}{118290}See, Harald... brainiac...
{118310}{118414}Got the mower assembly free with|this here little old wrench...
{118419}{118460}You said it wouldn't work.
{118466}{118586}I'd say it worked|pretty good. Wouldn't you?
{118640}{118786}So help me slide her out.|We can get settled up.
{119390}{119557}Uh... I got parts and labour|that add up to $247.80.
{119638}{119740}Well, I'd say that's a little|heavy for light work.
{119746}{119788}Don't you think?
{119794}{119869}I've got an old man's eyes,|but, ah...
{119874}{119940}I'm noticin' some new tyre here.
{119946}{120026}Well, now... ah,|we got those off a resell,
{120031}{120074}but the treads are good!
{120081}{120188}Well, friend, are you chargin'|me for good or for new?
{120194}{120305}Ahhhh... Thorvald?
{120305}{120378}Ahh... we can make|an adjustment there.
{120384}{120556}Well, I think the adjustment|should be about thirty dollars.
{120562}{120614}Is that what|your pencil's sayin'?
{120620}{120706}And, ah... about the labour...
{120731}{120844}I appreciate that you boys have|done some real time on this...
{120850}{120950}of course, a man's gotta ask|when he's workin' with twins -
{120956}{121024}especially a bickerin' pair -
{121030}{121081}how much workin' was fightin'?
{121086}{121130}He got that right.
{121136}{121170}Shut up, Danny.
{121176}{121284}If I was to judge by this joyous|affair I saw today,
{121290}{121386}I would calculate maybe 20|per cent taken off the labour.
{121392}{121462}Anything else, mister?
{121478}{121594}Well, I'm not from these parts,|but where I come from,
{121600}{121710}I would say that that was a|little rich for Iowa oil.
{121716}{121774}Take the oil, no charge.
{121780}{121916}Well, that's a splendid offer|and I do appreciate it.
{121922}{121950}What's the tally?
{121956}{122048}Ah... ahhh...
{122190}{122231}Hundred and eighty even?
{122238}{122288}Done.
{122294}{122424}Thanks to you boys, I'm gonna|get this rig back on the road.
{122430}{122552}I've drove it all the way across|Iowa and I'm hopin' it holds on
{122557}{122644}till I get to Wisconsin.|My brother lives there.
{122650}{122719}I haven't seen him|in ten years.
{122724}{122786}There's no one|knows your life better
{122792}{122852}than a brother|that's near your age.
{122858}{122919}He knows who and what you are
{122924}{122996}better than anyone on Earth.
{123002}{123105}My brother and I said some...|unforgivable things
{123110}{123276}the last time we met, but, I'm|tryin' to put that behind me.
{123293}{123419}And this trip is a hard|swallow... of my pride,
{123440}{123542}I just hope I'm not too late.
{123714}{123812}A brother's a brother.
{124048}{124114}Well...
{124120}{124174}Guess I'll be turnin' in.
{124181}{124284}I'll, ah... see you in the|morning, then, before you go.
{124290}{124376}I'm gonna leave awful early.
{124816}{124914}I wanna thank you for your|kindness to a stranger.
{124919}{125012}It's been a genuine pleasure|havin' you here, Alvin.
{125019}{125057}Write to us, sometime.
{125064}{125130}I will.
{132002}{132046}I noticed your campfire.
{132052}{132162}I brought you some dinner...|Mashed potatoes, meat loaf.
{132168}{132240}Well, thank you kindly.|I've had my dinner,
{132246}{132316}but would you|join me for a while?
{132322}{132388}Sure.
{132526}{132592}Thank you.
{132758}{132822}I hope you don't|mind me trespassin'.
{132828}{132878}Oh, no, not at all.
{132884}{132916}Made a fine choice.
{132922}{133000}You're camped next to|one of the oldest cemeteries
{133006}{133096}in the Midwest.|French Catholic trappers.
{133102}{133228}- The Marquette party.|- Two of his men.
{133242}{133306}I couldn't help but notice
{133312}{133408}the rather unusual|mode of transport.
{133420}{133556}Well, you're not the first|person to notice that, Padre.
{133560}{133634}My eyes are bad. I can't drive.
{133640}{133708}I don't like someone else|drivin' the bus,
{133714}{133780}and I need to get|to my brother's.
{133786}{133810}Fair enough.
{133816}{133850}Where is he?
{133856}{133942}Well, he's so close,|I can practically feel him.
{133948}{133976}Mount Zion.
{133982}{134016}What's his name?
{134022}{134084}Lyle Straight.
{134090}{134256}Is he that fella that came in|with a stroke some weeks ago?
{134262}{134294}Do you know him?
{134300}{134370}I work at the hospital|in Boscobel.
{134376}{134420}I remember him comin' in.
{134426}{134498}Caught my attention|because... he lives in my parish.
{134504}{134534}Well, he's a Baptist.
{134540}{134638}Oh, I believe he told me that.
{134644}{134716}Told me a few things,|matter of fact,
{134722}{134786}but he didn't|mention having a brother.
{134792}{134988}Well, neither one of us has had|a brother for quite some time.
{135048}{135126}So, you saw him?|Is he all right?
{135132}{135298}I only saw him that once and|I haven't heard anything more.
{135566}{135690}Well, Lyle and I grew up|as close as brothers could be.
{135696}{135802}We were raised on a farm|in Moorhead, Minnesota.
{135808}{135934}We worked hard. My mom and dad|darn near killed themselves
{135940}{136012}tryin' to make that farm work.
{136018}{136164}And me and Lyle would|make games out of our chores.
{136168}{136258}We'd dream up somethin'|about racin' and wagerin'
{136264}{136352}do anything to keep|our mind off the cold.
{136358}{136390}Lord, it was cold.
{136396}{136506}He and I used|to sleep out in the yard
{136512}{136582}every summer night,|if it wasn't pourin'.
{136588}{136688}Nine months of winter,|we couldn't get enough summer.
{136694}{136768}We'd bunk down|when the sun went down.
{136774}{136882}We'd talk to each other|until we went to sleep.
{136888}{137022}We'd talk about the stars|and whether there might be
{137028}{137116}somebody else like us|out in space,
{137122}{137190}places we wanted to go and...
{137196}{137302}it made|our trials seem smaller.
{137316}{137452}Yeah, we pretty much talked|each other through growin' up.
{137530}{137684}Oh, whatever happened|between you two?
{137690}{137822}Story as old as the Bible.|Cain and Abel.
{137870}{137936}Anger, vanity.
{137976}{138058}You mix that together|with liquor, and...
{138064}{138226}you've got two brothers who|haven't spoken in ten years.
{138236}{138382}Well, whatever it was|that made me and Lyle so mad...
{138388}{138466}don't matter any more.
{138472}{138536}I wanna make peace.
{138542}{138612}I wanna sit with him,
{138618}{138686}look up at the stars...
{138692}{138762}like we used to do...
{138768}{138834}so long ago.
{138958}{138994}Well, sir...
{139000}{139110}I say "Amen" to that.
{140458}{140524}Howdy.
{140898}{140986}I haven't had a drink|in a lot of years.
{140992}{141050}Now I'm gonna have me a beer.
{141056}{141086}What flavour?
{141092}{141202}What does|a Miller's Lite taste like?
{141432}{141498}There you go.
{141596}{141660}- How's it taste?|- It's good.
{141666}{141728}- Keep the change.|- Thank you.
{141734}{141846}It's an interesting rig you got|outside. Get up the hill OK?
{141852}{141948}That hill and 200 more|just like it.
{141954}{141998}How far did ya come?
{142004}{142052}From Iowa.
{142058}{142110}I'm headed|for Lyle Straight's place.
{142116}{142202}Iowa! My God,|you must be thirsty.
{143304}{143328}Another beer?
{143334}{143374}This will do me fine.
{143380}{143458}I wonder could you point me|to Lyle's place?
{143464}{143542}I haven't seen him|in an awful long time.
{143548}{143650}Well, you just... ah,|cross 61 here, on "W",
{143656}{143772}Take "W" on down to Weed Road|and then on to Remington Road.
{143778}{143860}On your right|will be Lyle's place.
{143866}{143968}If he's there that is.
{147334}{147366}How you doin'...?
{147372}{147440}Not too good.
{147506}{147582}This thing's just tired.
{147684}{147768}Is there anything|I can do to help you?
{147774}{147858}Well, I don't know.|It just quit on me.
{147864}{147920}Why don't you try her again?
{147992}{148066}I'm headin'|to Lyle Straight's place.
{151096}{151178}Lyle!
{151242}{151312}Lyle?
{151512}{151582}Alvin?
{152522}{152608}Sit down, Alvin.
{153794}{153950}Did you ride that thing all|the way out here to see me?
{153956}{154026}I did, Lyle.
