00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,320
<i>So, we're really doing this, huh?</i>

3
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,930
<i>- Right now?</i>
<i>- Yup.</i>

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,207
<i>Okay, we got to present this properly.</i>

5
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,482
<i>- Where should I go?</i>
<i>- Come to the right.</i>

6
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,130
<i>- To the right?</i>
<i>- Come on.</i>

7
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,086
Okay?

8
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,370
Hi, my name is...

9
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,570
Hi. My name is David Raskin

10
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,405
and I'm applying for
the MIT Physics Fellowship.

11
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,286
What I've developed
is an intelligent propulsion experiment

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,203
which allows me to...

13
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,561
Um...

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,045
I think I'm getting into that too early.

15
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,640
I should talk about them more, right?

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,968
I first became interested
in the sciences, uh...

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,405
No, that was not the way to start.

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,643
- What if I walk at you like...
- Can you just go?

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,006
All right, watch.

20
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,681
Hi. My name is David Raskin.

21
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,489
Take it down,
like, four notches, Seacrest.

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,562
- What?
- Come on!

23
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,444
I'd like to introduce you to my engineers,

24
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,885
Adam Le and Quinn Goldberg,

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,889
and it's my sister, Christina Raskin,
behind the camera.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,001
Would you not...
Hold on one second.

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,167
I'll hold it so you can point...

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,481
- Dude, you're distracting him.
- What if it looks like you built it?

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,960
- Close your eyes.
- No, it's not gonna look like I built it.

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,725
All right. Like that?

31
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,969
Let's put this up, Chris.

32
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,008
Okay, the smartphone's
connected to the Wi-Fi. Ready.

33
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,525
Wait, wait, wait.

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,566
Beginning to lift the craft.

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,930
Take the controller.

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,249
I want you to notice
these marks on my fingers.

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,090
All right, cutting off power now.

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,284
Dude, you're getting into MIT!

39
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,846
These marks on my hand are read

40
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,651
by the modified motion sensor
on the computer.

41
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,848
It allows my hands to
manipulate this craft

42
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,160
with uncanny precision.

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,086
Oh!

44
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,765
That's nuts!

45
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,048
The motion sensors are routed
through my smart phone

46
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,567
with an 802.11g,
64 gigahertz wireless.

47
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,406
Chris, watch out. Coming your way.

48
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,965
- Whoo! Ta-da!
- Yes!

49
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,480
All right, let's take this thing
to its max altitude!

50
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,406
Come on, let's go!

51
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,561
- Oh, shit!
- Grab the computer.

52
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,005
Go, go, go!

53
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,044
Okay, so, unlike other static systems,

54
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,010
my algorithm tracks gestures
while the operator is moving.

55
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,482
Elevation, 140.
151, David. 170!

56
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,331
It should have a vertical reach
of about 250 feet.

57
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,805
What is that? ls that my phone?

58
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,849
David, I think I lost signal.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,126
What do you mean
you lost signal?

60
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,645
The call's interrupting the Wi-Fi.

61
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,325
Who could possibly
be calling you right now?

62
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,521
Everyone you know
is standing right here!

63
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,681
It's not connecting, David.

64
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,529
Guys, it's not responding!
It's not responding.

65
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,005
I don't see it anymore!

66
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,327
It's gone. It's dropping!

67
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,761
- Guys, run!
- Which way do I go?

68
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,569
- Which way?
- Go! Quinn, run!

69
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,290
Oh, shit!

70
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,963
The experiment
was a complete success.

71
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,805
Thank you for your consideration, MIT.

72
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,685
Christina, I need you
to put that laundry away.

73
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,531
Yes.
I will do it later, I promise.

74
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,005
David's daily ritual.

75
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,166
Checking for the letter, day 37.

76
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,484
Quinn. Yeah, it came.

77
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,449
No, I don't know if I got in yet,
but it's really...

78
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,567
It's big.

79
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,284
All right, well, come over then.
Come on!

80
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,691
Go show her.
David, go show her.

81
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,886
Christina, I need you
to put that laundry away.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,001
Yeah, lwill.

83
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,445
And I'm not gonna
tell you again. Oh, good.

84
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,760
- Can you see this stain here?
- No, Mom...

85
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,171
I got two job interviews today.

86
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,242
Mom, look, look. It came.

87
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,765
Oh, my God!

88
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,768
Christina, give me that.
It's a family moment.

89
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,689
Wait for me, wait for me!

90
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,360
I'm growing a beard, David. Open it.

91
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,522
- Shut up.
- Christina, be more supportive.

92
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,841
Okay, I want you to listen.
I want you to know whatever happens...

93
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,001
Oh, my God.

94
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,161
- David...
- Shut up.

95
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,366
You shut up.

96
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,520
"On behalf of the admissions
committee, we're delighted

97
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,011
"to inform you...

98
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,127
"...that you have been admitted

99
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,447
"to the MIT class of 2018."

100
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,004
- Congratulations!
- Yay!

101
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,849
Yo, Adam,
she didn't get into anything.

102
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,684
We're celebrating, right?

103
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,603
You know, your father
would be so proud of you.

104
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,131
Dude!

105
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,331
David?

106
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,404
What's the matter?

107
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,360
"We've reviewed your request

108
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,171
"and we're pleased to award you
$5,000 in financial aid."

109
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,327
What?

110
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,801
Wait! What about
the other $40,000?

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,561
Mom, how are you gonna afford that?

112
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,246
- Look, dude, let me see that.
- Please, turn that off.

113
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,251
God, dude, look at those.

114
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,051
Perfect little tree trunks.
Those legs are like...

115
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,326
Good job, David.

116
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,568
- Sorry to hear about MIT.
- Yes, sir.

117
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,927
I also didn't
get a scholarship to MIT, Dr. Lou.

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,002
Also didn't sprout wings and fly.

119
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,288
Still a few scholarships left, David.

120
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,080
I'll look into those, sir.
Thank you.

121
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,244
Yo, just pretend it's not me.

122
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,005
If you could say one thing to MIT,
what would it be?

123
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,929
Um, this is stupid.

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,729
Wrong answer, dude.
You know what?

125
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,251
- Maybe you don't want to go.
- I do wanna go.

126
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,880
Dude, I think these nuggets
were frozen before Obama was elected.

127
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,566
David, prove it.
Prove that you wanna go.

128
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,887
How am I gonna prove
that I wanna go to MIT?

129
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,440
How about for a free ride,
every day, your mom shows up

130
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,688
and publicly hands you
your fungal medication?

131
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,049
Only if your mom does the application.
You know what I mean?

132
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,565
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah.

133
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,130
What if MIT was like,

134
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,567
"Go up to Sarah Nathan
and just start making out with her."

135
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,449
Why would MIT want me
to make out with people?

136
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,443
Because MIT
believes in bold risk takers.

137
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,091
I take risks. I'm a risk taker.

138
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,362
Yeah. Name one risk you took.

139
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,211
- Right now.
- Exactly.

140
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,004
That's not... That's too big.

141
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,446
This is what I'm saying, dude,

142
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,124
if I had your brain and bone structure,

143
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,929
I would be unstoppable.

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,082
I mean, aren't you sick
of having sex with your hand?

145
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,764
- What?
- I'm sorry.

146
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,649
He sniffs Sharpies.
You drug addict.

147
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,444
You totally are stupid, dude.

148
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,727
Hey, look. Hey, hey, dude, check this out.

149
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,081
Barn.

150
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,844
- Oh, hey, that's cool.
- Right?

151
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,161
Well, you see, that's my problem.

152
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,810
I can't get the Uls to interact.

153
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,201
Oh, you got to put
the L2 cache in ad hoc mode.

154
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,800
Obviously...

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,081
What are you doing?

156
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,241
Oh, my God, Jessie Pierce.

157
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,362
Dude, I would literally give away
all my earthly possessions

158
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,487
for one date with her.

159
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,800
What, are you gonna
give her your Xbox

160
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,291
and a coupon at Chipotle?

161
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,805
Will you please get in the car?

162
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,006
Bye, guys, see you later.

163
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,565
- Chris, come on!
- Coming!

164
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,921
Look at the bright side, David,

165
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,929
you're gonna have
so much free time now.

166
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,640
Hey, Jessie, what are you doing tonight?

167
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,444
- David wants to take you out!
- You're such an idiot.

168
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,602
- Dude, I'm hooking you up.
- Shut up, Quinn.

169
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,206
Yo, keep it up, ladies!
You know, you wouldn't...

170
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,489
David, what the shit, man?

171
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,483
- Why do you drive this car?
- So embarrassing.

172
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,721
This is the best part of my day.

173
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,560
One day, this car
is going to kill us.

174
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,445
Don't let them see me.

175
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,607
Yo, relax!

176
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,960
It's a classic!

177
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,849
C'mon.
Just move that piece of shit!

178
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,968
I think it's my starter relay.
Give me that Leatherman, please.

179
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,201
Well, actually, I believe it's

180
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,850
the fuselage valve, but what do I know?

181
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,604
You're confusing my car
with an airplane, but, uh...

182
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,926
David, you got this?

183
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,087
Yeah, no, I got it.

184
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,480
Please tell me you got it working.

185
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,005
Come on, come on, come on.

186
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,686
Dude,
if you want a permanent fix,

187
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,171
just let me know.
I'll take a look at your car.

188
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,730
Sure, you're gonna fix my car?

189
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,571
What the hell is that?
Oh, shit.

190
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,723
Oh, my God.

191
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,806
David?

192
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,925
This doesn't make any sense.

193
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,604
Mom, goddang.

194
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,410
The house will pay for MIT,

195
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,808
and Aunt Chloe says your sister and I
can move into her apartment.

196
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,844
I can't let you sell this house, Mom.

197
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,410
There's got to be
something that I can do.

198
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,561
I can get a job.

199
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,165
It's too late for that, David.

200
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,204
You tried to get a scholarship.
It didn't work.

201
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,811
Well, none of this
would have happened if...

202
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,763
David. Come on.

203
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,641
I'm sorry.

204
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,001
I miss your father, too.

205
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,441
But he would have wanted this.

206
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,851
You're just as smart as him, you know.

207
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,689
I'm not gonna let that go to waste.

208
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,041
Okay.

209
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,487
It is what it is, David.

210
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,525
There's nothing you can do about it now.

211
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,889
What are you, sulking?

212
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,200
God!
You scared the shit out of me.

213
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,006
I'm not sulking.

214
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,884
Dude, you should be happy.

215
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,121
You're getting what you wanted.

216
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,089
I'm the one who's getting screwed.

217
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,685
This isn't what I wanted, Chris.

218
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,881
I remember this thing.

219
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,962
I'm trying to solve this, okay?

220
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,130
How are you solving this
in the creepy attic?

221
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,248
Uh... It's dumb.

222
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,448
You know, there's this one
last scholarship where I have

223
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,081
to submit a proposal for
an experiment and I thought

224
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,321
maybe if I got it,

225
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,890
Mom wouldn't have to sell the house.

226
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,128
Huh.
Dad must have a million ideas

227
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,565
lying around up here.

228
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,721
I don't know, Chris.

229
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,080
I mean, I thought there'd
be something up here.

230
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,322
I can't find anything I can use.

231
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,002
Hey, what is this?

232
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,681
When did we get a video camera?

233
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,011
Oh, that's Dad's old camera, yeah.
Remember that?

234
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,691
Yeah.

235
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,842
Hey, look, it still works.

236
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,604
- Really?
- Wow. Yeah.

237
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,091
- Let me see.
- Check it out.

238
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,285
That's my seventh birthday.

239
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,771
I guess it makes sense
that's the last thing

240
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,922
- he would have filmed, right.
- Fuck.

241
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,520
Quinn, I'm telling you,
I'm looking at it right now.

242
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,170
You were a chubby kid.

243
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,480
Come here.

244
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,086
No, I mean, it's weird to hear his voice

245
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,248
for the first time, like,
after all these years.

246
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,886
<i>- Are you getting this?</i>
<i>- Light the last three.</i>

247
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,929
- What was that?
- Here we go.

248
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,883
Hold on a sec.

249
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,160
Nothing, I just saw something
weird in the mirror.

250
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,601
<i>- Are you getting this?</i>
<i>- Light the last three.</i>

251
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,562
Holy shit. Quinn, I got to go.

252
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,450
Chris! Chris, come down here!

253
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,404
I don't... I don't understand.

254
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,961
It just is.
I got to show Quinn and Adam.

255
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,005
There's this footage of me
at my seventh birthday.

256
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,082
I mean, I was at my seventh birthday.

257
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,446
We were all at your seventh birthday.

258
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,561
No shit.

259
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,642
No, I know, I know. Here.

260
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,809
Just... You don't understand.

261
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,161
Just watch this.

262
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,242
I still think it's
just a glitch in the camera.

263
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,163
- Oh!
- So right...

264
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,930
- Wow!
- Right as this lady walks by.

265
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,240
- Oh, my God, I remember this.
- No, no, no.

266
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,651
Right as this lady walks by,
look in the mirror...

267
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,330
Right there, right there!
Did you guys just see that?

268
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,727
Dude, I was so frickin' cute.

269
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,847
Dude, lwas cute.

270
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,002
Adam fell off that frigging bike

271
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,800
and it was the funniest thing
I'd ever seen.

272
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,524
Am I... Do I exist in the world?

273
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,120
Are you guys even seeing me right now?

274
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,685
Please, look at this.

275
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,125
Dude, you're crazy.

276
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,964
Ready, go.
Play. I'm ready, I'm ready.

277
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,763
Right there. In the mirror.
Look in the mirror.

278
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,442
- Holy shit.
- Holy shit.

279
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,964
Dude, is that... That can't be.

280
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,720
That's me.

281
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,643
David, you are just
seeing what you want to see.

282
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,846
Maybe, I don't know,

283
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,041
someone could have photoshopped it.

284
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,360
Nobody's messed with it.

285
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,528
It's been in my attic for 10 years.

286
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,088
Look, it's obviously
like a relative or something, David.

287
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,800
Family does tend to actually look alike.

288
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,047
All right. Well, then explain this.

289
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,363
We're wearing the same shirt.

290
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,485
What's with the camera, Chris?

291
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,403
Yeah, isn't it cool?
It's my dad's.

292
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,289
Oh, that bitch.

293
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,771
What is
Sarah Nathan's problem?

294
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,205
She knows I like Justin.

295
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,721
Chris, check this out.
Lollapalooza was so sick.

296
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,921
Lemme see?

297
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,443
I am so jealous.
God, why did I have to miss that?

298
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,130
Uh, what is your brother doing?

299
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,247
No offense, Christina,

300
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,210
but that's kind of creepy.
He's just watching a tape of kids.

301
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,448
- Ew!
- You don't know...

302
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,807
Let me guess,
you found aliens at your party, too.

303
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,880
Okay, we're gonna be using
some really big words...

304
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,365
David, that's not you.

305
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,647
Okay, no! This is definitely me.

306
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,370
- Maybe.
- Look!

307
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,922
That is my T-shirt, that is my backpack

308
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,849
and that is my watch. That's me.

309
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,850
Wait! What's the thing in your hand?
The ballerina thing.

310
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,368
- What?
- Oh, uh...

311
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,444
A keychain, I think?

312
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,284
Okay.
Everybody, take out your keys.

313
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,362
Maybe it's not you, man.

314
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,364
Shit. Whose stuff is this in my bag?

315
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,646
Wait, wait. This is Jessie Pierce's.

316
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,006
- What?
- Are you serious?

317
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,481
You have a hot chick bag.
You're like a hot chick!

318
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,005
This is what you need to do.
Go over there

319
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,411
and pretend like you just don't care.

320
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,369
Throw it at her and be like,
"Yo, here's your shit, Pierce."

321
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,726
I'm sorry.
Have you seen David with girls?

322
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,848
Oh, I'm still right here, Chris. Be nice.

323
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,967
Oh!

324
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,369
No! I will go give this back to her.

325
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,488
No, no, no. I'm gonna go
and take it back to her, okay.

326
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,686
That's right.

327
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,330
I'm not gonna let
my sister do my bidding.

328
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,131
Man. Man. Yo, let me
smell your breath, though.

329
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,401
What are you gonna say?

330
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,320
Are you trying to communicate
with me telepathically?

331
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,925
Excuse me, I...

332
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,970
I have... I think you have my bag.

333
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,320
I think we switched bags.

334
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,210
Possibly? Looks like.
By the way, my name is...

335
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,611
- David?
- Yeah.

336
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,842
We've gone to school
together for four years.

337
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,161
Yeah.

338
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,522
Did you go through my stuff?

339
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,361
No.

340
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,809
I might have reached in there a little bit

341
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,649
to kinda feel around blindly, but...

342
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,649
Is that why you're wearing my perfume?

343
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,167
Well... I didn't spray that.
That wasn't me.

344
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,283
So other people
went through my stuff, too.

345
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,680
I'm really sorry, okay.

346
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,364
I just came to switch bags with you.

347
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,761
I would never have...
I would never do that.

348
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,806
David?

349
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,168
- Yeah.
- Congrats on MIT.

350
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,690
Um... Thank you.

351
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,246
Dude, David, you've lived here your
whole life. Where are you gonna go?

352
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,766
Quinn, come on,
can you stop talking about it all the time?

353
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,205
Guys, stop arguing
for two seconds, okay.

354
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,009
We need to figure out what
I'm doing on this tape, right?

355
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,201
So... So, I'm over here?

356
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,401
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're back there.

357
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,811
- Back there to the right.
Uh-huh.

358
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,723
Yeah, that's good.
Then somebody crosses frame.

359
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,887
Quinn, go here.

360
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,530
Actually, move the camera
to the left a little.

361
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,360
- Okay.
- And you, back to the right.

362
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,050
That's perfect, that's perfect.

363
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,129
Wait, wait. Split that difference.

364
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,123
Uh, there.
That's perfect. Don't move.

365
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,567
Right here. So what am I doing?
We're just standing here?

366
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,880
You're doing mad backflips.

367
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,729
Let me check.

368
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,524
Um, it looks like your right hand

369
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,085
is reaching for something.
Like, maybe the wall?

370
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,241
Okay.

371
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,920
Wait, no, no, no.
Behind the wall.

372
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,240
Yeah.

373
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,481
There's a light switch.

374
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,090
What does that one turn on?

375
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,605
Uh...

376
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,001
The basement? Let's check.

377
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,091
Down here.

378
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,685
Quinn, turn the lights on.

379
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,848
- This all your dad's stuff?
- Yeah.

380
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,684
Whoa.

381
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,047
Let's do this.

382
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,326
Are you sure
you should touch that?

383
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,845
Help me out.

384
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,806
We weren't allowed in here.

385
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,291
We're going in today.

386
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,521
Help me out.

387
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,484
- Ooh, spooky.
- Quinn!

388
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,449
Jeez! Someone's afraid
of the dark.

389
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,045
What are you, 10 years old?

390
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,846
Did you hear that?

391
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,048
Yeah, what was that?

392
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,281
I don't hear it anymore.
Was that the light?

393
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,488
Quinn, keep clicking
the lights on and off.

394
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,130
I thought I heard a sound.

395
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,965
There, there!

396
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,405
Yeah, I hear it, too.

397
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,051
It's like a fricking
clicking noise or something.

398
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,401
Yeah, check over there.

399
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,561
I don't know
where it's coming from.

400
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,802
- Where's it coming from?
- Uh...

401
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,121
Wait, I see something.
Leave the lights on!

402
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,331
Holy shit!

403
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,482
- No way.
- Oh!

404
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,410
Goddang!

405
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,485
Wait! Turn the lights back off!

406
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,767
- Why?
- Try this.

407
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,401
It's connected to the light switch.

408
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,969
Oh, my God.

409
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,681
That's the same thing
your dad was holding on the tape.

410
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,091
The case...

411
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,681
Help me out.

412
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,603
- Come on.
- Right here, right here.

413
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,924
What the hell?

414
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,445
Turn them on!

415
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,127
What the hell is that?

416
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,729
- Open it.
- No, you open it.

417
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,485
You need to open it.
It's your dad's.

418
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,531
Whoa!

419
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,405
Oh, my God.

420
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,925
Chris, come get this.
Chris, Chris, come here.

421
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,445
I'm getting it.

422
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,051
What?

423
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,124
Whoa.

424
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,365
You getting this, Chris?

425
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,482
What's D-A-R-P-A?

426
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,891
It's DARPA.

427
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,923
It's a classified division of the military.

428
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,411
They work on all kinds of crazy shit.

429
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,608
They invented the Internet,
tried teleportation.

430
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,250
I thought your dad
was in energy research.

431
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,244
Yes, my dad worked for
Eastern Power and Electric.

432
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,209
- I mean...
ls this it?

433
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,642
Uh... Thermomagnetic
accelerator navigation drive?

434
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,449
I don't understand.
This is some sort of a machine, guys.

435
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,931
What, like
a computer or something?

436
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,126
No, not a machine.

437
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,841
These schematics use equations
like the theory of relativity.

438
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,124
Engine pressure ratio.

439
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,248
Course deviation indicator?

440
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,641
Longitudinal static stability?

441
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,324
Hydraulic interface module.

442
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,767
Oh, wait, here we go.
Project Almanac.

443
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,447
ID number 453-Delta-71?

444
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,845
"Temporal relocation prototype"?

445
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,684
Temporal relocation?

446
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,086
That's... That's impossible.

447
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,685
Any time you guys
want to speak English

448
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,410
- so that I can follow.
- Temporal relocation.

449
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,090
What does that mean?

450
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,009
It means time travel.

451
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,084
I mean, that's what that means.

452
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,201
What?

453
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,001
Holy shit!

454
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,606
So you're telling me Dad left
a time machine in the basement?

455
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,364
Well... I mean, I guess technically,

456
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,602
he left blueprints, but, uh...

457
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,921
- Still...
- Slow down for one second, okay.

458
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,371
Let's just all take a beat here.

459
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,805
DARPA designed this.

460
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,441
So it could actually be real, right?

461
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,724
It's possible.

462
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,530
We should try to build it.

463
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,001
You guys, my dad messed around
with a bunch ofjunk down here.

464
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,127
Why would he hide junk then?

465
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,406
It's in a fricking case in the ground?

466
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,845
Even if it wasn't junk...

467
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,604
Dude, he must have left this for you.

468
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,200
Okay, I know you'd like to think that

469
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,323
my dad left me a time machine,
okay, but...

470
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,845
I think this glass thing is,

471
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,365
like, the heart of the machine.

472
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,249
It runs everything.

473
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,320
David.

474
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,290
Just for a second think about it.

475
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,084
You guys are...

476
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,608
You guys are crazy.
We can't build

477
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,922
a time machine in my basement.

478
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,606
I mean, did you see the tape
at your seventh birthday?

479
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,001
I mean, I think we already did build it.

480
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,602
Shit.

481
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,681
<i>Hello.</i>

482
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,770
<i>Sweetie, I got to go.
I got to go. I'm sorry.</i>

483
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,250
<i>Who were you talking to, Dad?</i>

484
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,685
<i>He's just a friend, David.</i>

485
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,525
<i>He's here to fix something.
I won't be gone long.</i>

486
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,965
<i>Promise?</i>

487
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,804
<i>Of course, I promise.</i>

488
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,321
<i>Here.</i>

489
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,804
<i>- Time me.
- Ooh.</i>

490
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,926
It is February 18th, 2014.

491
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,968
My brother has officially lost his mind.

492
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,362
He genuinely believes
he is building a time machine.

493
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,524
Extension cords,
fuses, relays, power cables.

494
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,645
It's cool you hang out with us.

495
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,085
You guys
are my ride home, Adam.

496
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,320
What happened to your pants?

497
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,203
Sarah Nathan
is a backstabbing bitch.

498
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,368
Okay, so I've got
five 1,000-volt DC couplers,

499
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,481
four 70-ohm resistors,

500
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,961
but I just can't find any, uh, capacitors.

501
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,088
- Did you check by the couplers?
- What do I look like, an idiot?

502
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,083
Well, you are
trying to build a time machine, David.

503
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,446
We're just trying to turn on
this glass box, okay.

504
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,600
Yeah, yeah, totally.

505
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,085
Hey, um, excuse me, sir,

506
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,049
but where is your time machine section?

507
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,801
Sorry. Nobody likes her.

508
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,086
We can all agree on something, right?

509
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,440
I mean, you have to kill Hitler.

510
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,720
That's like Time Travel 101.

511
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,968
Naturally, but none
of us even speak German, so...

512
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,407
That's why God
invented Google Translator, David.

513
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,520
- Exactly.
- They didn't have Wi-Fi in 1939.

514
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,244
These are all
the batteries we could afford.

515
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,771
Well, the guys who
built the Hubble Telescope

516
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,251
started out building it in their garage

517
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,725
with parts from Home Depot.

518
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,366
- Oh, what time was their curfew?
- What are you doing here?

519
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,807
Just getting a record
of you burning down the house.

520
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,927
What are you doing?

521
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,765
I used to kind of watch Dad
do a lot of this stuff.

522
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,126
This is called stripping wire.

523
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,726
Hey, Quinn, isn't your mom a stripper?

524
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,440
Shut up, dude.

525
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,046
Hey, put the camera down?
I want to teach you.

526
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,125
All right, I think we're all set.

527
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,486
Christina, you
may wanna stand back.

528
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,642
We're pumping about
400 volts into this puppy.

529
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,444
So, uh, what,
you plug those things together

530
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,931
and we're gonna go
back to the Stone Age?

531
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,724
No. If we can't turn
the glass circuit on,

532
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,928
there's no point in building
the rest of the machine.

533
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,886
I... I only have one. Sorry, guys.

534
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,250
Let's hit it.

535
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,447
What's happening?

536
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,607
It's supposed to...

537
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,245
I'm not seeing anything.

538
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,166
- Holy shit.
- Oh, crap.

539
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,361
Are you okay?

540
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,010
- What does that even...
- Give me the camera.

541
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,321
Give me the camera.
Look at yourself. Your hair.

542
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,209
- What is it? What?
- Your hair.

543
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,725
- On your head.
- Touch your head!

544
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,325
Oh, my God.

545
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,606
Wow.

546
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,808
Guys, guys, guys!

547
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,603
What the shit?

548
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,766
What's going on?
What's it doing?

549
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,842
Is anybody else seeing this?

550
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,686
It's creating electromagnetic energy!

551
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,290
Whoa!

552
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,010
- Whoa!
- Oh, shit!

553
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,446
What the...

554
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,727
It's in my mouth! Dude! Dude!

555
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,210
All the batteries are fried.

556
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,930
This battery flew up and almost hit me.

557
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,287
- Dude, it did hit me.
- Film everything.

558
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,122
From now on, film everything.

559
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,608
I've literally never seen
any inputs like this before.

560
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,045
I mean, it must be a prototype.

561
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,690
Let me see it.

562
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,484
It's DARPA. They have access
to more technology than we do.

563
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,209
Intentional obsolescence.
You've got to love it.

564
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,404
Oh, wow. This is...

565
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,241
We need a graphics processor.

566
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,522
Where the hell do we get one of those?

567
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,843
You owe me a new Xbox, dude.

568
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,002
Okay, you know what, guys?
Just don't talk to me for a while.

569
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,162
When you love something,
Quinn, you have to set it free.

570
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,480
This isn't a joke to me, Christina, okay?

571
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,005
This is my life here.

572
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,241
Right there, right there.

573
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,448
Wow. What the hell is that?

574
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,160
Uh, some kind of navigation program.

575
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,641
I think we can control
the time machine with this.

576
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,927
Okay, so, you're telling me
that thing can run the whole machine?

577
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,880
I thought it called for
a boatload of computers.

578
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,287
No, this was 12 years ago
my dad made the schematics.

579
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,124
They didn't have the technology.

580
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,850
Trust me, welcome to 2014.

581
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,691
This thing is strong enough
to send a rocket to the moon.

582
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,280
You enter the time here,

583
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,124
and you just press
the red button and boom.

584
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,725
- We're Doctor Who.
- Who's Doctor Who?

585
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,884
Dude, I am sorry for every
mean thing I've ever said to you.

586
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,007
- Really?
- Yeah.

587
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,969
- Mean thing today. What he said today.
- Oh, yeah, today.

588
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,561
So, how much longer
is this gonna take?

589
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,642
Chris, it's not some
high school textbook, okay.

590
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,563
This is highly classified schematics.

591
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,291
It could take a day, take weeks.
We don't know.

592
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,760
It goes back six weeks, but

593
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,801
we have to split the power
for the return trip,

594
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,565
so it's three weeks in the past,
three weeks back.

595
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,965
If we go further than that,
we're basically stuck there.

596
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,241
What?

597
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,084
We're stuck in the past forever!

598
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,241
Why?

599
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,290
If we go more than three weeks...
I'll tell you later!

600
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,731
Goddang it!

601
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,291
Oh, shit, my Xbox
is all tricked out.

602
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,921
That looks good.

603
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,966
That's insane.

604
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,684
You finish with those couplers yet?

605
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,364
Yeah, almost.

606
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,761
Whoa, what the hell, man?

607
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,526
Wait. Are you...

608
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,170
These two wires right here?

609
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,242
What do I do with this screwdriver?

610
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,489
Here we go. There it is.

611
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,847
That's it!

612
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,888
Uh, I think I finally
got this thing dialed in.

613
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,088
- This looks good, David.
- You need this for something?

614
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,328
- I feel like you might need this.
- No, I don't need that.

615
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,930
Hey, guys, are we in position?

616
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,445
Wait, let me get my helmet.

617
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,646
Relax, the switch is cold.

618
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,842
- I thought you just said it was cold!
- It's off!

619
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,361
That is not cold!
Do you know what "cold" means?

620
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,284
- Do you feel the power?
- Guys, guys, guys!

621
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,281
What the...

622
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,086
How is this happening?

623
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,207
I don't know.

624
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,806
Is it all the electromagnetic energy?

625
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,642
Oh. Then explain this. Come here, Chris.

626
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,643
Holy shit.

627
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,286
- Oh, my God. Look at that!
- Oh, shit.

628
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,205
What the...

629
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,481
Guys!

630
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,681
Holy shit, are you guys seeing this?

631
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,085
Does it hurt? What's it like?

632
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,049
What's my hand doing?

633
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,084
David, the battery's overheating!

634
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,240
Are you okay?

635
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,209
Yeah. That was... That was awesome.

636
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,006
These batteries are dead. It didn't work.

637
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,321
Guys?

638
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,410
Does this seem familiar to you?

639
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,611
Oh, my God.

640
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,164
Okay, so I was wrong.
That's definitely you.

641
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,242
I mean, you guys, we're, uh,

642
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,691
close.

643
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,322
We still need hydrogen.
Without it, we're done.

644
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,289
- What do you mean done?
- Without hydrogen, no fusion.

645
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,362
Without fusion, there's no time travel.

646
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,205
Well, how much will it cost?

647
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,520
It's not a matter of cost.

648
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,443
I mean, you need
a permitjust to buy it, so...

649
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,681
Oh!

650
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,682
You guys, I got an idea.

651
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,885
Cut the camera.

652
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,643
I can't believe we're doing this.

653
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,768
Wait, wait.
There's a security guard.

654
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,487
Hey, Argo, you realize
we're not taking hostages, right?

655
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,210
- What, you didn't bring yours?
- What?

656
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,691
Can we get expelled for this?

657
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,125
- Obviously.
- Shit.

658
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,129
Let's go.

659
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,725
Go, go, go.

660
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,244
We're clear.

661
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,564
Yo, what's the code?

662
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,722
One, three, four, five.

663
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,290
- Come on, hurry.
- Wait, is it...

664
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,164
It's pi. Duh.

665
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,129
Put it, put it, put it.

666
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,645
- Yes! Lights.
- Go, go, go, go!

667
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,324
Someone get the lights.

668
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,243
- Lights, lights.
- Go, go, go!

669
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,004
Guys, it's probably
locked in one of these, okay?

670
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,286
Wait up. David, David.

671
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,767
David, too far,
too far, come back.

672
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,844
- Yes!
- Nice.

673
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,126
God, I'm strong.

674
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,924
- Hey, get one of those crates!
- Yeah.

675
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,286
Yo, how much do we need?

676
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,640
We'll take them all.
Get the bag.

677
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,881
We might not get another shot.

678
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,086
Here, I got two crates.

679
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,400
Yo, I can't carry all that.

680
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,209
Careful, it's hydrogen!

681
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,730
Got it. Let's get out of here.

682
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,882
- Whoa!
- Oh, come on.

683
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,644
- You frickin' idiot.
- Shut up!

684
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,006
Come on!

685
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,920
- You got the camera?
- Yeah, got it.

686
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,247
Come on, come on, come on.

687
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,285
You first.

688
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,325
Hey, does anyone want to take like...

689
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,890
I don't know, like a five-minute break?

690
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,530
It looks like Walker's having a party.

691
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,325
Guys, it works.
The hydrogen fits.

692
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,843
Chris, get in position.

693
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,889
What's with the watches?

694
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,405
Okay, so if this works,

695
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,369
when the red one comes back,
it'll be 60 seconds

696
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,010
behind the black one.

697
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,605
Here you go.

698
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,208
This is Project... Oh, yeah.

699
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,683
This is Project Almanac.
Experiment one, trial one.

700
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,524
Temporal distance, 60 seconds.

701
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,204
In English, please?

702
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,647
Uh, it means we're going
to send your crappy toy

703
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,762
a minute back into the past.
All right, you guys ready?

704
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,689
Quinn. Are you going to set this?

705
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,888
- Oh, shit.
- One job, he has one job.

706
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,287
- GoPro, set.
- Come on, come on, come on.

707
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,650
All right, we're good.

708
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,840
Three, two...

709
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,251
Wait, let me put my goggles on.

710
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,924
Chris, come on,
be present, focus.

711
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,081
One second.

712
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,446
- You good?
- I'm good.

713
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,000
Three, two, one.

714
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,644
- What the hell?
- Just give it a second.

715
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,010
Do it again, just do it again, man. Go on.

716
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,051
Three, two, one.

717
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,086
What the hell, Adam?

718
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,286
Just give me a second.

719
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,328
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

720
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,521
Oh, shit.

721
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,329
- All right.
- It's working!

722
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,529
The power's holding!

723
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,768
What's going on?
Come on, come on!

724
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,086
Oh, shit!

725
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,406
Come on!

726
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,885
What the hell?

727
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,082
No, no, no, no.

728
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,804
- They're fried.
- Really?

729
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,530
You guys, we haven't
had a night off in weeks.

730
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,965
Why don't we just, you know,

731
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,525
take it off and check out the party.

732
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,443
Then how the hell
are we supposed to do this?

733
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,046
This thing just keeps
eating through batteries, man.

734
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,607
We need a really strong power source.

735
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,241
Something that can
recharge itself as it puts out power.

736
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,004
It's nickel-metal hydride.
Oh, my God, how did I not...

737
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,367
Oh, for sure. What did he say?

738
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,247
What the hell is he doing?

739
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,369
Beats me.

740
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,645
Why is he getting Jessie Pierce
to park in our driveway?

741
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,449
Right there's good.

742
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,765
Whoa! Jessie Pierce drives?

743
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,524
I assumed she just, like,
appeared out of thin air,

744
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,170
like most mythological creatures.

745
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,890
You guys coming to the party?

746
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,804
- Yeah. We just gotta get changed.
Uh-huh.

747
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,725
- Stay out of my perfume.
- Jessie, come on.

748
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,408
I'm gonna need
every jumper cable you can find.

749
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,720
We're going to use her battery.

750
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,610
I got them.

751
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,768
- Christina.
- Here you go.

752
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,689
What's so special
about this hybrid battery?

753
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,888
Its negative electrode uses
a hydrogen-absorbing alloy...

754
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,281
Okay, you know what?
Forget I asked.

755
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,961
- Connecting now!
- Wait!

756
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,405
- Dude!
- That was awesome.

757
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,130
Hey, what's the hell's
taking you guys so long?

758
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,168
Well, maybe, you know,
if Adam wasn't trying to kill me,

759
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,560
then it might go a little faster.

760
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,602
Stop laughing, it's not funny! Come on!

761
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,081
- We're good.
- Let's go, let's go! Come on!

762
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,685
Quick! Adam, clean off the table.

763
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,921
How long do we have?

764
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,526
I don't know.
Chris, how long do girls stay at parties?

765
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,329
Well, dude,
hot girls don't stay at parties long.

766
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,050
They go to multiple ones,
like five or six a night.

767
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,849
- What do you know about that?
- Is this gonna work?

768
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,048
I don't know, there's a good chance
we're gonna blow up her car.

769
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,248
- Chris, give me a hand. Here.
- What?

770
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,084
Look, I want you to make sure
this connection is stable.

771
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,924
- So we just go, right, David?
- Yeah! It's cool.

772
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,606
GoPro set.
Wait, let me get my helmet.

773
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,920
- Coordinates set, 60 seconds.
- Come on, come on.

774
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,689
Let me get my goggles!

775
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,329
Oh, shit, it doesn't reach.
Guys, table, table, table!

776
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,531
Okay, one, two, three, push.

777
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,400
Again, again!

778
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,891
One, two, three, push.

779
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,361
Whoa!

780
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,407
Everybody, back, back, back.

781
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,804
Look at the camera!
Look at the camera!

782
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,362
Let me get my camera!
I gotta get it!

783
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,171
Let me get my camera!
Hold on one second!

784
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,481
Chris, come on!

785
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,971
Chris, hurry up!

786
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,121
Aw. Jeez, that was loud.

787
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,801
Oh, my God.

788
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,087
David, let me in!
David, open the door!

789
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,730
Oh, shit, guys! It's Jessie.

790
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,804
Do not let her in!
She can't handle this, honestly!

791
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,648
David, what the hell? Wh...

792
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,684
What is going on?
What are you doing?

793
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,524
Jessie, get down!

794
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,286
Why? What are you guys doing?
Oh, my God.

795
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,600
Project Almanac.

796
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,728
Experiment one, trial two.

797
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,247
Get that, get that, get that!

798
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,241
- What is all this?
- Get this! Get this!

799
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,971
Get down!

800
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,241
Oh, my God, the lights went out.

801
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,131
Are you guys okay?

802
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,850
Yeah. Are you?

803
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,283
- You okay?
- Yeah.

804
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,124
That scared me.

805
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,324
Good idea.

806
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,322
Oh, God. Oh, God.

807
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,449
What the hell?

808
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,322
Wait, disconnecting.

809
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,081
Grab the camera.

810
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,891
Where's the...
Guys, where's the Corvette?

811
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,207
It was supposed
to be here, one minute behind.

812
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,964
What the hell did you guys do?

813
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,088
I can't believe
the Corvettes not there.

814
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,401
This doesn't make any sense.

815
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,845
Ow, ow!

816
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,606
Chris, are you sure you're okay?

817
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,330
Yeah, I'm okay.

818
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,009
Oh, shit.
Hey, guys, I found it!

819
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,924
- No way.
- Oh, my God.

820
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,806
What?

821
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,646
It's fused to the fricking wall!

822
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,406
- No way.
- Are you guys seeing this?

823
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,369
Yo, stopwatch.

824
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,444
My God!
It went back two hours. David?

825
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,682
- Two hours?
- That's what it says.

826
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,371
What's on the GoPro?

827
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,124
<i>- Clean off the table.</i>
<i>- How long do we have?</i>

828
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,281
<i>I don't know.</i>

829
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,885
It was there the whole time.

830
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,804
<i>Well, dude,
hot girls don't stay at parties long.</i>

831
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,530
<i>They go to multiple ones,
like five or six a night.</i>

832
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,045
<i>What do you know about that?</i>

833
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,929
I can't even comprehend this right now.

834
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,206
It works.

835
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,521
We sent something back in time.

836
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,365
Chris...

837
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,330
- Hey.
- Hey. You okay?

838
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,849
Uh, yeah. I just...

839
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,881
I don't really understand
what just happened.

840
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,006
Well...

841
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,483
We just built a time machine.

842
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,130
- We built a time machine.
- We built a time machine.

843
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,050
Smoke! Shit! The cables!

844
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,725
- Get the fire extinguisher!
- Oh, my God. My car!

845
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,806
So, what's with the backpack?

846
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,166
I'm reducing the width of frame

847
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,608
so the machine can fit inside
a 22-by-14-inch backpack.

848
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,045
So we could
just walk around with it?

849
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,327
- It'd only weigh 8 pounds.
- The whole thing?

850
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,722
Goldberg!
It's time for your presentation.

851
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,969
Did that guy
just say "presentation"?

852
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,884
- All right, everybody, settle down.
- Quinn, you didn't study?

853
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,485
No, I didn't study.
I've been building a time machine.

854
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,681
Let's get this over with.

855
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,524
- You're up first.
- Yeah, I know.

856
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,883
Name the first 10 elements
of the periodic table.

857
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,487
All right, so, um,
I was thinking we should

858
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,050
start off small. I was making a list.

859
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,647
- Uh, bacteria, to send through.
- Yeah.

860
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,449
I can grab something
from Dr. Lou's class.

861
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,686
He actually really likes me.

862
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,762
Yesterday I was at Petco with my mom.

863
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,731
And they have, like,
dozens of those little white mice,

864
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,689
and you could just send those back.

865
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,047
Think about it.
If you were a mouse, you'd be like,

866
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,485
"Damn, I'm time traveling right now!"

867
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,962
Guys, I'm serious.
We need to keep this quiet.

868
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,205
Okay, Jessie saw me staring at her.

869
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,851
That's real smooth...
Real smooth, David, perfect.

870
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,571
Guys, can you please not just
all look at her? Guys, stop!

871
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,886
Hey, guys!

872
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,724
- Smooth, guys. Nice.
- Is she coming over?

873
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,040
David, game face,
put your game face on.

874
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,043
I haven't got a game face.

875
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,843
Somebody say something.

876
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,362
Okay,
thank you for letting us use your battery.

877
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,522
Yeah, no problem.
What are you going to do with it?

878
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,841
Well, we're gonna test it.
We're gonna...

879
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,121
But I thought
you already tested it.

880
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,044
Yeah, yeah, but we haven't tested
on a living organism.

881
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,929
So now you're going to
test it on people, right?

882
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,047
No!

883
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,724
- Bacteria first.
- Or puppies.

884
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,320
- We need to start...
- Puppies?

885
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,407
You've been to Petco, right?

886
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,606
You've seen all the white mice?

887
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,761
Quinn, enough with the Petco.

888
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,330
We have to take this step by step.

889
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,731
Be very conscious of what we're doing.

890
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,371
Right, but shouldn't
the next step be, like,

891
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,084
testing it on us?

892
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,209
It's not... You know, this is not a toy.

893
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,770
We need to take it step by step...

894
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,410
I'm not
saying it's a toy, but like...

895
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,244
I mean, there's a lot
of things we have to think about...

896
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,765
Hey, what is that?

897
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,649
- What is this?
- What? My keys?

898
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,450
Oh, my God.

899
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,761
What's wrong with my keys?

900
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,120
They're just really cool.

901
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,764
You're kidding, right?

902
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,329
- Hello?
- Sorry.

903
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,762
I don't...

904
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,287
- This isn't fake, right?
- No.

905
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,685
No, it's real.

906
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,082
It doesn't make any sense.

907
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,163
You guys film everything, huh?

908
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,522
I think, um, we have to go with

909
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,329
another inanimate object
and then move our way to...

910
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,640
No.

911
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,846
You know, plants and...

912
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,604
- Come on.
- Come on, what?

913
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,125
You're watching this video
and you're gonna send

914
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,531
another inanimate object through?

915
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,284
It'll be very
potentially dangerous.

916
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,681
But you know that you can do this.

917
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,409
What are you waiting for?

918
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,361
If we increase the power
to the glass circuit,

919
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,683
the diameter of the warp
could expand to 9 feet,

920
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,524
which may fit all five of us.

921
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,005
Graphics processor dialed in.

922
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,161
Am I gonna get electrocuted?

923
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,129
Setting the machine
to 24 hours back.

924
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,486
That's how far we'll push it.

925
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,722
David, I'm getting scared.

926
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,611
Running system diagnostic test.

927
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,010
All systems check.

928
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,971
Guys,
turning machine to standby mode.

929
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,640
We're ready to go.

930
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,447
Dad, I'm not sure what you were
doing down here

931
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,244
or why you were doing it,

932
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,129
but this is for you.

933
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,601
Full disclosure, guys.

934
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,926
There's a slight chance that

935
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,891
oxygen and nitrogen naturally
found in the air could catalyze.

936
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,682
What does that mean?

937
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,444
We could explode.

938
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,286
Here. Set the GoPro up over there,

939
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,886
so we can get a, you know,
wide shot of the environment.

940
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,047
Okay.

941
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,923
We need to move away from the car,
away from the trees,

942
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,445
and everything, right.
Get some clearance.

943
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,045
Remember, the warp has
a 10-foot diameter, so...

944
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,168
- Yeah.
- Where should we go?

945
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,361
I think, um, yeah, right here?

946
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,524
Are you recording?

947
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,602
No, the red light means
something else entirely.

948
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,645
Okay.

949
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,725
To reiterate,

950
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,167
because of the catalyzation
of the oxygen in our lungs,

951
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,242
do not hold your breath.
You got that?

952
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,211
Yeah.

953
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,604
Because of the high level of impact,

954
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,047
- keep your body loose, right?
- Yeah.

955
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,607
And because of UV light,
keep your eyes closed.

956
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,523
Yeah.

957
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,331
Okay, is anyone else, like,
shitting their pants right now?

958
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,004
Or is it...

959
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,924
Guys, I'm not gonna lie.
I'm completely terrified.

960
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,369
But I'm the one who's on the tape.

961
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,565
So if you guys
don't want to come, I understand. Okay?

962
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,571
I'm in. If you're going, I am.

963
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,930
I'm in, too.

964
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,090
I'm with the group.

965
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,442
I've done every boring thing
with you since first grade.

966
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,965
Of course I'm coming.

967
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,600
All right.

968
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,205
Let's step in.

969
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,169
Wait, like right now?

970
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,167
It's all right. It's okay.

971
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,523
We're going to be okay.

972
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,960
We're gonna be okay.

973
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,849
Chris, come on, you need to get closer.

974
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,126
Okay.

975
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,131
All right, you guys ready for this?

976
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,850
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

977
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,489
Get in closer!

978
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,003
Guys! Guys! Look!

979
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,162
Holy shit! Get down!

980
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,810
God, it's burning.

981
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,291
David, your ears.

982
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,727
Guys?
Guys, I can't hear anything.

983
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,928
Guys? I can't hear!

984
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,488
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

985
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,490
You can? Okay.

986
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,083
Holy shit!

987
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,885
You okay?

988
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,210
- Where's Adam?
- Yeah, where's Adam?

989
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,964
- Where's Adam?
- Adam!

990
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,648
What the hell?
What the hell?

991
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,684
- My God, please tell me you got that.
- Are you all right?

992
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,364
Please tell me you got all that.

993
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,846
You all right, buddy?

994
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,410
I'm okay.

995
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,641
We're okay.

996
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,563
Did it work?

997
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,208
Where's the car?

998
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,642
Well, if it worked, it's not gonna be here

999
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,882
until we drive it here tomorrow.

1000
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,242
Look at this. Look.

1001
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,601
Holy shit.

1002
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,291
David, we need
to see if this really worked.

1003
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,727
Wait, I got an idea. Yeah,
I got a sick idea. Come on.

1004
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,847
Shh.

1005
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,001
My neighbor's dog is a beast.

1006
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,844
- Why are we going in your house?
- Just trust me.

1007
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,160
Seriously, this is what we're doing?

1008
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,049
My mom's asleep, just don't wake her.

1009
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,240
I want to see if this works.

1010
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,361
Have you guys ever
seen the movie Looper?

1011
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,647
- No.
- God, I love that movie.

1012
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,923
What are we doing?

1013
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,965
What are we doing here?

1014
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,690
It's sick, right?

1015
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,485
- Watch this, watch this.
- No, no, no...

1016
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,846
Shh. Stop!

1017
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,401
You guys! Shh.

1018
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,603
Oh, my God.

1019
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,404
Get that. Get that.

1020
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,482
Oh, my God, this is cool.

1021
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,530
This is sick.

1022
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,120
Oh, my God, he's waking up!
Guys, guys, guys...

1023
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,931
What? What?

1024
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,121
- What?
- What?

1025
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,884
- What? What?
- What? What?

1026
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,689
What? What?

1027
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,321
Oh, my God, what's happening?

1028
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,684
We've got to get him out of here!

1029
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,488
- Quinn, stop looking!
- Go!

1030
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,485
It was a crazy feedback loop.

1031
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,289
- Look at me, are you okay?
- I'm all right. Okay.

1032
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,805
Quinn,
you disappeared for a second.

1033
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,120
I think we should get out of here.

1034
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,565
Yeah, we should
get out of here. Let's go!

1035
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,007
We did it! We really did it!

1036
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,127
It's yesterday!

1037
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,281
It's yesterday!

1038
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,448
It's yesterday!

1039
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,605
Whoo!

1040
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,131
Oh, shit!

1041
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,565
- Run!
- I'm trying!

1042
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,886
Run, run!

1043
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,121
Shit, it's coming!

1044
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,486
David, take us back!

1045
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,364
David, hit the button!

1046
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,805
David, get us back!

1047
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,566
Come on! Get close!
Get close to me now!

1048
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,369
Oh, my God, we're alive.

1049
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,925
Adam. Oh, shit.

1050
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,731
Are you all right?

1051
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,004
Are you kidding?

1052
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,210
Holy shit! Holy shit!

1053
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,526
Guys?

1054
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,882
I don't think we're alone.

1055
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,644
Hey.

1056
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,371
Hey ,puppy.

1057
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,087
Hey.

1058
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,247
He's drooling all over me.

1059
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,845
I know, he's drooling on me,
too, man.

1060
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,201
Move him over there.
He's on my side...

1061
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,447
Guys, why am I in the trunk?

1062
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,284
Quinn,
stop pushing him on my side.

1063
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,563
Sit, sit, sit.

1064
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,882
Guys... Guys, check it out.

1065
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,166
These flyers definitely
weren't here before we jumped.

1066
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,488
- Huh.
- There's so many of them.

1067
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,607
That's weird.

1068
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,007
Do you think
we changed things?

1069
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,731
What does it say?

1070
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,927
It says, uh, "Lost Dog."

1071
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,368
Guys, we changed reality.

1072
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,487
Holy shit.

1073
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,324
Oh.

1074
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,450
David, come on.

1075
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,607
Oh.

1076
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,242
Well, I told you we wouldn't die.

1077
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,247
Yeah.

1078
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,201
I, uh...

1079
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,280
No, I got my wallet.
Never mind. I thought it was...

1080
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,641
Thought it was on my side of the car?

1081
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,160
No, I was just checking my backpack.

1082
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,680
Thank you for the ride.

1083
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,480
- You're welcome, David.
- I'll see you, uh... See you at school.

1084
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,967
Dude, how have you
never seen Timecop?

1085
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,486
Quit saying that like it's a bad thing.

1086
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,891
Look, you're missing the point.

1087
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,804
You can't go back and give yourself
information about the future.

1088
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,691
Dude, wrong. That's the entire
purpose of time traveling.

1089
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,728
Here, just look at Terminators
one through four.

1090
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,450
My dad...

1091
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,210
He's a genius.

1092
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,130
He's an absolute genius.

1093
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,330
Dude, you could actually, like,
go back and meet him now.

1094
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,560
- We can do anything.
- We can meet anyone.

1095
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,641
Literally.

1096
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,326
You guys, we invented
freaking time travel!

1097
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,246
Why don't we sell this thing to Richard
Branson for, like, a zillion dollars?

1098
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,244
We didn't invent anything, first of all.

1099
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,609
We just put it together with the directions
that we had over there, so...

1100
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,400
You make it sound like we got it at IKEA.

1101
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,164
Okay, we can't sell it.

1102
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,090
No chance.
We don't even know what it is.

1103
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,241
We don't even know what it can do yet.

1104
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,811
Okay, well, look,
I mean, he's right,

1105
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,120
but we could beat the stock market,
or win the Powerball.

1106
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,481
Stock market, Powerball.
It's not about money.

1107
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,251
We could do whatever we want.

1108
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,481
Imagine the possibilities.

1109
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,005
It's like a second chance machine.

1110
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,287
We know.

1111
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,324
Okay, so we need to learn how to use it.

1112
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,560
How hard is it
to learn how to time travel?

1113
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,171
Obviously, very, man.
You almost short-circuited last night.

1114
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,170
Dude, you were disappearing.

1115
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,367
We gotta have rules.

1116
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,487
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1117
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,164
- Yes. So what are they?
- What are the rules then?

1118
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,760
First rule, no jumping alone.

1119
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,161
We always have to jump
all together every time.

1120
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,560
- That makes sense.
- Yes?

1121
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,767
What else?

1122
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,251
Well, we could film
all of ourjumps,

1123
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,640
so that if we mess something up,
we know what we did wrong.

1124
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,720
- That's a good idea.
- That's a great idea.

1125
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,042
And we have to keep it a secret. Right?

1126
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,361
So no Twitter, no Facebook,

1127
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,601
- none of that stuff.
- Absolutely.

1128
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,604
We should have code names.
Like safe words.

1129
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,202
You know, from now on,
I want to be called Obsidian One.

1130
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,005
I'm definitely
not taking part in any of that.

1131
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,127
Whatever.

1132
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,850
So what do you guys
wanna do with the machine?

1133
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,002
I want to see Biggie and Tupac live.

1134
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,521
You know what? I wanna go
to the original Star Wars premiere.

1135
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,767
That's not bad.

1136
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,524
Dude, that is so freaking awesome!

1137
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,728
Guys, guys, I wanna go back
and meet Einstein, okay,

1138
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,485
but this machine only goes
back three weeks. All right?

1139
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,404
So we have to take it slow.
Keep testing it.

1140
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,325
But there's still things we can change.

1141
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,641
Well, I just failed my Chem report.

1142
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,009
And I don't really wanna
repeat 12th grade,

1143
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,200
I'd probably go change that.

1144
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,005
I wouldn't mind being captain
of the baseball team.

1145
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,321
No.

1146
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,607
What do you mean, no?

1147
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,411
It's not a magic wand,
it's just kinda a time machine.

1148
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,011
Cool, thanks, man.

1149
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,686
Okay, right there, you guys.
You're broke.

1150
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,640
You're getting bullied.
I'm failing high school.

1151
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,604
You know, let's take
this thing out for a spin.

1152
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,846
Cheers to that.

1153
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,843
- Here's to taking it out for a spin.
- Hell yeah!

1154
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,729
Let's take it for a spin. Baseball...

1155
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,170
There, that's it. I think we got it.

1156
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,964
Okay, David,
so my Chem report was eight days ago.

1157
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,246
That's pretty secure.

1158
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,685
Here, let me fix your strap.

1159
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,207
Thanks.

1160
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,647
Looks good.

1161
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,807
Looks good.

1162
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,204
Experiment four, "Bait and Switch."

1163
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,124
Chris, are you already in class?

1164
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,526
I forgot my gym clothes.

1165
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,121
He's coming, he's coming.

1166
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,361
Okay, I see him.

1167
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,041
Chris, go stop him
before he gets to Chemistry.

1168
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,564
Hey, Quinn, hey, what's up?

1169
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,290
Um, Lou's sick, class is canceled.

1170
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,407
There's no sub?

1171
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,480
What are you, Sherlock Holmes?
No, there's no sub.

1172
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,043
- Sweet.
- You're good, don't worry about it.

1173
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,122
We're good, we're good.

1174
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,567
Okay.

1175
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,130
Awesome job, Chris.

1176
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,526
- Did it work?
- Yeah.

1177
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,647
What a douche.

1178
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,769
Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium, Beryllium,

1179
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,410
Boron, Carbon, Nitrogen.

1180
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,324
Then why are you texting him
at 3:00 in the morning?

1181
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,200
You're overreacting.
We're just friends.

1182
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,401
Quinny, listen.

1183
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,561
Relax, relax, relax.

1184
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,321
Quinn Goldberg.

1185
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,040
All right, everybody, settle down.

1186
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,924
Goldberg! Let's get this over with.

1187
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,844
Let's dance, Lou!

1188
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,721
Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium, Beryllium,

1189
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,484
Boron, Carbon, Nitrogen,
Oxygen, Fluorine.

1190
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,410
Atomic weight of Fluorine?

1191
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,806
Atomic weight, what?

1192
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,086
Do you know it or not?

1193
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,520
You didn't ask that last time!
So why would I know that?

1194
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,807
Last time?
What the hell are you talking about?

1195
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:56,010
Goldberg, this is about comprehension,
not memorization.

1196
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,927
See you after class.
Okay, let that be a lesson.

1197
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,120
Comprehension.

1198
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,403
Who doesn't know
the atomic weight of fluorine?

1199
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,766
Why did he ask him that?

1200
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,681
Okay, so fluorine is 15.2.

1201
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,644
Then why are you texting him
at 3:00 in the morning?

1202
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,767
You're overreacting.

1203
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,485
Okay, 24.03.

1204
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,005
All right, you ready?

1205
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,764
All right, settle down, everybody.

1206
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,530
Goldberg! Let's get this over with.

1207
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,801
My thoughts exactly.

1208
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,644
Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium, Beryllium,

1209
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,043
Boron, Carbon, Nitrogen,
Oxygen, Fluorine.

1210
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,245
- Fluorine.
- Yeah, Fluorine.

1211
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,560
Great, keep going.

1212
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:34,046
Neon, Sodium, uh, Magnesium,
Aluminum, Silicon.

1213
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,560
What's the classification of silicon?

1214
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,484
Silicon, are you kidding?

1215
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,131
Goldberg, this is about com...

1216
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,049
Comprehension,
not memorization, I know.

1217
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,481
You're kidding.
We have to do this again?

1218
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,404
This is hell. This is what hell is like.

1219
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,130
I made flashcards this time.

1220
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,521
I know everything
backwards and forwards.

1221
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,844
Then why are you texting him
at 3:00 in the morning?

1222
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,650
You're overreacting. He's just a friend.

1223
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,006
But she'll be screwing Ryan in a week.

1224
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,570
- Trust me.
- Hey, guys, look out!

1225
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,084
Shit, it's us.

1226
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,762
Did you just check out my ass?

1227
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,049
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I did. Um...

1228
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,607
Quinn, even Chris knows it by now.
This is ridiculous.

1229
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,680
Okay, okay. I'm gonna
Groundhog Day this bitch.

1230
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,763
All right, everybody, settle down.

1231
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,921
Goldberg! Let's...

1232
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,445
Get this over with!

1233
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,445
Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium,
Beryllium, Boron,

1234
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,364
Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen,
Fluorine, Neon, Sodium.

1235
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,800
What's the atomic weight of...

1236
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,001
Sodium, 22.98.

1237
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,406
What's silicon's classification?

1238
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,323
Silicon's classification is semi-metallic.

1239
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,285
And its electron configuration is

1240
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,125
Ne,

1241
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,011
3s2 3p2.

1242
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,286
And its atomic number is 14!

1243
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,967
Boom, Lou! Thatjust happened!

1244
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,442
That's mine. Quinn Goldberg, pleasure.

1245
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,281
What was that?

1246
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,521
Finally.

1247
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,602
- Finally.
- Thank God.

1248
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,962
- Perfect.
- What's next?

1249
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,721
Anybody?

1250
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,484
Well, I'm being
bullied in high school

1251
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,130
and I want to stand up for myself.

1252
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,327
Nice.

1253
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,481
Beat up Sarah Nathan. Got it.

1254
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,040
- Let's do it.
- Chick fight. I love it. Let's do it.

1255
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,487
Experiment 14, payback time.

1256
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,641
God, Christina. Walk much?

1257
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,651
Hi, Justin.

1258
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,643
You got this, Chris.

1259
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,925
You got this, Chris.

1260
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,322
I got this. I got this.

1261
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,481
- But you were just...
- I'm everywhere, bitch.

1262
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,606
Chris, you're a beast!

1263
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,446
You're a frickin' beast!

1264
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,162
Experiment 15,
saving our house.

1265
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,011
You think it's gonna work?

1266
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,401
I don't know.

1267
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,051
<i>Youkilis with the 1-0 count.</i>

1268
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,050
Line drive to right field.
Cano scores. Yanks up, 6-2.

1269
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,851
<i>...down the right field line. Cano scores.</i>

1270
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,565
Guys, what's taking so long?
You think there's

1271
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,210
- something wrong in there?
- I don't know.

1272
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,089
Do you think we can go to jail
for cheating on the lottery?

1273
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,969
You guys know
what we're doing isn't illegal, right?

1274
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,405
Hey, chill. I always wanted
to be a getaway driver.

1275
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,209
- Go, go, go, go!
- Jessie, start the engine!

1276
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,965
- Start the engine!
- I got it, guys! I got it!

1277
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,530
- Go! Go!
- I'm going!

1278
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,522
This is gonna be so frigging awesome!

1279
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,291
We'll never have to worry
about money ever again.

1280
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,684
We're gonna be so rich, I'm gonna hire
Kim Kardashian to have my baby.

1281
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,161
"Winner's Parking"!

1282
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,721
Oh, my God.

1283
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,847
Put it there. Put it right there.

1284
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,048
- This is worth so much money.
- I respect you for that.

1285
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:33,086
After taxes, that's $53,876,522.

1286
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,200
Want to bet me $100,000
that you're right?

1287
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,322
I'll bet you $200,000 I'm exact.

1288
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,927
All right, wait here. I'll go check.

1289
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,366
- She's checking?
- She's checking.

1290
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,487
She's checking.

1291
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,404
Congratulations. You're winners.

1292
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,127
Me personally,
I'm gonna take it easy at first.

1293
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,089
You know, I'm gonna get
a yacht, a few Ferraris,

1294
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,402
you know, then see what happens,
go from there.

1295
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:58,287
Okay, you guys do know
that $1.8 million after taxes

1296
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,249
isn't enough for what you want to do?

1297
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,209
You should save it, pay for college.

1298
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,522
I'm sorry, I thought you just said 1.8?

1299
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,161
It was 53 million,
876 thousand, and, uh...

1300
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,327
After taxes.

1301
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,000
You guys only got
five out of six numbers.

1302
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,560
- Why did you put 44?
- Are you kidding me?

1303
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,523
Because that's what you put down.

1304
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,841
That is not what I put down.
I put a... That is a nine.

1305
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,610
That's 49, Adam.

1306
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,966
- Are you blind?
- How is that a nine?

1307
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,326
You have to go back and do it again!

1308
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,121
I am not winning the lottery twice!

1309
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,122
Smile, guys, come on.
This is great.

1310
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,966
It's a million dollars, guys.
Are you freaking kidding me?

1311
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,847
Wait, what?
No, you have to use that for school.

1312
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,126
No, no.

1313
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,962
There was plenty more. Please.

1314
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,971
Oh, my God.

1315
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,004
Okay. Mom...

1316
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,166
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1317
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,287
I love you.

1318
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,250
- Make yourself useful.
- What the hell?

1319
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,651
- Whoo!
- Hey, welcome to Maserati.

1320
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,006
- Can I help you?
- Wassup, bro?

1321
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,684
What's a guy got to do to get
a test drive around here?

1322
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,962
Well, I'd love to, but this is
a big boy's car.

1323
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,402
You see, I was either going to buy
one of these or 17 Toyota Corollas.

1324
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,926
VVhoo!

1325
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,842
Oh, shoot, is that my xenon difluoride?

1326
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,201
Is that a sex doll?

1327
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,284
No, it's an insanely powerful battery.
Oh, my God.

1328
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,364
Bet right now.
Next person who scores, 10 grand.

1329
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,364
- Get in there!
- Damn it.

1330
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,602
- Pay up.
- This game is stupid.

1331
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,847
I wanna hear
my money being counted.

1332
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,086
One hundred, 200, 300, 400...

1333
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,406
David, come on.
Come hang out with us.

1334
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,606
Yeah. Look,
I'll be there in one second.

1335
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,080
I just wanna tweak something
with the auxiliary output, okay?

1336
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,202
David,
you're allowed to take a break.

1337
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,527
Hi.

1338
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,961
So, what do you think of David?

1339
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,884
Chris, it's your brother.

1340
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,043
Don't worry, he can't hear us.

1341
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,724
He is pretty smart, huh?

1342
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,042
Experiment 16.

1343
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,084
Attempting to extend the time differential

1344
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,323
between two and four years
with minimal voltage input.

1345
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,721
David? You're still down here?

1346
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,530
- Jess. Hey.
- Hey.

1347
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,803
Sorry, I think I left my English folder.

1348
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,882
Yes, you did. It's right there.

1349
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,406
Thank you.

1350
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,810
Is there something wrong
with the machine?

1351
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,844
No, I'm trying to figure out
how to make it go back even further.

1352
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,242
- You know what I mean?
- Can you?

1353
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,085
I think so.

1354
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:38,606
I've been running some tests on a new
battery source, uh, xenon difluoride.

1355
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,490
You just made that up, right?

1356
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,921
No.

1357
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,762
How far back could we go
if you got it to work?

1358
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,445
Ten years?

1359
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,809
Ten years. Seriously?

1360
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,723
Yeah. Ten years.

1361
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,729
Sorry. When you said "time machine,"

1362
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,690
I thought dinosaurs,
or at least Woodstock.

1363
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,123
Why do you always do that?

1364
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,930
- The watch thing.
- Oh!

1365
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,408
I don't know. It's like
a nervous habit or something.

1366
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,891
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1367
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,282
Are you saying I make you nervous?

1368
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,281
No.

1369
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,287
I, uh...

1370
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,805
So where did you get it?

1371
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,161
- What?
- The watch.

1372
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,971
Oh. Uh, my dad
gave it to me before he died.

1373
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,520
I was like... On my seventh birthday.

1374
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,369
- Your seventh birthday, right?
- Yeah.

1375
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,766
You lookjust like him.

1376
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,961
Really?

1377
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,891
- Handsome.
- Thank you.

1378
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,643
So how did he, um...

1379
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,530
It was a car crash.

1380
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,326
He left my party. Um, had some kind
of urgent call or something.

1381
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,567
I don't even really know.

1382
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,165
To be honest with you,
I don't know the whole story.

1383
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,890
You think you'll go back to save him?

1384
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,809
That's what I'm trying to do.

1385
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,880
If I can just get the machine
to go back that far.

1386
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,890
Maybe I'm the mastermind.

1387
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,280
Did you ever think about that?

1388
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,243
I mean, you're pretty smart.
You're pretty smart.

1389
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,685
I'm just saying, like, you know,

1390
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,000
clearly something's missing.

1391
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,481
And now you have my keys
and now you have me, so...

1392
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,683
Wait. What do you mean, I have you?

1393
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,843
Well, you know, I'm like...

1394
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,761
I'm part of the group now, right?

1395
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,564
What's outside?

1396
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,370
Oh, my God!

1397
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,967
I'd usually make a joke,
but this is awesome.

1398
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,770
Dude, Quinn is insane!

1399
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,769
David! What up, dude?

1400
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,690
He's crazy!

1401
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,487
I got Mexican food!
I got Cuban, fusion, Indian,

1402
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,891
all sorts of different flavors!

1403
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,011
Adam! Adam! Where's mine?

1404
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,725
Here, Chris.

1405
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,885
Way to go, Finn! Finn! Whoo!

1406
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,406
Did she just call you Finn?

1407
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,601
Finn?

1408
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,444
All right. Finn, Finn, Finn!

1409
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,965
Finn!

1410
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:02,923
Finn! Finn! Finn! Finn! Finn!
Finn! Finn! Finn! Finn!

1411
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,481
This is the best day of my life!

1412
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,527
Uh, sixth period,
under the bleachers, okay?

1413
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:16,887
Meet me there.

1414
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,845
Yeah, maybe if I'm done
having sex with all these girls.

1415
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,246
And in his effort
to avert the British

1416
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,924
from recognizing the Confederacy,

1417
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,608
he subjugated what?

1418
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,767
He...

1419
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:40,047
He subjugated the what?

1420
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,167
The...

1421
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,362
- Yeah, David?
- Can I use the bathroom?

1422
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,520
Yeah.

1423
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,487
So...

1424
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,922
He subjugated the what?

1425
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,966
He subjugated the what of the...

1426
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,087
Hmm?

1427
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,321
He subjugated...

1428
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,406
He just texted me, I swear. Hey.

1429
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,766
Yo, what's wrong with your face?

1430
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,763
- What?
- You're smiling, like huge.

1431
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,921
What are we doing here, David?

1432
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,367
- Yeah. What are we doing here?
- It's a surprise.

1433
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,488
- I like surprises. Shut up!
- No one cares what you like.

1434
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,761
I should be in trig, David.

1435
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,440
I know, I know. Don't worry,
we'll just be gone one minute.

1436
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,441
All right, guys-

1437
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,842
Who wants to push this thing
back three months?

1438
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,129
How? The machine can't do that.

1439
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,921
Trust me. Just brace harder than before.

1440
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,284
This feels different.
Are you sure this is okay?

1441
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,122
Guys, yo, yo, yo!

1442
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,484
I know it's not Woodstock
or anything, but...

1443
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,721
It'll do!

1444
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,086
- It'll do.
- Yes!

1445
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,207
All right, sweet.

1446
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,161
Can I have your number?

1447
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,047
Whoo!

1448
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,082
Dude, I'm supposed
to be in gym right now!

1449
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,000
I'm never going home!

1450
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,010
Oh, here. The schedule.

1451
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:45,006
We're not gonna see gangsta rap
over Vampire Weekend. That's dumb.

1452
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,320
You guys, wait, you guys. Guys.

1453
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,249
We don't have to argue.
This already happened.

1454
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,407
It's all on lnstagram.

1455
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,205
I know what was sick
and what wasn't. Dude, look.

1456
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,365
All right, let's go do it.

1457
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,968
Adam! Adam, hey,
will you hold the camera?

1458
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,406
Oh, my God.

1459
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,724
I love time travel.

1460
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,281
- Right here.
- What?

1461
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:07,965
- How did you get these?
- Dude, are those VIP?

1462
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,009
Yeah, three months
after the show,

1463
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,923
- five bucks on eBay.
- Oh, my God!

1464
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,291
Dude, David!
What can we do with these?

1465
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,891
Anything.

1466
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,961
Oh, my God.

1467
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,570
David, you're the man!

1468
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,326
We're backstage right now.
We are backstage right now.

1469
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,970
I can't believe you did this.

1470
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,088
I got a surprise coming.
I got a surprise for her.

1471
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,251
Listen, listen.

1472
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,480
<i>This song goes
out to Jessie Pierce.</i>

1473
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,402
Dude, that was sick!

1474
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,762
Okay, okay. You guys, I've got an idea.

1475
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:09,283
Just do what I do, okay? Follow me!

1476
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,445
Hey, how are you?

1477
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,290
- No way.
- Bend your knees.

1478
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,726
Just bounce.

1479
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,126
Like this or something?

1480
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,130
Loosen up a little bit.

1481
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,160
Just, like do this,
and you'll look like a cool guy.

1482
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,449
He's dancing!

1483
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,170
ls that good?

1484
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,367
Yeah!

1485
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,041
Whoo!

1486
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:56,961
Whoo!

1487
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,207
Whoo!

1488
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,926
- That's my boy! That's my boy!
- I'm number one!

1489
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:12,250
That was so much fun.
This is the best day ever.

1490
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:15,005
I can't believe it.
Thank you so much for taking us.

1491
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,446
She's really cool, David.

1492
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:25,971
- Who?
- Jessie, the girl you've been

1493
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:28,168
- freaking spying on for five minutes.
- What?

1494
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,285
Where'd you go?

1495
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,366
Whoo!

1496
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,201
Ahh!

1497
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,011
Oh! Hey.
JESSIE; Hi.

1498
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,444
- This is awesome.
- Yeah.

1499
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,205
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1500
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,441
Best friends, man.

1501
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,885
My best friends.

1502
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,800
Oh, my God,
he's actually gonna go for it.

1503
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,883
- Hey. How's it going?
- Hey!

1504
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,206
This is harder than it looks, huh?
To write something.

1505
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,248
- What would you do?
- Um...

1506
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,961
"Before the world ends,
I want to dance the night away."

1507
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,526
That's pretty dumb actually.

1508
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,965
Hey, I wrote that one.

1509
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,884
I mean, it's okay.
It's not that dumb. I just...

1510
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,803
- David, I'm messing with you.
- Oh.

1511
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,764
Oh. This is a good one.

1512
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,803
"Before the world ends,
I have to run naked

1513
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,400
- "through the streets."
Hmm.

1514
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,483
Are you picturing me naked now?

1515
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,601
No.

1516
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,802
Really? Not even a little?

1517
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,483
Some. A whole lot.

1518
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,160
I don't know...
What's the right answer?

1519
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,325
You'll never know. Oh!

1520
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,161
- Sorry, dude!
- No problem.

1521
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,606
Check it out!
"Before the world ends,

1522
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,011
"I have to time travel."

1523
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,248
"Before the world ends,
I have to win the lottery."

1524
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,367
Two for two.

1525
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,682
"Before the world ends,
I have to tell those bitches off'?

1526
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:08,921
Oh, yeah, my sister probably wrote that.

1527
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,360
- I think she did.
- Don't mind her. She has a bad attitude.

1528
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:14,002
I think we've almost crossed
everything off this list, huh?

1529
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,128
I think we're just getting started.

1530
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,810
"Before the world ends,
I have to fall in love."

1531
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,210
Probably not the worst thing
you could wish for, right?

1532
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,406
No.

1533
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,171
Probably better than owning
your own monkey or something.

1534
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,645
Probably, yeah.

1535
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,686
"Before the world ends,
I wanna go skydiving."

1536
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,120
Yeah, that's a good one, too.

1537
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,527
Totally. I heard it's really fun.

1538
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,521
- I'm going to go grab a water.
- Oh, okay.

1539
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:54,484
Yeah, all right. You know what,
I'll be right here. I'll wait.

1540
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,491
Oh, my God.

1541
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,046
The world is ending.

1542
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,361
- How'd it go?
- What?

1543
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,567
With Jessie.

1544
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,802
What with Jessie?
We were just talking!

1545
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,366
Seriously, David?
She left the door wide open.

1546
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,568
No, no, she didn't.

1547
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,442
She never even...
What are you guys talking about?

1548
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,646
It's okay. It's all right, man.

1549
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:46,644
Let's have fun.
Let's just have fun. It's all right.

1550
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,763
I'm burning up. We gotta go. Okay?

1551
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,445
I mean, we gotta go.

1552
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,767
I'm gonna get some water.
We gotta go soon!

1553
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,283
What happened to your shirt?

1554
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,767
We were there for nine hours!

1555
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,242
But we were only gone for 41 seconds!

1556
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,165
Dr. Lou still thinks
I'm on my bathroom break!

1557
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,080
Oh, my God!

1558
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,647
Oh, my God! That was the best!

1559
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,086
Best day of my life!

1560
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,129
That was the most fun
I've ever had in my entire life!

1561
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,241
I love you.

1562
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,761
Yeah!

1563
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,121
Whoo!

1564
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:45,841
- David?
- What?

1565
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,601
You're not gonna believe it.

1566
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,760
What are you talking about?

1567
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,962
Just go, come on. You'll see.

1568
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:55,124
Hey, Mom, so how was work today?

1569
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,761
It's been a long day, sweetheart.

1570
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,047
What?

1571
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,521
When did she get a job?

1572
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,761
Literally, check this out...

1573
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,604
- 4,000 likes.
- Let me see.

1574
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:08,725
4,000. Yeah, I have 18,000
lnstagram followers.

1575
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,724
Texts from 20 different girls, half, like,
"Quinn, oh, my God, please call me."

1576
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,320
- Show me the texts.
- Dude, I swear to God, I'll show you.

1577
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:17,045
What up? So I talked to you-know-who.

1578
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,804
Got one for you, one for Adam,

1579
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,327
one for me and one for Andre.
You're down, right?

1580
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,722
Uh, yeah, totally down.

1581
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:27,044
Good. Wear your black skirt.
You look hot in that.

1582
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,400
You and Sarah Nathan
are hanging out? What's that about?

1583
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,484
Dude, literally no idea, but since
we got back, she's been acting batshit,

1584
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,164
like we're best friends or something.

1585
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,722
I don't know what happened.
It's insane.

1586
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,650
Have you guys seen Jess?

1587
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,923
Uh, yeah, but you know what?

1588
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,923
I think she just said
that she's really busy or something.

1589
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,361
I wouldn't read too much into it.

1590
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,760
I'm kicking your butt.

1591
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,763
Three, two, one.

1592
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,447
- You're kidding me.
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

1593
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,607
Whatever, I quit.

1594
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:56,841
I'm inherently good at video games.

1595
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,001
All right, who's next?

1596
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,444
Hey, you don't want to play?

1597
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,010
No, I'm kind of tired.

1598
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,441
- Really?
- Yeah.

1599
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,880
- Taking off?
- Yep.

1600
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,287
Okay, cool, cool. Look, uh...

1601
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,922
Hey, can I... Can I talk to you
for just one second?

1602
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,365
Yeah, sure.

1603
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,841
Um...

1604
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,804
Did we have some kind of,
like a moment?

1605
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:19,362
Wasn't that a moment
the other day at the wall, and...

1606
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,286
I don't know.
I mean, it was a really fun day.

1607
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,966
It was cool, right?
And when you said that one thing,

1608
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,246
and I kind of...

1609
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,291
I don't know, there were so many people
around, I wasn't really thinking.

1610
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,407
I didn't expect you...

1611
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,727
I didn't expect someone
like you to really say that to me.

1612
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,290
What do you mean,
someone like me?

1613
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,330
You're like, fun, and you go out
to parties and, like, hang out

1614
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,129
and all that kind of crazy stuff.

1615
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,247
That's it.

1616
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,607
I mean, you don't care
about that important shit.

1617
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,644
You just have fun.

1618
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,484
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that.

1619
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,164
No, no, I know what you meant.

1620
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:52,881
It's fine.

1621
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,969
Whatever moment you thought,

1622
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,526
you know, happened,
you should probably

1623
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,807
just forget about it, I think.

1624
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,647
Okay.

1625
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,087
Some things just aren't
meant to be, you know?

1626
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,800
You don't have to film everything, Chris.

1627
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,002
- You wanna play some foosball?
- No.

1628
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,846
<i>That was so much fun.
This is the best day ever.</i>

1629
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,081
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

1630
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,360
<i>"...I have to run naked
through the streets."</i>

1631
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,601
<i>Hmm.</i>

1632
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:22,920
<i>Are you picturing me naked now?</i>

1633
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,081
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

1634
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,522
<i>- Sony, dude!</i>
<i>- No problem.</i>

1635
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,929
<i>"Before the world ends,
I have to fall in love."</i>

1636
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,481
<i>"Before the world ends,
I wanna go skydiving."</i>

1637
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,441
<i>"Before the world ends,
I have to fall in love."</i>

1638
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,681
<i>...I have to fall in love. "</i>

1639
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,604
<i>"...love." "...love." "...love."</i>

1640
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:48,206
<i>"Before the world ends,
I wanna go skydiving."</i>

1641
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:49,527
. <i>Yeah, that's a good one, too.</i>

1642
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,807
<i>Totally. I heard it's really fun.</i>

1643
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,844
<i>I'm gonna go grab a water.</i>

1644
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,965
<i>You know what,
I'll be right here. I'll wait.</i>

1645
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,530
Dude, I love this band.

1646
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,882
Oh, look, there's David.

1647
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:07,200
Oh, my God,
he's actually gonna go for it.

1648
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,802
A little more difficult
than it looks, huh?

1649
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,246
Yeah.

1650
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,721
"Before the world ends,
I have to dance all night."

1651
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,847
- Hmm.
- Pretty dumb.

1652
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,405
Hey, I wrote that.

1653
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,641
No, you didn't.

1654
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,085
- No, I didn't.
- Oh.

1655
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,804
"Before the world ends,
I have to run naked through the streets."

1656
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,560
You're trying to get me
to think of you naked, aren't you?

1657
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,326
Oh.

1658
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,480
Nice catch.

1659
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,086
Check it out! "Before the world ends,
I have to time travel."

1660
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:37,482
"Before the world ends,
I have to win the lottery."

1661
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,681
Two for two.

1662
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,842
I think we've almost crossed
everything off this list, huh?

1663
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,763
I think we're just getting started.

1664
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,851
"Before the world ends..."

1665
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,764
"...I have to fall in love."

1666
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:51,161
- Is that what you were gonna...
- Yes.

1667
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,002
Probably not the worst thing to wish for...

1668
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,362
All right, David,
what did you change?

1669
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,204
What have you changed?

1670
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,041
Hi, Jessie.

1671
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,567
Hey, Jessie.

1672
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,091
What you up to?

1673
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,886
What's... What's poppin'?

1674
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,644
Just call her.

1675
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,971
Hello.

1676
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,080
What are you doing?
What are you filming?

1677
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,130
Is everything okay?

1678
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,050
"Are you poking me?
- Huh?

1679
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,721
By the way, I told my dad
I was sleeping at Jennie's.

1680
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,685
Are you taking your towel off?

1681
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:43,807
Should I not take my towel off?

1682
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,240
You should. You absolutely should.

1683
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,408
What's wrong with you?

1684
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:50,208
Oh, my God, did we have sex?

1685
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,009
- Yes.
- Was it good? Was I good?

1686
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,127
Yes.

1687
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,322
Wow. So I saw you naked and...

1688
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,325
- Are you kidding?
- Well, I guess I did, 'cause we had sex.

1689
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,606
- That's true.
- Can I see?

1690
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:02,120
- You wanna... Okay.
- I want to see.

1691
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,931
Hmm.

1692
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,365
Happy Friday.

1693
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,331
I have to sneak out soon.

1694
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,442
I only have Thursday's clothes.

1695
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,364
David, stop it.

1696
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,610
Whatcha doing?

1697
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,360
I'm waking up, thank you very much.

1698
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,202
- You look amazing.
- David, please.

1699
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:40,371
Stop it. David.

1700
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,530
Let me see this.

1701
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,240
Oh. Good morning, David.

1702
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:46,847
Stop.

1703
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,485
Camera shy, huh, David?

1704
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,370
You seem a little camera shy.

1705
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,042
You know what, let's get rid of this thing.

1706
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,564
<i>Flight 437
has apparently crashed...</i>

1707
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,724
Good morning, Raskin house.
Chris, you look gorgeous.

1708
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,086
Christina, please put that laundry away.

1709
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,241
I don't wanna tell you again.

1710
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,322
Can you see the stain on here?
'Cause I got two job interviews

1711
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,561
today and I really need to look good.

1712
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,005
- Interviews?
- Yeah.

1713
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,490
Sweetie, you okay?

1714
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,403
Yeah. Mom, you look beautiful.

1715
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,483
Oh, thanks. Bye.

1716
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,125
What's up with you?

1717
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,201
What's up with you?

1718
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:25,807
I can't believe how good I'm getting

1719
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,689
- at sneaking past your mom.
- Yeah.

1720
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,321
By the way, my dad, who never
loves anyone, loves you. Somehow.

1721
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,851
He thinks it's really, really adorable

1722
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,251
every time you talk about science

1723
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,840
and all the projects that you used to do.

1724
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,411
It's kind of amazing.

1725
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,090
Enough, please.

1726
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:42,287
Aw, Chris.

1727
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:44,283
Please have mercy on me.

1728
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:51,886
What's up, Patrick?

1729
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,202
Dude, the other night was dope!

1730
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,407
Come on.

1731
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,240
God, what is up with you, David?

1732
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,205
Are we still on for tonight?

1733
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,522
Yeah. Yes, what time?

1734
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,882
Why are you acting so weird?

1735
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,207
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1736
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,050
- David, are you okay?
- Yeah, um...

1737
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,120
I forgot my...
I forgot my notebook in class.

1738
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,050
Okay. I'll see you later.

1739
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,440
- Okay.
- Okay.

1740
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,724
- Okay.
- Bye.

1741
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,403
Hey, Dr. Lou. Where are you going?

1742
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,247
Don't be a wiseass, David.

1743
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,366
What?

1744
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,210
Hey, you okay. Sarah, what's up?

1745
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,089
Everyone just mind their own business.

1746
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:37,160
God, what the hell
is up with him?

1747
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,924
"Better luck next year"?

1748
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,320
But we won the division.

1749
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,961
Hey.

1750
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,525
<i>You got to get over here right now!</i>

1751
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:48,766
Quinn, hold on, slow down.

1752
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,251
Oh, my God.

1753
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:51,965
Are you seeing this?

1754
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,641
I just don't understand
how this is even possible.

1755
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,764
How do we not remember this?

1756
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,489
But we could fix this, right?
We could fix this.

1757
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,922
I mean, we have the means, right?

1758
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,126
This is what we should
be doing in the first place,

1759
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,611
not partying.

1760
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,165
Hey. Guys, what's the emergency?

1761
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,080
David, look at this.
There was a plane crash, David.

1762
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,766
Seventy-seven people onboard a flight
from London to Madrid.

1763
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,609
It happened five days ago.

1764
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,841
Jesus.

1765
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,529
So, why are you guys
watching a plane crash?

1766
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,804
Because I think it's our fault.

1767
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,963
Why would a plane crash be our fault?

1768
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,044
Sarah Nathan's dad was the pilot.

1769
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,246
So what?

1770
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,970
Look, whatever we did at Lollapalooza

1771
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,645
had some crazy ripple effects.

1772
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,567
Wait, wait. Are you saying
that Lollapalooza caused a plane crash?

1773
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,642
Because that sounds crazy, dude.

1774
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:43,491
Look, I'm not crazy, okay.
It's cause and effect.

1775
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,684
Somehow we caused the basketball
team to not make the playoffs.

1776
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,966
Our captain, Justin Kelly,
broke his leg on March 1st, right?

1777
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,440
We all know that never happened.

1778
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,608
Then the basketball team
didn't make the playoffs,

1779
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,648
and that affected the players,

1780
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,331
their parents,

1781
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:00,120
hundreds of people who were
supposed to be at the game.

1782
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,009
And it just kept spreading.

1783
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,482
Sarah Nathan's brother,
he was on the team, right?

1784
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,687
Yeah.

1785
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,084
Her dad was supposed to be
at the game.

1786
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,049
He wasn't supposed to be
flying that night.

1787
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,247
David, look...

1788
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,520
Dude, there's other shit, too.

1789
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,764
Robberies. Fires.
None of this happened before.

1790
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,089
At some point, we're not gonna
be able to track this, David.

1791
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,606
If we don't stop this now,
it could just keep going out of control.

1792
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:21,806
David, we have to fix this.

1793
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,440
Look,
Lollapalooza was a mistake.

1794
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,851
We have to go back and make it so that

1795
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,251
- we neverjumped there in the first place.
- Right.

1796
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,361
No, no, no. We cannot go back.

1797
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,771
- We cannot do that, okay?
- That's the only way.

1798
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,080
- We have to.
- It's gonna undo everything...

1799
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,247
That's the point!

1800
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,691
- We need to undo it!
- We gotta fix this.

1801
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,640
I'm not even buying it.
I don't even think...

1802
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:36,409
Dude, you were the one
who set the rules!

1803
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,841
You're the one who said that
we had to be all freaking careful!

1804
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,291
I did. We all followed them,

1805
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,567
and kept each other accountable
on every single one!

1806
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,484
I'm not gonna go and play God
with you guys...

1807
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,767
David, you know what?
That is what we're doing!

1808
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,770
I'm gonna get Jessie, we're gonna come
over tonight and we're gonna fix this!

1809
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:52,042
If you wanna vote on that
'cause that will make you feel better,

1810
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,804
then that's fine,
but that's what we're doing!

1811
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,370
David, we get it, okay?

1812
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,644
None of us will remember Lollapalooza.

1813
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,241
Yeah.

1814
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,403
<i>Hey, Justin, look out!</i>

1815
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,605
<i>I'm calling 911.</i>

1816
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,445
Screw this.

1817
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,605
Oh, shit.

1818
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,529
Guys, I'm here!
David, it's me!

1819
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,284
It's April 23rd, 2014.
This is to keep a record.

1820
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,443
I know exactly what to do to fix this.

1821
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,290
<i>Justin broke his leg at Walker's party.</i>

1822
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:57,284
<i>I'll fix that. Everything else
will fall into place.</i>

1823
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,803
Guys, I'm sorry.

1824
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,282
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

1825
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,806
Oh, shit!

1826
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,849
Shit. Oh.

1827
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,650
David, what are you doing here?

1828
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,290
What do you mean?
This is where we're supposed to meet.

1829
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,407
You're 15 minutes late.

1830
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,601
No, we said we'd meet
at your house first.

1831
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:24,250
We had to track the controller.

1832
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,640
Oh, yeah, why didn't you call me?

1833
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,727
We all called you, David.

1834
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:27,961
- Really?
- The guys are right behind me.

1835
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,844
- Really?
- What did you do to the machine?

1836
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,720
You know, I'm just making
some modifications.

1837
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,046
Modifications? Why?

1838
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,645
We did a full systems check yesterday.

1839
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,371
Can I talk to you for a second?

1840
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,164
- What's on that?
- Just, uh...

1841
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,367
Oh, God, man.

1842
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,641
Can you just be my friend for a second?
I have to ask you.

1843
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,085
Of course I'm your friend.

1844
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,531
You know, like, the plane crash in Spain

1845
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:48,644
and the basketball team
and the fires in Brazil.

1846
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,171
It's not your fault.

1847
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,440
We've been over this, okay.

1848
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:52,846
No, no, no, no.
You're not listening to me.

1849
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,120
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault. It's my fault.

1850
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,005
I went back alone.

1851
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:58,681
There...

1852
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,571
- Alone?
- Yeah.

1853
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,331
Why would you everjump alone, David?

1854
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,400
David...

1855
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,481
It's not important.

1856
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,686
But where did you jump to?

1857
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:10,807
It doesn't matter. It's done.

1858
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,041
Stop it! Stop it.

1859
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,286
We don't have to undo everything, okay.

1860
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,966
We just have to make sure Justin
doesn't break his leg at Walker's party.

1861
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:18,120
We can fix it, man!
You gotta trust me. I can fix it.

1862
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:19,691
You can fix it? By yourself?

1863
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:22,845
Yeah, you broke the pact once
and now you're gonna do it again?

1864
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,043
- You're coming clean.
- No. I can't.

1865
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:26,690
- Why not?
- Because...

1866
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,530
Why, David?

1867
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,090
Because I'll lose her, man.

1868
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,761
I'm sorry, David.

1869
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,370
But you have to come clean.

1870
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,445
Guys!

1871
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,771
Guys, let's go!

1872
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,562
Come on!

1873
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,280
No, no, no, no. David, don't go!

1874
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:58,971
I'm sorry, Adam!
I would never do

1875
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,405
- anything to hurt you guys!
- David!

1876
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,360
You won't even remember
this happened!

1877
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:08,967
Hot girls don't stay
at parties long.

1878
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,048
- They go to, like, multiple ones.
- Table, table, table!

1879
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:14,925
Again, again!

1880
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,810
- Hey!
- Oh, shit!

1881
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:20,562
David! What the hell
are you doing to my car?

1882
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,764
Three, two, one.

1883
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,765
The lights went out.

1884
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,924
Sorry, excuse me!
Coming through! Excuse me!

1885
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,800
Justin, look out!

1886
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,445
Oh, shit.

1887
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,931
You saved me, bro.

1888
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,771
David, you're awesome.
You're like a superhero.

1889
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,327
- Excuse me.
- That was so awesome.

1890
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:49,727
Right here, man.

1891
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,280
- That was badass.
- Excuse me.

1892
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,970
<i>You have two new messages.</i>

1893
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:10,288
<i>Hey, babe, sorry I missed you.</i>

1894
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,290
<i>I'll see you later tonight. Miss you.</i>

1895
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,721
David, are you coming?

1896
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,568
We gotta go.
We have to be there by 5:00.

1897
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:21,167
Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming. One second.

1898
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,170
What the hell's she talking about?

1899
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,165
Are you gonna go in?

1900
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,321
Yeah.

1901
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:43,727
Quinn, thank God.

1902
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,490
Hey. You all right? You look like shit.

1903
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,045
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1904
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,129
Oh. Adam.

1905
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,247
We don't have much time.

1906
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,004
Visiting hours are almost up.

1907
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:53,886
Did he say anything?

1908
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,365
What are you talking about?
He can't speak.

1909
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:56,680
He barely knows where he is.

1910
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:59,201
Yeah, I... I know that.

1911
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,960
Did they find anything else out?

1912
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:05,362
Nothing. Just that it happened
after the basketball game.

1913
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,245
Oh, shit.

1914
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:10,131
So they don't know what happened.

1915
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,247
No, they don't know anything,

1916
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,805
but, I mean, look, it's fine.
We'll just, you know,

1917
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:15,400
figure out when the last time
he was safe was and just,

1918
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,409
you know, go back.

1919
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,485
Uh... He was fine in school this morning.

1920
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:20,971
What're you talking about?
That was yesterday.

1921
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,320
He's been here since last night.

1922
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,447
David, why don't you know this?

1923
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,490
I do know, I'm just...
My fucking head, man.

1924
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,250
Look, we gotta do something.

1925
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,200
Okay, I'll get Jessie,
we'll come over tonight.

1926
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,607
No, no, I'll get Jessie, okay?

1927
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,051
Forget it, just come to my house.

1928
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,049
- When?
- I don't know, just tonight.

1929
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,281
- What does that mean?
<i>- I'll</i> call you

1930
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,722
when I'm in touch with her, okay?

1931
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,610
Something is wrong here.

1932
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,124
It's going to be okay.

1933
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,770
It's going to be okay.

1934
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:55,927
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna...

1935
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:00,571
David!

1936
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,082
David! David, where are you going?

1937
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:04,241
Chris, just stay here.

1938
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,400
I don't have a ride!

1939
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,805
- I'm coming back!
- Hey!

1940
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:26,081
Okay, Adam.
When is the last time you were safe?

1941
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,921
Effects of Lollapalooza.

1942
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,520
That's Justin.

1943
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,125
That's a different day.

1944
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,720
Doesn't connect to anything at all.

1945
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,960
Plane crash had nothing to do with it.

1946
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:44,806
Adam.

1947
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,283
The basketball game. Robberies.

1948
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:49,887
Adam...

1949
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,962
Tuesday, 7:00 p.m.

1950
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,290
Everything should be all right.

1951
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,488
Oh, shit.

1952
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:00,971
Tuesday.

1953
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,405
David, what are you doing?

1954
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:11,246
No, Jessie!
Don't come in here! Stay back!

1955
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,411
- Please!
- Where are you going?

1956
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,562
- Don't come in the warp! No!
- David!

1957
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:20,165
Shit.

1958
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,684
David, when are we?

1959
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,003
It's Tuesday.
Adam's still okay.

1960
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,764
I can make it so he never
ends up in the hospital.

1961
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,160
What about everyone else?

1962
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,845
What happened to
"nobodyjumps alone"?

1963
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,046
I know!

1964
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:40,921
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

1965
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,128
I just keep thinking
I can go back and I can fix it myself.

1966
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:45,362
I don't have to worry about anybody else.

1967
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,684
You keep thinking?

1968
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:49,487
What do you mean?

1969
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,688
How many times
have you done this before?

1970
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:52,967
David, how many times

1971
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:54,680
- have you done this before?
- I'm sorry.

1972
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,522
Wait, where are you going? David!

1973
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:58,881
- David!
- Jess!

1974
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,691
You have to stop talking. You're being
too loud. People are gonna hear you.

1975
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,160
I don't care if people can hear me!

1976
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,441
You have to tell me.
What did you change?

1977
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,531
Lollapalooza.

1978
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,726
Wha...

1979
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,203
"Before the world ends..."

1980
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,566
- That's why you and I...
- No, Jess. Listen.

1981
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:21,891
Listen to me.
I didn't mean for this to happen.

1982
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,402
After everything, you're just a liar.

1983
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:27,325
Jess, I understand how this could feel...

1984
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:30,051
You have no idea how this feels!

1985
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,245
You played me!

1986
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:33,805
Like I was just some idiot

1987
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,882
that would just fall for your trick
or something!

1988
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:37,571
Stop it.

1989
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,087
There was no other way
I could have got you.

1990
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,521
You didn't care that it was dangerous?

1991
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,409
That all of your friends could be hurt?

1992
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,806
We had this real connection.

1993
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:48,922
I knew it, and I just went back
and I wanted another chance,

1994
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:52,283
and I... I was the person
that I should have been.

1995
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,401
How do I know

1996
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:55,921
- that you're telling me the truth?
- That's who I should have been.

1997
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,686
How do I know that
this hasn't already happened before?

1998
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,250
Twice before? How do I know that?

1999
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:01,441
No.

2000
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,604
Jesus, David.

2001
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:07,129
I mean, did you ever stop
to think that maybe

2002
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:09,049
I've liked you since
the first time I met you?

2003
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,284
No, I didn't.

2004
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,443
Well, you know what I would have done?

2005
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:22,242
If I was as smart as you,
if I could have built a time machine?

2006
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:23,401
What?

2007
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:27,082
I would have used it
so I could go back and meet you sooner.

2008
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,806
Jess.

2009
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,121
David.

2010
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:36,801
Jessie.

2011
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,645
I love you.

2012
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,722
Guys, I'm here!
David, it's me!

2013
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,290
Shit! You gotta let go.
You gotta let go.

2014
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:44,646
David, it's me.

2015
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:46,685
David, it's me.

2016
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:49,969
David, it's me. David,
it's me. David, it's me.

2017
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:51,926
Jess, no!

2018
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:03,851
Jessie!

2019
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,051
Oh, shit. No, no, no, no.

2020
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:10,366
Jess!

2021
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,006
Oh, God, please. No, no, no. Shit!

2022
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:18,483
Oh, my God, no! I can save you.

2023
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,802
Please, please. Come on. Come on.

2024
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:26,330
Jess, I got you.

2025
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:38,967
Shit! There's gotta be
more hydrogen in here!

2026
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,010
David, it's Quinn! Open up!

2027
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,005
Yo, dude, Jessie's missing
and no one can find her. ls she here?

2028
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:10,809
I screwed up. I screwed up.

2029
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,166
I wasn't trying to hurt Jessie, I swear.

2030
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:14,766
I was just trying to keep Adam
from getting in this accident.

2031
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:17,281
Dude, Adam's fine.

2032
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:19,767
Adam's not in the hospital?

2033
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,564
Jesus! How many times
have you jumped?

2034
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:22,920
It doesn't even matter anymore.

2035
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:26,289
The timelines, you know,
they can, like, crisscross.

2036
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,209
I just need to get more hydrogen.

2037
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:29,611
I'm going back to the beginning.

2038
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,006
Why would you need to go back that far?

2039
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:32,969
Because that's the only way
to stop all this from happening!

2040
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:36,209
I need to stop this machine
from ever being built, Quinn.

2041
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,524
David, think about what you're saying!

2042
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,364
The machine has given us everything!

2043
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,560
We can't just get rid of it!

2044
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,449
It's bigger than just us!
Don't you see that?

2045
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:47,171
- I'm going.
- You are not thinking clearly!

2046
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:49,129
We can't go back to
the way things were before!

2047
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:50,765
Quinn, don't you get it?

2048
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:55,963
The only way to fix this
is to destroy everything.

2049
01:31:56,080 --> 01:32:01,086
Dude, people know who we are.
I've never had that.

2050
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,682
Quinn,
I need you to trust me, okay?

2051
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,525
This is
the Atlanta Police Department.

2052
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,080
- Open up, please.
- Quinn.

2053
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:15,241
Okay.

2054
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:17,482
We're looking
for David Raskin.

2055
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,011
Just be careful, dude.

2056
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:20,960
Open up, please.

2057
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:22,446
You guys go to the back.

2058
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,045
If anybody finds this,

2059
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,849
I want you to know
I didn't mean to hurt anybody

2060
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:28,485
and I didn't kidnap anyone.

2061
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,284
I was just...

2062
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:32,090
I just wanted a second chance.

2063
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,043
My name is David Raskin.

2064
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:38,122
And I built a time machine.

2065
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:42,924
Police Department!
Break down the door.

2066
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,285
Oh, shit. Come on! Come on!

2067
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,206
There he is! Stop him!

2068
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:51,129
David Raskin, Atlanta PD!

2069
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:54,125
Oh, shit!

2070
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:01,291
Oh, shit!

2071
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,808
Oh, shit!

2072
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,281
Oh, shit!

2073
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:10,522
I see him! David, stop!

2074
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:11,801
Get on the ground, David!

2075
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,521
The suspect was last seen
headed towards the school.

2076
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:26,926
You guys take the front.

2077
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,321
Stevens, come with me
around the back. Let's move!

2078
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:31,529
Take the other side. Let's go.

2079
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,405
Oh, shit!

2080
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:22,523
Suspect inside.

2081
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:30,245
Kick down the door.
Kick down the door. Go!

2082
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,602
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

2083
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:47,446
<i>So you take my keys
and you disappear forever.</i>

2084
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:50,560
<i>I need to go back
to the beginning.</i>

2085
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:52,882
The timelines crisscross...

2086
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:55,122
- Ten years total.
- You lookjust like him.

2087
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:56,605
- I won't be gone long.
- Promise?

2088
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:57,961
You think you'll go back to save him?

2089
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,127
<i>Save him?</i>

2090
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,809
Guys, I'm so sorry.

2091
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,161
Christina.

2092
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:15,483
Sweetie, I have to go. I have to go.

2093
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,444
What are you doing in my house?

2094
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:51,441
David?

2095
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,731
Hi, Dad.

2096
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,888
You figured it out.

2097
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:05,767
Yeah.

2098
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:10,087
I don't...

2099
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:12,809
I've got so many questions.

2100
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:14,081
We can't.

2101
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,806
I can't.

2102
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:18,888
We were wrong.

2103
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:21,369
<i>There are no second chances.</i>

2104
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:29,769
Are you okay?

2105
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:40,604
I'm going to be okay.

2106
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,969
Hey, Dad.
Dad, are you down there?

2107
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:50,611
I think it's time for you
to say goodbye to your son.

2108
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:02,605
I'm proud of you.

2109
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:10,087
Who were you talking to, Dad?

2110
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,843
Just a friend.

2111
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,644
He's here to fix something.

2112
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:19,970
Where are you going?
It's my birthday.

2113
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:23,288
You caught me, pal.
You know I wouldn't be leaving

2114
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:26,682
unless it was real important.
I won't be gone long.

2115
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,165
Promise?

2116
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,005
Of course I promise.

2117
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:35,049
I'll tell you what. Uh, why don't you...

2118
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:37,561
- Time me.
- Time me.

2119
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:52,641
You guys ready for this?

2120
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:53,801
<i>What is this?</i>

2121
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:57,727
Whoo!

2122
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,724
Did you just check out my ass?

2123
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,041
Uh, yeah.

2124
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,005
It's yesterday!

2125
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:05,491
<i>This song goes out
to Jessie Pierce.</i>

2126
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:06,846
He is pretty smart, huh?

2127
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,080
Stay out of my perfume.

2128
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:10,571
<i>I'd go back and meet you sooner.</i>

2129
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,201
"Before the world ends,
I have to fall in love."

2130
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,211
<i>I love you.</i>

2131
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:45,484
What are you, sulking?

2132
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:47,085
God!
You scared the shit out of me.

2133
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:51,085
I'm not sulking.

2134
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:52,726
Why are you up here?

2135
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,327
Uh...

2136
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:55,526
It's dumb. You know,

2137
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,921
there's this one
last scholarship where I have to

2138
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:01,169
submit a proposal
for an experiment and I thought

2139
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,481
maybe if I got it,
Mom wouldn't have to sell the house.

2140
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:04,681
Huh.

2141
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:07,366
Dad must have a million ideas
lying around up here.

2142
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:08,606
I don't know, Chris.

2143
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:10,085
I mean, I thought there'd be
something up here.

2144
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:12,601
I can't find anything I can use.

2145
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,404
Hey, what is this?

2146
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,408
When did we get a video camera?

2147
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:27,121
Oh, it's right here.
This is Dad's old camera.

2148
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:29,447
Did Dad have two old cameras?

2149
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:32,524
Uh, I don't know. Yeah. I guess.

2150
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:34,090
They both say "Property of Ben Raskin."

2151
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:35,366
Yeah, let me see.

2152
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:38,728
Weird. Do they work?

2153
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,131
Yeah, it's playing.

2154
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:42,971
<i>When did we get a video camera?</i>

2155
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:45,970
<i>Oh, that's Dad's old camera.
Remember that?</i>

2156
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:49,926
<i>Yeah.
Hey, look, it still works.</i>

2157
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:56,125
I mean, what the hell
is he supposed to say to her?

2158
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:57,969
He can't just walk up to her and be like...

2159
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,606
Would you just be quiet?

2160
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:04,486
Are you trying to communicate with me...

2161
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,931
Telepathically.

2162
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:10,965
How did you know I was gonna say that?

2163
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:15,331
This is gonna sound crazy,

2164
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,841
but I think we're
about to change the world.

2164
