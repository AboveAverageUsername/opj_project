{4693}{4731}Let me play|the other side then.
{4733}{4803}No, Rayette,|it's not a question of sides.

{4882}{4946}Then let me sing one for ya.|When there's a...
{4948}{4990}Hold it, hold it.
{5015}{5067}- Oh, Bobby!|- What?

{5108}{5154}You said you're gonna help me|pick a song.
{5156}{5223}- I did?|- I'm gonna cut off your damn water.
{5225}{5278}I swear.

{5481}{5582}Your whole damn family can play|some type of musical instrument.
{5584}{5676}All I'm askin' is for you|to help me improve my musical talent.
{5678}{5753}And you'd think you would.
{5755}{5829}Dipesto, why don't you|take that sign off your tit...
{5831}{5914}and you and me go out|and have us a real good time.
{5947}{5994}Where are we going?

{6655}{6702}You can sing the song.
{6919}{6978}You are never satisfied.
{7039}{7086}That's right.
{7161}{7219}Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
{7457}{7509}All right, here it is.
{7686}{7745}They were all set up right for ya.
{7747}{7798}Get right in there, Dipesto.
{7800}{7875}- Just relax.|- Come on, Rayette.
{7877}{7935}Watch that left foot.|Left foot forward.
{8124}{8208}Not too much of a match,|is it, Elton?
{8325}{8358}In the gutter.|Isn't that wonderful?
{8360}{8419}Too heavy for me, honey.
{8421}{8484}The pins, you know. I can't see them.|I can't make 'em out.
{8486}{8524}Squint. I squint.
{8525}{8605}There they are at the end|of these little boards.
{8607}{8671}You notice 'em leading down,|just spot and follow through.
{8673}{8699}But there's so many.
{8701}{8752}- What's that for?|- That's for luck.
{8754}{8800}- Oh, you're crazy.|- Go show Ray how to do it.
{8802}{8879}- You slobbered on me.|- It ain't the first time.
{8881}{8945}Watch this.
{8946}{9027}There she is. She's doin'|a little variation on the Apache Shift.
{9029}{9051}I taught her that.
{9133}{9205}- Are you mad at me?|- No, I'm not mad at ya, honey.
{9207}{9245}It'll be all right.
{9247}{9332}- Look at me and tell me you're not mad.|- I'm not mad at you.
{9437}{9500}- Let's see you beat it.|- I'll show you how it gets done.
{9501}{9540}Don't talk about it. Do it.
{9541}{9568}Isn't he pretty?
{9861}{9932}Show me something.|Give me spirit. Give me something.
{10079}{10164}That stupid thing|just goes all cocky-wobbly, honey.
{10166}{10237}- Just do what I tell ya.|- I did, didn't I, EI?
{10238}{10266}You got another ball coming.
{10386}{10432}- Come on!|- Relax, Ray. That's all.
{10537}{10559}Attaboy!
{10613}{10715}That was real good, wasn't it?|I finally did it.
{10717}{10801}Great. You throw the big Zs|for 19 frames...
{10803}{10897}and then you throw a strike|on the last ball of a losin' game.
{10898}{10986}Just wonderful.|Wasn't that wonderful, ladies?
{10988}{11058}- Are you talking to us?|- Wonderful.
{11103}{11158}I guess I'll go wait in the car.
{11160}{11218}Why don't you go wait in the car?
{11220}{11280}I will.|I'll wait there right now.
{11281}{11335}One minute, honey,|and I'll go with you.
{11506}{11595}Me and Stoney got to get on home,|relieve the sitter.
{11597}{11677}Why don't you and Ray|just come on by the place?
{11679}{11733}All right, why don't you go on?
{11735}{11826}Here, I'll take care|of the beers.
{11828}{11891}And would you walk Rayette|with ya?
{11893}{11939}- Sure.|- Thanks.
{12439}{12491}- What do we owe you?|- Four dollars, sir.
{12493}{12531}Okay.
{12622}{12669}- Here's a five. Thanks very much.|- Thank you.
{12778}{12831}We've been wanting to ask you.
{12833}{12900}You're on the TV, aren't ya?
{12926}{12964}Am I?
{12966}{13097}She says you're the guy|that sells all the cars on TV.
{13161}{13210}I might have sold a few cars.
{13212}{13304}I told ya! My name's Shirley,|but they call me Betty.
{13306}{13371}Her name's Twinky.
{13372}{13443}- Twinky?|- Yeah, 'cause she's so Twinky.
{13469}{13540}Boy, oh, boy.|Well, Betty and Twinky...
{13541}{13615}it sure is nice|talking to you girls.
{13616}{13667}I wish I had some more time.
{13669}{13726}- That's a wig you wear, isn't it?|- Me?
{13728}{13789}Yeah, I told her it was you,|but that you're wearing a wig...
{13791}{13900}'cause on TV,|you're mostly all bald up there.
{13952}{14027}Your friend's real, real sharp.
{14029}{14109}I don't wear the wig on TV...
{14111}{14191}because if you're gonna be in front of|two and a half million people...
{14192}{14243}you've got to be sincere.
{14244}{14341}I mean, I like to wear it when I'm in|bowling alleys and slipping around.
{14343}{14400}I think it gives me a little class.|What do you think?
{14401}{14505}Yeah, but I can see|a little bit of the net up there.
{14507}{14557}That's what give it away.
{14559}{14605}A little net.
{14650}{14709}I wish I had more time|to talk to you girls...
{14711}{14779}but I have to...
{14780}{14819}I'Il...
{15095}{15163}Come on, Ray.|We're gonna go over to Elton's.
{15164}{15220}I'm not.
{15221}{15277}You're just gonna sit here?
{15279}{15331}Yes.
{15333}{15418}Okay, I hope|no one hits on you.
{15420}{15466}I hope they do.
{15516}{15571}Okay.
{15572}{15619}See you later.
{16219}{16313}No one would want to hit on you.|You look too pathetic.
{16374}{16448}Come on, Dipesto.|We can still have a good time.
{16494}{16555}You're the pathetic one,|not me.
{16602}{16652}I'm going over to Elton's.
{16767}{16829}I am not a piece of crap.
{16947}{17011}I'm sorry.
{17012}{17071}You treat me like I was.
{17133}{17259}Go slip around|right before my face...
{17260}{17335}in front of Elton and Stoney|that way.
{17372}{17462}What do you imagine they think|of somebody you treat like that?
{17464}{17510}Now, now, Ray.
{17644}{17727}Sweetheart, Elton and Stoney know|that I love you.
{17728}{17819}They're just gonna think that I'm not|too nice a guy, which I'm not...
{17821}{17909}and that you're a real hell of|a good person for puttin' up with me.
{17911}{17969}That's all.
{17971}{18029}Just find me dead one time.
{18080}{18131}You'II just kill me.
{18202}{18253}Come on, be a good girl.
{18296}{18369}If you ever really get up|and leave me...
{18371}{18430}you'll read about it|in the newsprint.
{18432}{18501}I'm not gonna get up|and leave you.
{18655}{18701}Now, come on.
{18703}{18769}Let's go over to Elton's|and have a good time.
{18840}{18889}You love me, Bobby?
{18952}{18999}What do you think?
{19935}{19962}Fuck.
{19991}{20047}You got banana on your face.
{20048}{20095}I do?
{20163}{20250}I still ain't figured out|how you got me workin' back out here.
{20291}{20333}I got you to work out here?
{20335}{20427}I ain't figured out how you let me|get you to work on these rigs.
{20429}{20523}I've never worked on these before.|You've worked on 'em before.
{20525}{20609}I can't figure out|how you let me get us out here.
{20611}{20657}Somebody had to look out for ya.
{20719}{20746}You're a mess.
{20815}{20842}You're crazy.
{21262}{21329}- I'm gonna bet two dollars right off.|- I'm in.
{21331}{21378}I think you're bullshitting me.
{21379}{21442}- What have you got?|- Pair of nines.
{21443}{21509}- Can you beat two pair?|- There's three aces right there.
{21551}{21606}I got me a hand.
{21607}{21682}It's time for me to go home.|See you in the mornin'.
{21684}{21714}See you in the morning.
{21716}{21799}I don't know if I'm goin' out there|tomorrow at all.
{21800}{21902}I got a lot of money|tied up in everything I've got.
{21946}{22010}I don't want no chains|going around and all this.
{22012}{22059}It's all right,|but I prefer cardplaying.
{22061}{22129}Where is it? What the hell is going on|in the middle of this game?
{22131}{22193}People talking and all.|We got money here or what?
{22195}{22275}Ride a cockhorse|to Banbury Cross
{22277}{22338}To Banbury Cross|we go
{22395}{22467}When I was four...|just four years old...
{22469}{22522}I went to my mother...
{22524}{22572}and I said,|"What's this hole in my chin?"
{22574}{22651}I saw this dimple in my chin|and didn't know what it was.
{22653}{22704}Get what my mother says.
{22706}{22786}She says, "When you're born,|you go on an assembly line past God.
{22788}{22853}If He likes you,|He says, 'You cute little thing'...
{22855}{22881}and you get dimples there.
{22883}{22961}If He doesn't like you,|He goes, 'Go away."'
{22963}{23074}So, about six months later,|my mother caught me saying my prayers.
{23076}{23135}I was going, "Now I lay me|down to sleep."
{23137}{23211}Mother says, "What are you|covering up your chin for?"
{23213}{23343}And I said, "Because if I cover up|the hole, maybe He'll listen to me."
{24245}{24324}I look unfit to you, Elton?|I'm fit!
{24326}{24466}If you haven't got your ticket yet|you'd better order it
{24467}{24534}He'll wet your carpet|and he'll fertilize your grass
{24536}{24664}He's got three white feet|and a hole in his ass
{24710}{24768}Don't you know no songs|about women or nothin'?
{24799}{24880}Yeah, but I'm just too loaded|to think of 'em now.
{24882}{24901}Watch out for all this traffic.
{24901}{24930}Watch out for all this traffic.
{24932}{25006}- Oh, God.|- I ain't in no hurry.
{25008}{25125}Believe starting off your day|like this, going to work?
{25126}{25185}Unbelievable.|Let me have a drink, will ya?
{25222}{25260}Thanks, EI.
{25332}{25378}Oh, boy, that's tough|in the morning.
{25406}{25476}What the hell|are these people doing here?
{25586}{25649}Isn't this some goddamn thing?
{25650}{25697}Jesus Christ!
{25855}{25937}I can't stand this goddamn freeway.
{26050}{26108}I heard ya! Why don't you|flash your lights...
{26110}{26185}so we can see|what else you got for Christmas?
{26280}{26306}Yeah, yeah, yeah.
{26308}{26363}Where you going?
{26482}{26560}Why don't we all line up|like a goddamn bunch of ants...
{26562}{26634}in the most beautiful part|of the day!
{26916}{26974}Hey, get off my car.
{27710}{27759}Oh, shit. What's he doing?
{28392}{28448}Play it!
{28605}{28666}Quit foolin' around!|Come on!
{28723}{28776}Bobby, he's turning!
{28821}{28867}Will you hold your horses?
{31362}{31442}I was with Elton|last night, Rayette.
{31444}{31490}It's the truth.
{32122}{32169}You son of a bitch.
{32849}{32916}Natalie, be quiet.|Come on, reach for it.
{32917}{32992}Come on. Good girl.
{33304}{33382}- Isn't he sweet?|- I can't see the set.
{33384}{33472}You take him for a while.|Go ahead now.
{33473}{33514}How ya doin'?
{33560}{33626}You ought to get yourself|one of them little things.
{33788}{33896}That's it. He crushed that one too.|Then I won't get any.
{33898}{33963}Bless my soul.|It's a new harmonica.
{33965}{34024}- That's for your birthday.|- My birthday?
{34026}{34090}How do you know when my birthday is?
{34092}{34138}I don't know myself.
{34222}{34280}The kitchen's on fire, Stoney.
{34340}{34396}Your mother's just died.
{34397}{34456}- Bye-bye.|- Bye.
{34457}{34504}- Bye.|- See ya, Elton.
{34537}{34583}So long.
{34585}{34632}Incidentally,|what's his name?
{34634}{34714}You just love that little baby,|don't you?
{34759}{34815}Well, what if she was?
{34817}{34891}I can't see nothing|so bad in that.
{34893}{34989}Well, what if I were to let you in|on a little secret that she is?
{35022}{35048}That's right.
{35050}{35104}She told me.
{35106}{35179}She's all torn up about it, too,|which I hate to see.
{35209}{35280}Isn't it something|you just have to face up to?
{35282}{35382}I'll tell ya, somewhere along the line,|you even get to likin' the whole idea.
{35384}{35461}When Stoney first give me the news,|I could've shit.
{35580}{35646}Well, isn't that nice?
{35648}{35682}It's ridiculous.
{35684}{35777}I'm listening to some cracker asshole|who lives in a trailer park...
{35779}{35825}compare his life to mine.
{35924}{36022}Keep on telling me about the good life,|because it makes me puke.
{36024}{36136}If you're saying you're something|better than I am, that's something else.
{36138}{36182}But I can't say much of someone...
{36184}{36240}who could leave a woman|in a situation like this...
{36241}{36279}and feel easy about it.
{36281}{36312}That's all I have to say.
{36314}{36360}I'm glad that's all|you got to say...
{36362}{36422}because I'm about|as goddamn tired of your mouth...
{36424}{36495}as I am working|on the goddamn job!
{36618}{36664}Shit ass!
{37006}{37048}Hey, Longcipher!
{37216}{37240}I'm quitting.
{37242}{37310}Do you hear me?|I said I'm quitting.
{37312}{37366}I don't give a damn|what you do.
{37368}{37437}I'm glad to get rid|of both of you dumb guys.
{37822}{37888}Hey, what's going on?
{38279}{38333}Don't do that, Bob.|Don't mix in.
{38335}{38411}They've got the right, Bob.|It's the law.
{38904}{38955}Don't you think|you could just leave him?
{38957}{39045}If he had known who you were,|he wouldn't have done that. Would you?
{39047}{39101}What the hell's going on?
{39103}{39147}All right, let him go.
{39191}{39237}What's going on?
{39239}{39352}I got accused of robbing|a filling station. Didn't I tell ya?
{39354}{39426}I just got wild|and jumped my bail.
{39428}{39530}They come runnin' at me a whole year|later. Isn't that something?
{39596}{39639}Tell Stoney for me, ya hear?
{41457}{41522}Hi. Miss Dupea?
{41523}{41580}- Upstairs. Up those stairs.|- Thank you.
{42759}{42806}There she goes again.
{42839}{42909}My one-year-old can carry a tune|better than that.
{43067}{43101}Miss Dupea.
{43185}{43282}- Miss Dupea.|- Yes?
{43284}{43355}I'd like to remind you again|that this is not an opera...
{43357}{43404}or a musical comedy.
{43471}{43526}Sorry. Was I singing again?
{43528}{43587}If you want to call it that.
{43588}{43637}Wait. You have simply to tell me.
{43639}{43681}That's all.
{43683}{43733}That's exactly|what I am doing again.
{43735}{43815}Must you let me get two thirds|of the way through the movement?
{43817}{43930}- This is tiring me.|- I have another suggestion.
{43932}{43998}- Why don't we take a break?|- For pity's sake.
{44000}{44081}- Is she gonna cry again?|- I don't wanna take a break.
{44083}{44186}Some coffee. What would you like|in your coffee, Miss Dupea?
{44187}{44247}- Tea.|- One tea.
{44249}{44295}Tell her Bobby's here.
{44297}{44335}Bobby's here.
{44423}{44469}Oh, my goodness!
{44543}{44607}Robert Eroica.
{44850}{44896}I can't look at you.
{44922}{44968}Well, don't, then.
{45063}{45130}You always do this to me.
{45132}{45198}I don't mean to.|Here's your tea, Tita.
{45199}{45279}Thank you.|Don't put it there.
{45281}{45335}Why? What's wrong?
{45337}{45426}This is a very special CB 275.
{45463}{45506}No kidding.
{45507}{45614}It has absolutely|no objectionable idiosyncrasies.
{45799}{45870}I have to talk seriously to you.
{45871}{45945}Everybody still living|up on the island?
{45947}{46030}Well, at the moment,|there's really just...
{46031}{46132}Daddy, Carl and myself,|and Van Oost.
{46134}{46174}- Who's Van Oost?|- Catherine.
{46176}{46254}She's a pianist.|She's working with Carl.
{46255}{46317}Carl's a fiddler.|What's he doing coaching piano?
{46319}{46378}Well, eleven months ago...
{46380}{46493}he was on his bicycle on his way|to the post office in the village...
{46494}{46593}and he ran straight into a jeep|and sprained his neck.
{46595}{46656}Strained his neck?
{46658}{46743}That's not funny.|He permanently sprained his neck.
{46745}{46872}Since then, it's been extremely painful|for him to tuck the violin...
{46874}{46944}Crashes into a jeep|and totals his neck.
{47137}{47201}I have to tell you.
{47231}{47278}Daddy's very ill.
{47483}{47552}- What?|- He's had two strokes.
{47709}{47755}He's not...
{47805}{47869}They feel, maybe,|he might not recover from it.
{47870}{47917}Don't tell me about this.
{48051}{48175}But don't you think it's right|that you should see him at least once?
{48177}{48259}- Miss Dupea.|- Just a minute, please.
{48261}{48316}Don't you think it's right|you should see him?
{48318}{48364}Yeah, I guess so.
{48366}{48441}I'm going back up tonight.|Will you come with me?
{48505}{48559}I'd rather drive up.
{48561}{48620}Maybe I'II go|into Canada after.
{48670}{48750}I'm not gonna stay long.|One week at the most.
{48751}{48798}I know.
{48883}{48930}Well...
{48994}{49032}Come on.|I'll walk you out.
{49076}{49122}I'll be back|in two minutes.
{49124}{49171}We've had our break, Miss Dupea.
{49173}{49261}- They hate me, I feel.|- Maybe you better stay.
{49314}{49404}I want to talk to you|about so many things.
{49406}{49460}I'll be seeing you|in a couple of days.
{49497}{49556}I'm so glad.
{49558}{49605}Me too.
{49622}{49669}Bye.
{52141}{52188}Hello?
{52337}{52384}You got the day off?
{52671}{52717}Are you sick?
{52893}{52940}Guess you heard|about Elton.
{53057}{53120}Okay, I got your point.|I hope you didn't strain yourself...
{53121}{53180}getting in here|before I hit the back door.
{53332}{53400}I have to go home.
{53401}{53448}My father's sick.
{53627}{53661}I'll be gone|for two or three weeks.
{53697}{53752}You'll be gone period.
{54141}{54200}I'II try and call you|from up there.
{54521}{54563}Come on, Dipesto.
{54565}{54636}I never told you|it would work out to anything.
{54681}{54727}Did I?
{54830}{54893}I'll send you some money.|That's all I can do.
{54991}{55049}I'II try and call you|from up there.
{55163}{55209}Bye, Ray.
{56377}{56428}You wanna go with me?
{57653}{57766}There's been hot spells|and cold spells ever since we've met
{57768}{57833}I've seen your big fires|your small fires
{57835}{57878}But I won't give up yet
{57880}{57940}Oh, someday you'll yearn
{57942}{58009}'Cause your heart's gonna burn
{58011}{58119}For that old familiar glow
{58121}{58156}You'll be first
{58157}{58231}- Like it?|- I love it.
{58258}{58327}You'll be burned out|or smoked out
{58328}{58421}And come back to me|I know
{58423}{58523}- What the hell are they doing?|- Is that an accident?
{58626}{58707}Who was driving?|You were driving!
{58708}{58739}What's going on?
{58767}{58798}Rotate, mack!
{58852}{58912}Look at my car.
{58914}{58996}I just bought it brand-new from a used|car lot, and the steering goes to pot.
{58998}{59056}- You're lucky nobody was hurt.|- Can you give us a lift?
{59058}{59092}Come on, Terry!|We got a ride!
{59094}{59161}You're gonna give those people|a lift?
{59163}{59273}- I can't just leave them here.|- I'd like to punch that son of a bitch.
{59275}{59341}Jesus. What a rude person.
{59419}{59489}- What's your name?|- Palm Apodaca.
{59539}{59601}- What's your name?|- Terry Grouse.
{59651}{59692}What?
{59694}{59749}How far are you going?
{59751}{59805}Washington.
{59807}{59897}We'll get off in Washington.|We'll hook a ride.
{59899}{59985}- Where are you going?|- Alaska.
{59987}{60070}Alaska?|What, are you on vacation?
{60072}{60139}She wants to live there|because it's cleaner.
{60140}{60199}Cleaner?|Cleaner than what?
{60243}{60283}You don't have to tell everybody.
{60285}{60353}Soon, they'll all go,|and it won't be so clean.
{60381}{60435}What makes you think it's cleaner?
{60437}{60537}I saw a picture of it.|Alaska's very clean.
{60539}{60615}It appeared to look|very white to me.
{60616}{60667}Don't you think?
{60669}{60768}Yep. That was before|the big thaw.
{60770}{60804}Before the what?
{61225}{61312}I had to leave this place because|I got depressed seeing all the crap.
{61339}{61386}The thing is,|they're making more crap.
{61388}{61456}They got so many stores|and stuff and junk full of crap.
{61458}{61521}- I can't believe it.|- Who?
{61523}{61621}Who?|Man, that's who.
{61623}{61681}Pretty soon, there won't be|any room for man.
{61715}{61805}They're selling more crap that|people buy than you can imagine.
{61807}{61841}Crap.
{61876}{61925}I believe everybody should have|a big hole...
{61927}{61969}where they throw the stuff in|and burn it.
{61971}{62044}They'd never find a hole|big enough. Never.
{62046}{62089}Take me. Look at me.
{62091}{62181}When I was just one person,|before I was with Bobby...
{62183}{62266}I was collecting onto me more garbage|every day...
{62267}{62347}till I was gettin' to thinkin'|that I should get a disposal.
{62348}{62418}Disposal?|What's that, but more crap?
{62419}{62469}I've never seen such crap.
{62471}{62575}- Mass production is what does it.|- Mass? You're not that clean either.
{62577}{62641}Wait. I'm not that neat,|but I am clean.
{62643}{62735}You're not that bad.|But some people.
{62736}{62819}People's homes, just filth.|I've been in people's homes...
{62821}{62905}In my personal observation,|more people are neat than clean.
{62907}{62941}I don't see that.
{62943}{63028}I'm seeing more filth.|A lot of filth.
{63030}{63090}What they need to do every day,|no, once in a while...
{63092}{63171}is do a cockroach thing|where they spray the homes.
{63172}{63225}Imagine if their doors|were painted a pretty color...
{63227}{63261}and they had a pot outside.
{63263}{63319}- Yeah, could be adorable.|- And they picked up.
{63320}{63435}Then it wouldn't be filthy|with Coke bottles and whiskey and...
{63437}{63483}those signs everywhere,|they should be erased!
{63485}{63557}All those signs selling you crap|and more crap and more crap.
{63559}{63651}I don't know.|I don't even want to talk about it.
{63652}{63718}- Well...|- It's just filthy. People are filthy.
{63720}{63787}I think that's the biggest thing|that's wrong with people.
{63789}{63829}They'd be less violent|if they were clean...
{63831}{63889}because then they wouldn't have|anybody to pick on.
{63916}{63951}Dirt.
{63952}{64066}Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad.|It's filth. Filth is bad.
{64067}{64129}That's what starts maggots|and riots.
{64155}{64226}Follow that truck.|They know the best places to stop.
{64227}{64308}- That's an old maid's tale.|- Bullshit.
{64331}{64390}Only truck drivers know|the best places to stop.
{64391}{64440}Salesman and cops are.
{64442}{64488}If you'd ever waitressed, honey,|you'd know.
{64490}{64609}- Don't call me honey, mack.|- Don't call me mack, honey.
{64643}{64718}I wouldn't be a waitress.|They're nasty and full of crap.
{64719}{64784}You just hold on to your tongue.
{64786}{64826}Hold on to this.
{64851}{64897}If you think you can talk to me|like that...
{64899}{64956}Shut up, all of ya!
{65077}{65134}I'd like a plain omelet.
{65135}{65193}No potatoes.|Tomatoes instead.
{65195}{65247}A cup of coffee|and wheat toast.
{65249}{65284}No substitutions.
{65286}{65360}What do you mean?|You don't have any tomatoes?
{65362}{65444}Only what's on the menu. You can have|number two, a plain omelet.
{65446}{65481}It comes with fries and rolls.
{65510}{65584}I know, but it's not|what I want.
{65586}{65632}- Make up your mind.|- Wait.
{65634}{65709}I have made up my mind.|I'd like a plain omelet.
{65711}{65758}No potatoes on the plate.
{65759}{65826}A cup of coffee and a side order|of wheat toast.
{65827}{65887}I'm sorry, we don't have|any side orders of toast.
{65889}{65948}I'II give you an English muffin|or a coffee roll.
{65950}{66056}No side orders of toast?|You make sandwiches, don't you?
{66083}{66121}Would you like to talk|to the manager?
{66123}{66194}- Hey, mack.|- Shut up.
{66195}{66269}You've got bread|and a toaster of some kind?
{66271}{66308}I don't make the rules.
{66310}{66383}I'll make it|as easy for you as I can.
{66385}{66505}I'd like a plain omelet and|a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast.
{66506}{66602}No mayonnaise, no butter, no lettuce,|and a cup of coffee.
{66604}{66661}A number two.|A chicken sal san.
{66663}{66731}Hold the butter, the lettuce|and the mayonnaise.
{66733}{66799}And a cup of coffee.|Anything else?
{66801}{66893}Yeah, now all you have to do is|hold the chicken, bring me the toast...
{66894}{66950}give me a check|for a chicken salad sandwich...
{66951}{66991}and you haven't broken|any rules.
{66993}{67047}You want me|to hold the chicken, huh?
{67049}{67112}I want you to hold it|between your knees.
{67169}{67198}See that sign?
{67199}{67234}Yes, you all have to leave.
{67235}{67321}I'm not taking any more|of your smartness and sarcasm.
{67322}{67369}You see this sign?
{67417}{67498}Fantastic that you could|figure that out...
{67499}{67575}so that you could come up|with a way to get your toast.
{67577}{67613}Yeah? Well,|I didn't get it, did I?
{67614}{67718}No, but it was very clever.|I would've just punched her out.
{67830}{67893}People.
{67895}{67945}Animals are not like that.
{67978}{68077}They're always cleaning themselves.|Did you ever see pigeons?
{68138}{68194}He's always picking on himself|and his friends.
{68195}{68252}They're always picking bugs|out of their hair.
{68254}{68300}Monkeys too.
{68302}{68368}Except they do something|out in the open that I don't go for.
{68482}{68564}I read where they invented|this car that runs on...
{68648}{68679}When you boil water?
{68726}{68752}Steam.
{68754}{68827}Right. A car you could ride in|and not cause a stink.
{68829}{68913}Do you know they will not|even let us have it?
{68914}{68958}Can you believe it?
{68960}{69017}Why? Man!
{69018}{69069}He likes to create a stink.
{69070}{69150}I've seen filth|that you wouldn't believe.
{69151}{69206}What a stink.
{69208}{69254}I don't even wanna talk about it.
{70642}{70720}You depressed|about your daddy, hon?
{70778}{70836}I imagine it's me, then.|Isn't it?
{70866}{70921}Is what you?
{70922}{70979}Are you depressed|I come along?
{71039}{71086}Who says I'm depressed?
{71118}{71178}Is that a happy face I see?
{71283}{71370}'Cause if it is, I'II just|catch a Greyhound back.
{71420}{71502}You're not gonna kill yourself|this time. I wish I'd known.
{71892}{71950}Well...
{71952}{72040}I don't know if I'm going|to be able to get to sleep.
{72042}{72088}Hint, hint.
{72223}{72307}Guess I'll have to count|the sheep.
{72309}{72379}One, two...
{72381}{72460}three, four...
{72462}{72560}five, six...
{72562}{72608}seven...
{72642}{72740}Look at this old cold shoulder.
{72790}{72858}What am I going to do about it?
{73010}{73108}If you wouldn't open your mouth,|everything would be just fine.
{73208}{73254}Tick a lock.
{73515}{73600}Why can't I go to your family's house?|Give me one good reason.
{73602}{73659}I have to see|what's going on first.
{73661}{73717}My father's sick.|You understand?
{73718}{73780}They wouldn't be prepared|for my bringing anyone.
{73782}{73845}How long do I have to twiddle|my thumbs here?
{73846}{73909}Look, if you can't do|what I'm asking you...
{73910}{73995}why don't you just take the money|and go back south with it?
{73997}{74048}Honey, don't talk like that.
{74050}{74144}Would you try and understand?|This is not something that I want to do.
{74146}{74214}Jesus Christ. You ought to know me|well enough for that.
{74244}{74274}All right.
{74316}{74384}It'll be all right.|There's stuff for me to do.
{74386}{74453}They've got magazines in there,|and the TV, right?
{74454}{74485}Yeah.
{74486}{74547}I'll try and call you|in a couple of days.
{74597}{74625}All right.
{74650}{74697}Bye.
{79956}{80026}He doesn't even know|who the hell I am.
{80548}{80594}- How long...|- Remember Mother used to...
{80596}{80642}- Excuse me.|- Excuse me.
{80644}{80695}Go ahead. Excuse me.
{80697}{80787}I wanted to ask Robert|how long he's been away from here.
{80788}{80840}Three years.
{80842}{80905}No, it's more like two years,|isn't it, hmm?
{80907}{80941}It's been more than that, Carl.
{80943}{81031}Tita, you have no sense of timing|away from the piano.
{81032}{81076}I don't think that's true.
{81078}{81113}It's true.
{81115}{81157}What have you been doing|since then?
{81159}{81255}Odd jobs of work here and there.|Nothing too interesting.
{81257}{81311}You no longer play at all?
{81312}{81359}You know, before my misfortune...
{81360}{81425}I'm not sure|you're aware of my accident.
{81427}{81477}Yeah. Tita was telling me|about it.
{81479}{81577}It's very difficult for me|to turn my neck, this way especially.
{81579}{81699}If I want to look at Catherine,|I have to shift my whole body around.
{81701}{81760}I was real sorry|to hear about it, Carl.
{81761}{81831}I said, I was real sorry|to hear about it.
{81832}{81867}Anyway, as I was saying...
{81892}{81975}Catherine, what was I saying, hmm?
{81977}{82031}You were saying something|about something...
{82033}{82109}that happened around the time|of the accident.
{82111}{82172}Oh, yes!|Just before the accident.
{82174}{82225}After I'd come off tour|with the Betanthaller Quartet...
{82227}{82293}Father and Herbert and I|had a summit conference concerning you.
{82295}{82397}A summit conference? Where was I,|polishing silver behind the coal bin?
{82399}{82472}I don't know where you were,|penis envy.
{82474}{82511}I hope I didn't hear that.
{82541}{82577}Nevertheless...
{82579}{82625}they wanted to hire a detective|to ferret you out.
{82627}{82691}I talked them out of it because I felt|that whatever you were doing...
{82693}{82750}you had a perfect right to do|no matter how...
{82752}{82799}nonsensical your adventures|might be.
{82801}{82880}- It was as simple as that.|- I really appreciate it.
{82882}{82983}I don't think you ought to imply|Daddy was wrong in front of Daddy.
{82985}{83038}Don't force him that way, Spicer.
{83081}{83118}How long have you been here?
{83120}{83176}Oh, only two months.
{83212}{83282}Well, satiety is|my father and mother.
{83350}{83396}Carl?
{83398}{83487}If you're finished,|I think I'd like to go do some work.
{83489}{83524}Certainly, dear.
{83526}{83575}Excuse me.|See you later.
{83612}{83662}I hope you feel|right at home, Robert.
{83664}{83710}I feel fine.
{84479}{84550}He has ways|of communicating, Robert.
{84552}{84678}I can tell when he's expressing approval|or disapproval, just from his eyes.
{84680}{84762}Yeah. Some range.
{84796}{84893}I can't take much more of seeing him|sitting there like a stone.
{84895}{84927}It's not that bad.
{84929}{84971}Yes, it is.
{84992}{85042}Will you stay a while?
{85149}{85195}I don't know.
{85993}{86075}Breathe.|All right.
{86141}{86179}Now, once more.
{86523}{86564}- Hello.|- Hi.
{86566}{86623}I've been looking all over for you.
{86624}{86682}- You have? I went riding.|- Riding?
{86683}{86755}- Mm-hmm.|- That's dangerous, you know.
{86756}{86794}Riding?
{86795}{86896}You play the piano all day, then jump|on a horse, you could get cramps.
{86935}{86976}Well, I like to ride.
{86978}{87045}Rain or shine, I do it|any chance I can get.
{87047}{87103}- It's very invigorating.|- Is it?
{87105}{87143}Yes.
{87145}{87234}I don't like to get|too invigorated myself.
{87235}{87286}You don't?
{87288}{87328}What else do you do?
{87330}{87399}Well, there's fishing, boating.
{87401}{87486}There's concerts on the mainland.
{87519}{87582}I feel silly telling you.|This is really your home.
{87584}{87635}You know better than I|what there is to do.
{87637}{87684}Nothing.
{87716}{87783}- Nothing?|- Nothing.
{87811}{87862}It must be very boring|for you here.
{87864}{87919}That's right.
{87921}{87990}I find that hard to comprehend.
{87991}{88070}I don't think|I've ever been bored. Excuse me.
{88225}{88263}What are you doing right now?
{88265}{88371}Right now I plan to take|a hot tub and soak myself.
{88373}{88427}Then after that?
{88429}{88537}After that I plan to read some music|and rest for a while.
{88539}{88609}Tomorrow then?
{88611}{88682}Tomorrow.|Tomorrow's a full practice day.
{88683}{88753}But the day after tomorrow,|I will be free.
{88755}{88830}Carl has hydrotherapy|on Tuesdays.
{88831}{88899}- The day after tomorrow?|- Will you be free?
{88901}{88959}Yeah, I'll probably be free.
{89492}{89589}One thing I find|very difficult to imagine...
{89591}{89678}is how one could have|this incredible background in music...
{89679}{89747}and then just walk away from it|without giving it a second thought.
{89749}{89783}I gave it a second thought.
{89878}{89952}How could you no longer play at all?|I think that's very strange.
{89954}{90011}I played a little bit|here and there.
{90013}{90108}As a matter of fact,|once I was a rehearsal pianist.
{90110}{90150}For ballet, an opera?
{90151}{90218}Las Vegas musical revue.
{90220}{90295}- You don't call that music.|- Oh, yes, I do.
{90297}{90343}It's music, you know.
{90505}{90551}Bring on the girls|I'm singing you a song
{90553}{90601}And off with the hey...
{91307}{91369}More gingerbread?
{91371}{91418}No, thank you.
{91485}{91531}Applesauce?
{93142}{93215}You know what I suggest, Ray.
{93217}{93265}Yeah, that's what I suggest...
{93267}{93345}because I don't know|how long it's gonna be.
{93417}{93463}I have to go now.
{93518}{93569}I have to get off now, Ray.
{93747}{93797}Yeah, well, uh...
{93798}{93870}I'II try and call you|in a couple of days.
{93872}{93949}If you're gone, you're gone.|Bye.
{94029}{94123}Robert, shh. My playing|put Father to sleep.
{94125}{94183}Would you help me|with this, please?
{94229}{94269}That's it.
{94411}{94484}You sure you should|be playing, Carl?
{94486}{94565}What do you mean?|I'm in superb shape, except for my neck.
{94566}{94621}There's something funny|about the way you move.
{94674}{94733}I'm not aware of...|What do you mean?
{94735}{94763}Two, eighteen.
{94835}{94925}I'd hate to see you walk|across a concert stage like that.
{94980}{95005}Two, nineteen.
{95065}{95155}I'd get somebody to coach you|on how to walk, if I was you, Carl.
{95157}{95209}I think|it's a substantial problem.
{95257}{95304}Damn it.
{95331}{95379}Look at that.
{95381}{95450}- Why are you being so mean?|- Mean? I'm not being mean.
{95452}{95524}He does walk funny.|Don't you see that?
{95526}{95573}He's walking around...
{95610}{95678}I don't think I'd notice.|I'm so used to Carl.
{95680}{95742}Yeah, well...
{95744}{95829}Do you think Spicer is attractive?
{95916}{95973}I think he's got|a terrific personality.
{95974}{96036}Spicer was formerly a sailor.
{96038}{96113}Look. Don't you see that?|Look at that. The guy's...
{96153}{96206}Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
{96208}{96302}You see? There's nothing wrong with|my walk, hmm? Where were we?
{96304}{96356}At game, Carl.
{96560}{96623}Well, that's three games|to "Z," Carl.
{96655}{96693}How about a rematch?
{96695}{96789}I thought you were going to the mainland|today. You'II miss the ferry.
{96790}{96849}Just when I was hitting my stride.
{96851}{96909}Say good-bye to Catherine|for me, will you?
{96970}{97013}Can I play now?
{97015}{97088}Tell her I'll be back|sometime tomorrow, will you?
{97123}{97169}Where is she, anyway?
{97171}{97243}Who?|Shopping in the village.
{97245}{97291}My turn.
{97293}{97343}Why don't you and Spicer play?
{97853}{97899}Hi.
{97901}{97947}Hello.
{97989}{98036}What's the matter?
{98038}{98076}Nothing.
{98233}{98272}Would you do something for me?
{98324}{98360}Would you play for me?
{98379}{98429}Catherine, your game.
{98715}{98761}Will you?
{102408}{102459}That was beautiful.|I'm surprised.
{102486}{102513}Thank you.
{102515}{102567}I was really very moved by...
{102633}{102721}- What's wrong?|- Nothing. It's just...
{102723}{102801}I picked the easiest piece|that I could think of.
{102803}{102895}I first played it when I was eight,|and I played it better then.
{102896}{102989}Can't you understand it was the feeling|I was affected by?
{102991}{103019}I didn't have any.
{103020}{103094}- You had no inner feeling?|- None.
{103134}{103194}Well, then, I must have been|supplying it.
{103196}{103294}Maybe if you'd supply more, it might|rub off on me. Who knows?
{103321}{103373}I doubt it.
{103375}{103418}I could get interested.
{103420}{103466}Well, I couldn't.
{103848}{103929}What does it have to be with you?|Grim and serious?
{103960}{104027}Look, you played.
{104028}{104103}I honestly responded...
{104104}{104183}and you made me feel embarrassed|for having responded to you.
{104260}{104287}It wasn't necessary.
{104288}{104319}Yeah, it was.
{104320}{104386}I faked a little Chopin.|You faked a big response.
{104388}{104434}I don't think that's accurate.
{104436}{104486}Up till now,|All I've been getting from you...
{104488}{104537}is meaningful looks|at the dinner table...
{104539}{104608}and a lot of vague suggestions|about the day after tomorrow.
{104609}{104680}I am not conscious of having given you|any particular looks.
{104681}{104767}And as for the day after tomorrow,|this is the day after tomorrow...
{104768}{104839}and I am, unfortunately,|seeing you.
{104840}{104907}Now, if you'll excuse me,|I'd like to take a bath.
{104908}{104965}- What do you want?|- I need some bath oil.
{104967}{105041}Bath oil? How about some avocado|or some of this?
{105043}{105129}- Or some jasmine? How about this?|- What are you doing?
{105131}{105201}What are you doing,|screwing around with all this crap?
{105271}{105353}I do not find your language|very charming.
{105355}{105414}It isn't. It's direct.
{105416}{105511}I'd like you to leave|so that I can take a bath.
{105513}{105559}Is that direct?
{105718}{105769}Serious...
{105771}{105860}- Is that what's important to you?|- Yes, that's what's important to me.
{105862}{105913}- Let's be serious.|- Don't do that.
{105915}{105947}Shut up.
{105948}{106013}No inner feeling?
{106696}{106743}I told him the truth finally.
{106779}{106862}He was my husband,|and I loved him very much.
{106863}{106936}But my God, it wasn't working|any better the second time...
{106938}{106988}than it did the first.
{106990}{107047}He was a cellist...
{107048}{107129}and there was I,|no longer 17...
{107131}{107214}Iooking up at him,|and I said to him...
{107216}{107277}"Joseph, you're full of beans."
{107279}{107313}And I left him.
{107315}{107390}- Is that what you said to him?|- Something like that.
{107428}{107550}As a matter of fact, Joseph|introduced me to Carl right around then.
{107552}{107589}How are you?
{107611}{107652}I'm incredible.
{107727}{107810}Carl restored me.|He really did.
{107812}{107907}He's much more substantial|than you give him credit for being.
{107956}{108040}Do you think you could|discreetly move across the hall now?
{108062}{108169}Yes, I think I could|discreetly move across the hall now.
{108516}{108644}I have some free time tomorrow morning|before Carl gets back, if you'd like.
{108646}{108692}Of course I'd like it.
{108864}{108911}Bananas, bananas.
{109338}{109442}You certainly do have a beautiful piece|of real estate out here, Mr. Dupea.
{109507}{109545}Can he hear me?
{109547}{109598}He's not hard of hearing.
{109599}{109648}Oh, that's a blessing at least.
{109684}{109805}This certainly is an improvement|on the motel and coffee shop.
{109807}{109873}How could you ever have left|such a beautiful place, Bobby?
{109875}{109936}I don't know.
{109956}{110015}You mean you've been staying|in a motel all this time?
{110017}{110110}For two whole weeks, and there was|hardly nobody to talk to but me.
{110112}{110220}But I don't understand? Why did you stay|there? There's plenty of room here.
{110222}{110268}I was going to, but...
{110270}{110350}Bobby had to come up here, he said,|and feel it up here first.
{110352}{110402}But then it took so long...
{110404}{110451}I run flat out of money.
{110452}{110512}You didn't leave me any number|or anything, honey.
{110545}{110607}And I had to, you know,|get in a taxi...
{110609}{110655}and come on out here...
{110657}{110718}in the hopes that I would not be|intrudin' myself.
{110720}{110834}No, not at all. You're perfectly|welcome to stay here.
{110835}{110882}Well, thank you.
{110912}{110974}That's a very nice thing|for you to say.
{110976}{111021}Not at all.
{111080}{111133}You certainly do have|a beautiful head of hair.
{111134}{111181}Thank you.
{111206}{111265}Is it natural?
{111266}{111314}What?
{111315}{111362}Just finish eating.
{111363}{111409}Am I holdin' up dessert?
{111410}{111478}No, not at all.|Take all the time you want.
{111480}{111552}I do eat slow as a bird...
{111554}{111630}whereas Bobby can pack it away|like a speed swing.
{111695}{111764}- Is there any ketchup around?|- For God's sake.
{111766}{111810}Robert, please,|let's not be rude.
{111836}{111917}It's okay. He didn't|mean anything by that.
{111918}{111965}I don't, huh?
{112070}{112125}Bobby's just about...
{112126}{112193}the moodiest man|I've ever been with.
{114585}{114647}- Are you all right?|- Where are you going?
{114649}{114708}To pick up some friends|of Carl's and mine.
{114710}{114770}- I wanna talk to you.|- I'll be back later.
{114772}{114824}I want to talk to you right now.|I want to explain.
{114826}{114908}- No, it isn't necessary.|- Yes, it is.
{114910}{114953}Come on, get moving!
{114954}{115058}- Will you shut up!|- Robert, I have to go.
{115060}{115106}Will you just wait one minute?
{115156}{115217}I haven't been fair to Carl.
{115219}{115270}I have to tell you that.
{115313}{115358}What? I can't hear you.
{115400}{115479}I'm sorry everything's|been so confusing.
{115481}{115547}I'll see you later|this evening.
{115696}{115758}But you see, man is born|into the world...
{115760}{115814}with his existent adversary|from the first.
{115816}{115881}It is his historic,|mythic inheritance.
{115883}{115925}So, is this startling?
{115927}{116007}Aggression is prehistoric. An organism|behaves according to its nature...
{116009}{116092}and its nature derives from|the circumstances of its inheritance.
{116094}{116193}The fact remains that primitive man took|delight in tearing his adversary apart.
{116194}{116286}And there is where, I think,|the core of the problem resides.
{116288}{116336}Doesn't that seem|unnecessarily apocalyptic?
{116338}{116397}I do not make poetry.
{116399}{116451}Is there a TV in the house?
{116516}{116550}I remarked to John...
{116552}{116645}that rationality is not a device|to alter facts.
{116646}{116726}But moreover, I think of it|as an extraneous tool, a gadget...
{116728}{116799}somewhat like the television.
{116801}{116870}To look at it any other way|is ridiculous.
{116872}{116922}There's some good things|on it, though.
{116954}{117001}- I beg your pardon.|- The TV.
{117002}{117051}There's some good things on it|sometimes.
{117053}{117160}I have strong doubts. Nevertheless,|I am not discussing media.
{117162}{117223}And there is always hope|for the few.
{117225}{117281}- What about love?|- What about it?
{117283}{117368}Wouldn't you say that more ill|has been done in the name of love...
{117369}{117406}than in the name of abomination?
{117408}{117459}No, I wouldn't.
{117461}{117551}Well, you are a romantic,|Catherine...
{117553}{117603}and once more,|about to be married.
{117605}{117709}So you can be excused from|objective discussions. But ask Carl.
{117711}{117811}Ask him if even the institution|of marriage is completely free from it.
{117813}{117848}Ask him.
{117850}{117957}I think these cold, objective|discussions are aggressive.
{117978}{118029}- Excuse me.|- That's reactive.
{118058}{118126}But if I may say without dampening|the spirit of your adventure...
{118128}{118185}You haven't dampened|my spirit, Samia.
{118186}{118229}- Excuse me.|- Well, I should hope not.
{118231}{118339}- But it's still open to discussion.|- I'm sorry.
{118389}{118448}I'm sorry,|I don't speak French.
{118450}{118503}And loftier natures...
{118505}{118586}- What kind of dog is this?|- This is a border collie.
{118588}{118646}I had a baby kitty cat once.
{118648}{118734}It was a fluffy thing.|Bobby gave it to me. Remember, Bobby?
{118774}{118867}- The little pussy cat you gave me?|- Yeah.
{118869}{118938}It had two little white front paws...
{118940}{119012}and I was crazy after her.
{119013}{119065}We left her at some friends' house...
{119067}{119155}and she got squashed flatter than|a tortilla outside their mobile home.
{119157}{119224}There. Do you see|what I mean?
{119225}{119332}The choice of words juxtaposed|with the image of a fluffy kitten.
{119333}{119438}The enchantment of words|"squashed," "flat," et cetera.
{119440}{119488}- Et cetera.|- Well, she was.
{119490}{119565}Perhaps, but it was just|what I was trying to point out.
{119567}{119608}Don't point at her.
{119609}{119650}I beg your pardon.
{119652}{119738}- I said, don't point at her, you creep.|- But I was just...
{119740}{119805}Where do you get the ass|to tell anybody anything about class...
{119807}{119866}or who's got it|or what she typifies?
{119868}{119925}You shouldn't be in the same room|with her, you pompous celibate.
{119926}{119996}- This is too much.|- Just calm down.
{119997}{120057}You're totally full of shit.
{120058}{120108}You're all full of shit.
{120726}{120794}I can't talk to you.|Leave me alone.
{120880}{120950}- What the hell's going on?|- What are you doing?
{121004}{121058}Get out of my room.|This is my room.
{121115}{121241}I'm talking to you, Tita! I told you|to take your hands off her, nurse!
{121243}{121278}- Move out!|- Stop it!
{121380}{121454}Will ya... Hold it!|Take it easy.
{121488}{121568}- Take it easy, will ya?|- Please, stop!
{121748}{121838}- Will you give up? Give up, will ya?|- Stop it!
{121840}{121898}Give up!
{122296}{122359}I just wanted to talk to you.
{122468}{122526}It's useless.
{122552}{122608}Look, give me a chance.
{122609}{122670}I'm trying to be delicate|with you...
{122672}{122742}but you just won't understand.
{122744}{122802}I couldn't go with you.
{122804}{122856}Not because of Carl and my music,|but because of you.
{122968}{123026}You're a strange person, Robert.
{123078}{123124}What will you come to?
{123160}{123266}If a person has no love for himself,|no respect for himself...
{123268}{123379}no love of his friends,|family, work, something...
{123380}{123448}how can he ask for love in return?
{123450}{123488}Why should he ask for it?
{123566}{123667}Living here in this rest home, asylum...|that's what you want?
{123669}{123704}Yes.
{123705}{123764}That will make you happy?
{123789}{123836}I hope it will. Yes.
{123957}{124004}I'm sorry.
{124741}{124788}Okay.
{125248}{125294}Are you cold?
{125758}{125812}I don't know if you'd be...
{125814}{125917}particularly interested|in hearing anything about me...
{125919}{125965}my life.
{125967}{126061}Most of it doesn't add up|to much that I could relay...
{126063}{126121}as a way of life|that you'd approve of.
{126163}{126209}I move around a lot.
{126252}{126344}Not because I'm looking|for anything really, but...
{126382}{126486}'cause I'm getting away|from things that get bad...
{126488}{126534}if I stay.
{126592}{126652}Auspicious beginnings.|You know what I mean?
{127026}{127090}I'm trying to imagine your...
{127092}{127162}your half of this conversation.
{127229}{127310}My feeling is,|I don't know...
{127311}{127416}that if you could talk,|we wouldn't be talking.
{127471}{127576}It's pretty much the way|that it got to be before I left.
{127657}{127683}Are you all right?
{127781}{127827}I don't know what to say.
{127994}{128082}Tita suggested that we try to...|I don't know.
{128084}{128146}I think that she feels...
{128147}{128272}I think that she feels that we've got|some understanding to reach.
{128367}{128444}She totally denies the fact|that we were never that comfortable...
{128446}{128512}with one another to begin with.
{128808}{128880}The best|that I can do is apologize.
{128972}{129070}We both know that I was never|that good at it anyway.
{129278}{129348}I'm sorry it didn't work out.
{129568}{129642}- You're leaving.|- Yeah.
{129643}{129710}I said a week.|I think I overstayed myself.
{129711}{129781}You were going without|saying good-bye to me.
{129783}{129842}I didn't want to say good-bye|to anyone.
{129867}{129914}What about me?
{129939}{130005}I'll say good-bye to you, Tita.
{130115}{130150}Watch the birdie!
{130259}{130306}- Bye.|- Bye.
{130350}{130392}- Come on.|- Wait a sec.
{130394}{130480}I want Tita to take a picture|of you and me in front of the place.
{130528}{130609}I never got to thank you all|for your hospitality.
{130611}{130736}Tell Carl, if any of you want to come|to our place, you're more than welcome.
{130771}{130817}Bye, now.
{131267}{131396}Your kiss is like a drink
{131398}{131512}When I am thirsty
{131514}{131614}Oh, and I'm thirsty
{131616}{131662}For you
{131664}{131732}With all my heart
{131791}{131887}But don 't love me|then pretend
{131889}{131992}As though|we've never even kissed
{132023}{132088}Don't touch me
