{9779}{9852}Yeah, it was a long night.
{9870}{9923}We had a meeting.
{9940}{9986}A meeting? What about?
{9996}{10027}l forgot.
{10100}{10200}We're really in a hurry.|- Mattes, you sure are a pest.
{10210}{10283}First you almost stone me,|and then you rush me.
{10308}{10425}Can't you just ring the bell?|Your predecessor Mischa was good.
{10435}{10568}He'd be waiting with two ice-cold beers|after every game.
{10620}{10680}Hey, Kottel!|You're not offended, are you?
{10690}{10746}No, but ...
{10764}{10859}lf l'm not good enough,|you might find another bag boy.
{10884}{10964}Nonsense, Mattes!|You're my mascot.
{10995}{11074}l only win when you're there.|You saw what happened in Aachen.
{11084}{11149}You don't think so? lt's true!
{11159}{11240}l always win those close games|when you're there.
{11295}{11328}Come on.
{11375}{11468}Hurry,|or l get charged for coming late.
{11511}{11539}That's what l said.
{12283}{12311}Man oh man!
{12321}{12430}Look at Boss crawl across the field.|- Old men can't run, Willi.
{12475}{12544}No wonder they lose in Aachen.
{12616}{12739}Man!|- My grandma could've done that, too.
{12842}{12953}Helmut, you couldn't even|hit a truck from 3 meters!
{13043}{13100}l heard that, Willi!
{13535}{13599}Where've you been?|- What's wrong?
{13695}{13753}She didn't want to open it|until everybody was here.
{13936}{13985}What if he's dead?
{14581}{14642}We're gonna be a real family again.
{14750}{14788}Hey ...
{14813}{14841}Aren't you happy?
{14879}{14900}Sure.
{15011}{15046}Munich
{15270}{15356}Wewetzer through the middle,|passes to Paetz who passes to Kruhl,
{15366}{15421}Kruhl shoots ... lt's a goal!
{15431}{15516}Kruhl scores in the 81st minute.
{15526}{15585}That was the decisive goal|in Hamburg Stadium.
{15595}{15646}Stay seated.|- 4-1. - Not bad.
{15656}{15697}For Hanover.|- What?
{15707}{15757}Honest. - Hanover's leading|Kaiserslautern four to one?
{15767}{15815}Yeah.|- Unbelievable! - lt's true.
{15825}{15942}A remarkable final game for the German|championship. The crowd is mocking
{15952}{15986}Coach Herberger.
{15996}{16057}Kaiserslautern,|the team that's losing here,
{16067}{16166}is the backbone of the German team.
{16176}{16278}What a dark hour|for the German team coach.
{16288}{16379}A dark hour too for Annette|Ackermann, maiden name von Hadding.
{16389}{16428}Annette!|- Hello, gentlemen!
{16458}{16540}Off work already?|- No, of course not. Sorry.
{16571}{16596}Sorry.
{16626}{16711}Hey, what's wrong with soccer?|l mean, l'm a sports reporter.
{16721}{16783}You have your good sides, too.
{16793}{16892}Come to a game with me sometime ...|- Just what l needed.
{16910}{16986}Hey, l've been looking|for this everywhere.
{17080}{17132}What is it?|- Morocco.
{17156}{17275}Oad gave us the house and a wedding|trip. Perhaps you'd like to join me.
{17285}{17384}lf you can find time between|soccer matches. - A honeymoon?
{17394}{17513}You proposed, l accepted,|and we got married. - Right.
{17523}{17633}We could go to Egypt afterwards, too,|to see the pyramids.
{17643}{17755}lt sounds more like a crusade.|- l knew you'd love the idea.
{18600}{18693}What if he doesn't show up again?|- Stop it. l'm nervous enough.
{18732}{18806}l just hope he's okay. Who knows|what the Russians did to him.
{18816}{18909}The Russians! The Russians!|The Russians kicked the Germans' ass,
{18919}{18981}'cause the Germans|attacked them for no reason.
{19901}{19926}Christa!
{20070}{20139}l'm ... l'm lngrid.
{20697}{20723}And who's he?
{21125}{21171}l wrote you about him.
{21210}{21256}l never got a letter.
{21300}{21336}l'm sorry ...
{21420}{21492}Matthias arrived after you were|sent back to the front.
{21575}{21691}9 months after you were sent back.|- You'll speak when you're asked to.
{21815}{21871}You named him after my father?
{21976}{22035}Well ... this is it.
{22058}{22131}We're closed today,|in your honor.
{22162}{22236}lt's just a 5-minute bike ride|to the coal mine.
{22307}{22407}You work behind the counter?|- Yes, and lngrid is a waitress.
{22477}{22548}What about Bruno?|- Not me. l'm a musician.
{22558}{22610}A musician, huh?|- Yeah.
{22772}{22817}And who's this?|- The Boss.
{22827}{22878}So they call him.|Actually, his name's
{22888}{22932}Helmut Rahn.|- He plays for Rot-Weiss Essen,
{22942}{23018}and he's on the national team.|And he's my best friend.
{23028}{23101}The World Cup's in Switzerland ...|- Your best friend!
{23123}{23217}l carry his bag|and get to see the games for free.
{23227}{23302}He's sort of his father figure.
{23957}{24081}The kids are completely ...|lt's time they got some discipline.
{24091}{24200}l had so little time for them,|with the bar and all ...
{24227}{24301}Things will change|when l get my compensation.
{24332}{24457}l'll work in Shaft No. 4 again,|so l can feed my family myself.
{24642}{24708}Then we can sell the bar.
{25474}{25538}Just give me some time, Christa.
{25828}{25910}Morning, Ackermann. - Morning,|Mr. Ahrens. - Congratulations.
{25920}{26007}Thanks. - ls your wife expecting?|- No, but we're working on it.
{26017}{26131}Good. But be careful.|Women are the natural enemy of soccer.
{26141}{26214}Eventually the nagging subsides.|- Whatever you say.
{26224}{26316}Listen, Ackermann, l have a problem.|- Yes?
{26336}{26396}l need a good man|to go to Switzerland.
{26408}{26466}What? To the World Cup?|- Exactly.
{26476}{26524}l thought|Schwerdtfeger was doing that.
{26534}{26660}l took him off it. Herberger was|so annoyed by his last commentary.
{26670}{26767}l need somebody with a clean slate|down there, a guy with talent!
{26815}{26880}You mean ... me?
{26898}{26942}A guy who grasps things at once.
{27283}{27351}Nothing ...|as far as the eye can see.
{27564}{27632}Honey, help me choose a dress.
{27642}{27694}Annette, l got to tell you something.|- Huh?
{27704}{27772}We have to cancel our honeymoon.
{27828}{27898}Ahrens is sending me|to the World Cup.
{27935}{27961}No!
{27991}{28059}The chance of a lifetime.|l can't say no.
{28123}{28267}Are you trying to tell me that soccer|is more important than our honeymoon?
{28300}{28365}24 guys running after a single ball?
{28375}{28400}22.
{28453}{28502}Fine, 22, for all l care.
{28512}{28581}lt'd be boring|if everyone had a ball.
{28829}{28854}Okay, Ackermann!
{28898}{28966}What d'you mean by ''okay''?|- You can go.
{29006}{29078}l can?|- Under one condition.
{29101}{29126}Which is?
{29165}{29198}l'm going with you.
{29224}{29314}Oon't be sad, Kottel.|l'll be back soon. - Can't l go, too?
{29324}{29398}How? You wanna sleep under my bed?|- Why not?
{29408}{29496}'cause l share with Fritz Walter,|and he can't sleep when you snore.
{29506}{29569}And if he can't sleep,|he won't play well,
{29579}{29701}and we'll lose and be eliminated.|You want that? - No. - You see.
{29782}{29865}But you said you couldn't win|the big games without me.
{29875}{29999}You're right. But it won't work.|What would your father say?
{30009}{30051}l wish you were my father.
{30104}{30183}Oon't ever say that, Mattes.|Your father went through a lot.
{30193}{30269}And he needs you here.|Things will get better soon.
{30279}{30336}Yeah.|- Okay.
{30346}{30435}Now read it again,|but slowly, so l can enjoy it.
{30522}{30602}''Oear sports fans,|We are glad to inform you
{30612}{30676}that we are expecting you|on Wednesday,
{30686}{30768}May 26, 1954
{30778}{30838}at the Sports Academy|in Munich-Grunwald.
{30865}{30963}We wish to point out that all players|receive compensation for missing work
{30973}{31091}while the team is participating in|the competition. Regards, Passler.''
{31101}{31145}They better have enough cash.
{31213}{31242}Time to go.
{31274}{31299}Come on!
{31586}{31617}Good luck, Boss!
{31627}{31673}You too, fart face!
{31702}{31744}Careful!
{32068}{32170}Please welcome|our national goalkeeper, Anton Turek.
{32180}{32249}Of course we all call him Toni.|He brought something
{32259}{32376}for our campaign in support|of soldiers returning from Russia.
{32409}{32434}Yes,
{32444}{32519}l have an original|World Cup soccer ball ...
{32529}{32610}signed by all the players|from Fortuna Ousseldorf.
{32620}{32705}We hope you raise lots of money|for the returning soldiers,
{32715}{32822}and wish good luck|to all the participants.
{32838}{32918}l would be happy if,|with your support,
{32936}{33011}some of the returning soldiers were able
{33021}{33071}to live normal lives again.
{33095}{33135}Yes.|- Thank you.
{33145}{33170}Yes.
{33229}{33292}This darned thing!|Reception's lousy!
{33302}{33360}Take the expensive thing back|while you still can.
{33370}{33451}lf you want to compete with Kessler,|then you'd better keep it.
{33466}{33513}You know how men|are crazy about soccer.
{33523}{33556}Like your nutty son.
{33566}{33631}He actually believes|Rahn can't win without him.
{33641}{33688}The big games. He said so himself.
{33776}{33884}... for the final training|before the World Cup in Switzerland.
{33894}{33961}Leading the attack|and the first to leave the bus,
{33971}{34083}Max Morlock from Nuremberg,|followed by Helmut Rahn from Essen
{34093}{34143}and Berni Klodt from Schalke 04.
{34153}{34279}Toni Turek from Ousseldorf|flanked by Pirmasens' Heinz Kubsch
{34289}{34356}and Heinrich Kwiatkowski|from Oortmund.
{34366}{34466}Assistant Coach Albert Sing|has Otmar Walter from Kaiserslautern
{34476}{34566}and Herbert Erhardt|from Furth run the course.
{34576}{34643}These two will go to bed|with a headache.
{34660}{34784}Karl-Heinz Metzner from Hessen-Kassel|and Uli Biesinger from BC Augsburg.
{34799}{34944}Rivals at home, here they work|together to crush their opponents.
{34954}{35078}Alfred Pfaff from Eintracht Frankfurt|and Richard Herrmann, FSV Frankfurt.
{35088}{35178}This will certainly command|our opponents' respect.
{35188}{35278}Paul Mebus from Cologne|demonstrates his footwork,
{35294}{35373}while his teammate Hans Schafer|is no less nimble.
{35383}{35457}Recovering from practice|with a friendly card game
{35467}{35567}are Werner Liebrich, Horst Eckel and|Werner Kohlmeyer from Kaiserslautern.
{35577}{35644}The Bavarians are more relaxed.
{35654}{35741}Karl Mai from Furth|and Hans Bauer from Bavaria Munich.
{35751}{35823}Fritz Laband and Jupp Posipal|from Hamburg
{35833}{35947}carry out the most pleasant exercise:|signing autographs.
{35957}{36010}But isn't someone missing?|Of course,
{36020}{36142}the captain. And there he is.|Fritz Walter from Kaiserslautern.
{36152}{36231}Bravo, Fritz Walter.|Smile, please.
{36241}{36294}And here's the whole team.
{36304}{36406}Good luck, guys.|Your country's rooting for you.
{36565}{36596}Welcome home, Richard.
{36618}{36731}Thanks. - Nice to have you back.|- Things have changed down here.
{37095}{37160}Good luck.|- Good luck.
{38861}{38914}Sports Academy Grunwald
{39246}{39285}Men, it starts in two weeks.
{39295}{39366}We're playing in Switzerland,|and we want to look good.
{39376}{39467}But l'm afraid l see major problems|in your physical fitness.
{39477}{39601}So we'll be doing more gymnastics.|We'll start with pushups.
{40260}{40354}You gotta work hard.|Make these training sessions pay off.
{40364}{40471}Work on your weaknesses,|but also train what you do well.
{40481}{40580}What's the saying? Looks and fitness|are gone before the break of dawn.
{40594}{40680}You've already lost your looks,|so try to stay fit.
{40749}{40834}By the way, Metzner,|you're a terrific soccer player.
{40844}{40883}But you smoke on the sly.
{40893}{40975}You're cheating your teammates.|You could play a lot better.
{40985}{41054}So l want you to pack your bags|and head home.
{41291}{41353}Wasn't that a bit strict?|- Sure. He can stay.
{41363}{41482}But the guys gotta realize|that l mean business. Let's see, Adi.
{41680}{41777}lt's lighter than the previous one.|- Right, but that's not what l mean.
{41787}{41839}Oon't keep me in suspense.
{42046}{42082}They're screwed on.|- Exactly.
{42098}{42134}Screw-on cleats.
{42150}{42185}Screwed on.
{42216}{42250}Brilliant!
{42318}{42359}For every type of weather
{42384}{42423}the proper length.
{42453}{42554}Yeah, they fit perfectly.|Of course, they're screwed on.
{42588}{42610}Well?
{42633}{42745}What do you think,|l want two sets for the championship.
{44374}{44475}Listen, lngrid, you are not to have|any contact with soldiers.
{44485}{44580}But l didn't do anything ...|- And don't get all dolled up!
{44590}{44644}That's not true.|l just wanted to ...
{44654}{44725}As long as you live in my house|there are certain rules
{44736}{44784}that you have to obey.|ls that clear?
{44982}{45009}Tip.|- Top.
{45019}{45084}Tip.|- Top. - Tip ...
{45097}{45212}Okay, l'll take Lang.|- Akki and Nolden are on my team.
{45251}{45332}We'll take Mischa and Buri.
{45355}{45435}l'll take Rainer and Carola.
{45471}{45557}And you get Lubanski.|- No, we get Carola, you get Mattes.
{45567}{45643}Okay, but next time you get him.
{46483}{46533}Hey, you're on our team, man!
{46857}{46882}Shoot!
{46926}{46956}Goal!
{47673}{47743}A sentence with x.|- l'm in a fix.
{47822}{47902}Mom said you used to play soccer.|- Nope.
{48013}{48077}They only let me play|when we're an odd number.
{48106}{48140}That girl wasn't bad.
{48150}{48282}Carola's good. l can't get past her.|Not even when l use Boss's tricks.
{48292}{48327}'cause you're doing what you can't.
{48374}{48460}You copy his style,|but it isn't your own.
{48476}{48544}So what is my style?|- You're tough and fast.
{48554}{48618}You run more than the others.|You're a defensive player.
{48693}{48815}lf you want the others' respect,|don't do a bad job of copying a star.
{48848}{48889}Werner Liebrich,
{48899}{49034}Werner Liebrich, are you sleeping?|Are you sleeping?
{49044}{49128}Morning bells are ringing.|Morning bells are ringing ...
{49138}{49227}Are you sleeping?|Are you sleeping?
{49450}{49485}Training Camp Spiez
{49495}{49548}What a lovely breeze.|You ought to bottle it.
{49558}{49640}Just right for when|you run out of breath.
{49650}{49778}Hey, look out! - Look at the boaties!|We can paddle around the lake!
{49788}{49910}Those are pedalos, not boaties.|You only get boaties in Kaiserslautern.
{49943}{50022}Heard the news, Berni?|The Urus share our practice field.
{50032}{50109}lncredible! We're together|with the defending champs.
{50119}{50218}l don't know about you guys,|but l'm getting nervous.
{50392}{50502}Hey, Helmut. Your wife folded it all|so nicely, and you just stuff it in.
{50512}{50624}How d'you know what's clean or dirty?|- l smell it. How do you do it?
{50700}{50777}Hey, the Swiss aren't only good|at making clocks.
{50787}{50890}l keep wondering why coach punished me|by putting me in a room with you.
{50900}{51002}You think he'll put me in|against the Turks? l'm in great shape.
{51012}{51109}Are you starting that again?|Okay, yes, he's putting you in.
{51135}{51202}But Berni Klodt's in great shape too.|Maybe he'll pick him.
{51212}{51283}You're right. He'll pick Berni.
{51302}{51384}Come on, Friedrich. You're kidding.|- Know what?
{51409}{51453}l'm gonna take a shower.
{51568}{51605}Strange guy.
{52480}{52561}Let me guess. You don't like it.|- Well, l always imagined ...
{52576}{52665}soccer reporters|living in ... squalor.
{52675}{52744}Well, this suite|was booked for Schwerdtfeger.
{52754}{52823}l'm sure they would've|put me up under a bridge.
{52843}{52949}Now, isn't the opening game|between Yugoslavia and France?
{52959}{53010}Right.|- Who are we for?
{53020}{53083}For nobody. We're reporters.|We have to remain neutral.
{53108}{53164}And when Germany plays Turkey?
{53174}{53263}We're for Germany, of course.|- We aren't reporters then?
{53273}{53297}Yes, we are.
{53333}{53433}lsn't that a bit irrational?
{53453}{53527}Maybe.|- Like me sometimes?
{53600}{53666}Hail Mary, full of grace,|the Lord is with you.
{53676}{53729}Blessed are you among women,
{53739}{53849}and blessed is the fruit|of your womb, Jesus. Hail Mary ...
{55015}{55082}Opening Round Germany vs. Turkey
{55112}{55212}Gentlemen, this is it.|We're playing against Turkey.
{55222}{55342}The Turks eliminated Spain,|so we can't take it easy.
{55365}{55444}This is the lineup:|Toni, you're in goal.
{55454}{55533}On defense:|Laband, Posipal, Kohlmeyer.
{55543}{55591}Eckel and Mai in running position.
{55601}{55660}As halfbacks, Morlock and Fritz.
{55670}{55739}Left forward is Hans Schafer,|in the middle Otmar,
{55749}{55775}and right forward
{55799}{55836}is Berni Klodt.
{55864}{55932}We leave in two hours.|l expect you to be on time.
{56682}{56744}Goal! We won 4-1.
{56795}{56843}You played great, Matthias.
{57142}{57183}So, Mr. Lubanski ...
{57193}{57282}lt's right that the government is|compensating the returning soldiers.
{57292}{57398}But the number of years is wrong.|- No, l'd never get that wrong.
{57408}{57437}11 years and 4 months.
{57473}{57535}According to my documents,|you were found guilty of theft
{57545}{57609}and sabotage and sentenced|to an additional 5 years.
{57619}{57748}That means you weren't a POW|and are not entitled to compensation ...
{57758}{57859}We stole some brown sugar|from the kitchen, 'cause we were dying.
{57893}{57975}l don't doubt it, Mr. Lubanski,|but it doesn't change the facts.
{57985}{58073}You know how many starved to death?|Hundreds of thousands!
{58083}{58138}l saw hundreds of us die.
{58148}{58220}Sabotage! Theft!|That was just a joke.
{58230}{58332}Mr. Lubanski, l didn't make the rules.|You aren't the first to complain.
{58342}{58389}You should be happy that ...|- Happy?
{58410}{58451}l should be happy?
{58461}{58562}You know who can be happy? You!|That you weren't in Russia.
{58572}{58632}And that l don't|beat your face to a pulp.
{58879}{58914}Opening Round Germany vs. Hungary
{58924}{58985}The Hungarians also seem surprised|by the German team's lineup.
{58995}{59045}But they won't worry about it.
{59055}{59095}Fifty cents.
{59105}{59160}What? Admission?
{59230}{59280}This is daylight robbery!
{59495}{59581}Hey? Everything okay?|- Nothing's okay.
{59591}{59641}Herberger's letting the subs play.
{59813}{59855}Goal!
{59865}{59933}l knew it! l knew it!
{59943}{60052}Shit! - Why can't Kwiatkowski|hold the ball? - Matthias?
{60077}{60113}Come here.
{60320}{60355}Sit down.
{60430}{60503}Sell me one of your cigarettes?|- Sure.
{60643}{60716}Here, it's yours.|- Thanks.
{60920}{61008}l saw you at church recently.|You lit a candle.
{61035}{61066}For whom?
{61206}{61240}Come on, tell me.
{61258}{61282}For Helmut Rahn.
{61323}{61422}Helmut Rahn? - Herberger doesn't put|him in, so l thought l'd help.
{61547}{61581}Come outside with me.
{61895}{62013}You lit a candle at church to keep|some soccer player from being a sub?
{62023}{62088}But Rahn isn't just some player.|He's the best.
{62098}{62140}And l ...|- Will you be quiet?
{62150}{62230}Where'd you get the idea|of abusing the church?
{62261}{62310}Go home and think about|what church means.
{62320}{62383}But they're playing ...|- That's it! Go home!
{62393}{62476}And don't start crying!|German boys never cry!
{62799}{62870}What's wrong?|- None of your business.
{62880}{62949}Can't l even ask?|- Shut up and get inside!
{62959}{63015}l told you to get inside!
{63198}{63238}Oid you hear that?
{63263}{63317}''A German boy never cries.''
{63388}{63457}l wish he'd never come back!
{63555}{63613}Hurry up, Alfred. l'm hungry ...
{63623}{63650}Yeah.
{64209}{64238}8-3!
{64270}{64317}What a disgrace!
{64369}{64425}lt's all Herberger's fault!
{64450}{64500}What's the problem?
{64510}{64585}l think he's pretty clever.|- You think so, huh?
{64595}{64704}He's saving his best players|for the game against the Turks.
{64715}{64807}l'd have done that, too.|- Well, Sepp'd be happy to know that.
{64911}{64963}Another cold drink?
{65575}{65600}What's wrong?
{65610}{65659}3 beers, and get the next 3 ready.
{65669}{65776}Oon't look. Those are players|from the German team.
{65821}{65898}So what?|They're having a drink like us.
{65925}{66052}How naive can you be? You think|Herberger'd let them get drunk now?
{66062}{66140}Ah! You think they jumped the coop?
{66150}{66175}Yeah.
{66263}{66339}Let's dance a little closer|to hear what they're saying.
{66349}{66399}8 goals, huh?
{66409}{66525}How's it feel to be a stopgap?|- We're fine for the dirty work.
{66535}{66660}But they'll probably do|the next game without us.
{66670}{66750}You guys are lucky.|At least each of you scored a goal.
{66760}{66865}All l got is bruises.|l still have trouble running.
{66875}{66950}Who cares! Let's wash down|our anger the right way!
{66960}{67062}At least it'll be worth it|if the old man catches us! - Cheers!
{69282}{69370}... we are not going home.
{69380}{69463}My God he's heavy.|- lt's his muscles.
{69486}{69587}What?|- Look at those thighs!
{69597}{69662}Every muscle is perfectly trained.
{69672}{69726}Yeah, whatever.
{69832}{69897}Who are you, buddy?|- Ackermann, Suddeutsche News.
{69910}{69961}Great sports section.|- Thanks.
{70023}{70057}And you, milady?
{70067}{70128}His wife.|- What a shame.
{70155}{70253}Let's leave him here, honey, and go.|We'll call the doorkeeper.
{70263}{70307}We don't want to get involved.
{70381}{70449}lncredible thighs!|- An incredible story!
{70459}{70541}Oon't you dare! Or l'll get a divorce.|- Then l won't.
{70890}{70915}Stop!
{70985}{71020}Howdy, Mr. Herberger.
{71031}{71054}Howdy.
{71072}{71147}l didn't want to startle you,|but l already mopped the floor.
{71157}{71256}l'd be grateful, if you didn't|walk over it. - At this hour?
{71266}{71310}Yeah, it's the only time.
{71320}{71383}Can l sit down and wait|until the floor is dry?
{71393}{71433}Sure thing.
{71634}{71689}Oid you lose today?
{71720}{71744}You bet!
{71814}{71886}So you've been eliminated?
{71915}{71992}No, we lost a battle|but not the war.
{72054}{72101}Young lady, do you have any children?
{72127}{72158}Who, me?
{72181}{72237}Nine of 'em. And you?
{72250}{72356}22, and one of them|is causing me lots of trouble.
{72366}{72487}l bet he's your favorite.|They always cause the most trouble.
{72506}{72602}That's why it's hard to punish 'em.|- Nonsense.
{72612}{72689}What?|- Nonsense! Hogwash! Rubbish!
{72699}{72806}You aren't in Germany now.|You don't always have to punish 'em.
{72849}{72908}But if somebody isn't for me,|they're against me.
{72918}{72981}You gotta turn a blind eye sometimes.
{72991}{73038}No pain, no gain.
{73063}{73117}When an apple is ripe
{73135}{73206}it falls from the tree.
{73251}{73292}The early bird catches the worm?
{73308}{73381}The ball is round,|and a game lasts
{73391}{73436}90 minutes.
{73899}{73966}Hey, are you crazy?
{73980}{74082}Maybe. Why? - The coach'll send you home|if he finds out.
{74139}{74232}Who cares!|One less benchwarmer in Switzerland.
{74248}{74322}We're a team.|We win together and lose together.
{74332}{74381}We need you|as much as everybody else.
{74391}{74461}Too late.|Oassler found me outside the hotel.
{74581}{74660}Helmut, tell me one thing.
{74686}{74729}Are you for us or against us?
{74744}{74846}What do you mean?|- lf you're for us, l'll talk to Adi.
{74856}{74949}But if it happens again, l'll put you|on the train and kick your ass.
{74971}{75069}Hey, Friedrich. l've never seen you|like this. Are you serious?
{75360}{75450}Of course l'm for you guys.|- Okay.
{75495}{75600}Be careful on track 1.|Train No. 224
{75610}{75680}from Oortmund to Basel,
{75690}{75792}via Ouisburg, Ousseldorf, Koln, Bonn,|Koblenz, Mainz, Mannheim, Karlsruhe.
{75802}{75831}Come on!
{75876}{75942}l've been looking for you everywhere!
{76121}{76196}None of that Switzerland stuff!|You're grounded for a week!
{76265}{76295}Orop your pants!|- What?
{76305}{76351}l told you to drop your pants.
{76675}{76700}Bend over!
{76971}{77025}Stop it, Richard! At once!
{77035}{77093}Leave me alone!|- You're beating him raw!
{77103}{77185}Are you against me, too? - What?|- Are you against me?
{77195}{77336}Oon't you care what the kids|and l feel? - Are you blaming me?
{77346}{77451}Look what you've done! Our oldest son|is a big mouth with Communist ideas,
{77461}{77535}our daughter a soldier's whore,|and the kid wants to run away!
{77545}{77588}Ask him why! lt's because of you!
{77610}{77697}l'm just trying to teach him|discipline to make him fit,
{77707}{77747}so he'll be somebody.|- l see!
{77802}{77899}What do you think l've been doing?|l fed the family.
{77909}{78002}l started the bar, took care of|the household and raised the kids.
{78012}{78104}Now you come and run everything down|and put things ''right'' again!
{78140}{78217}l didn't run everything down ...|- Let me tell you something.
{78227}{78336}Before you came, we were happy.|Since then, the kids feel upset,
{78346}{78377}sad and wretched.
{78387}{78442}You want me|to go back to prison camp?
{78452}{78581}Stop pitying yourself all the time.|Can't you ever think of anyone else?
{78591}{78717}Since you arrived, everybody's|constantly thinking of your feelings.
{78727}{78780}Have you ever shown any appreciation?
{78797}{78883}Bruno earns a few marks with his band,|lngrid helps out in the bar.
{78893}{78953}Even the kid helps out|by selling cigarettes.
{78963}{79018}That's discipline!|And one more thing ...
{79028}{79083}You're the least disciplined of us all!
{79471}{79502}Ladies and gentlemen.
{79512}{79560}Your questions, please. Mr. Holzmann.
{79583}{79655}The lineup in Basel,|the chaos on defense ...
{79665}{79738}ls that the way|to beat Hungary, Mr. Herberger?
{79760}{79812}ln two days we have a tough game ...
{79822}{79906}The Turks beat Korea.|So we have to play them again.
{79916}{79941}We gotta win!
{79958}{80003}Mr. Ruhpoldt, please.
{80028}{80056}8 goals ...
{80066}{80135}Lots of Germans, not only the experts,|have the feeling
{80145}{80258}that you've done tremendous damage|to German ''football'' by losing 3-8.
{80275}{80297}Well ...
{80307}{80362}The ''football'' we're playing with|is Swiss-made,
{80372}{80441}and the last time l looked|it was hard and round.
{80459}{80511}No signs of any damage!
{80600}{80650}The young colleague over there.
{80720}{80798}Mr Herberger!|The loss to Hungary was a shock.
{80808}{80923}Won't this tactic endanger team spirit|in the game against Turkey?
{80933}{81000}ls it still possible to coordinate|our team's attack and offense?
{81050}{81116}l mean the defense and defenders ...
{81309}{81345}What will happen in midfield?
{81376}{81421}What's going to happen?
{81470}{81516}Know what, young man?
{81526}{81585}The ball is round,|and a game lasts 90 minutes.
{81784}{81852}Germany vs. Turkey, the decisive match
{82312}{82386}Okay, men, here's the lineup.|Toni's the goalie,
{82396}{82476}Laband and Posipal are in defense,|Bauer, Eckel and Mai in midfield,
{82496}{82561}Morlock and Fritz are behind Schafer,|Ottmar and Berni Klodt.
{82622}{82731}Men, it's the decisive match against|Turkey. You know what that means.
{82760}{82830}But beforehand, let me read|some letters from our countrymen
{82840}{82923}back home, in reaction|to the game against Hungary.
{82933}{83012}''Mr. Herberger, if the coach|of the national team doesn't know
{83022}{83103}what to offer sports fans|in a situation like this,
{83113}{83209}then he should buy himself a noose|and hang himself from the next tree,
{83219}{83298}but do it in such a way|that the rope can be reused.''
{83308}{83392}''Herberger! You should be|put on trial for sabotage.
{83402}{83496}You should take|the appropriate measures
{83506}{83581}which decent people take|in a situation like this.
{83591}{83637}Resign.''
{83686}{83776}''Get rid of Herberger!|Fifty lashes on his bare feet
{83801}{83855}and kick him out of Germany!
{83865}{83921}That traitor is no longer|one of us!''
{83968}{84009}Now get out there!
{84335}{84381}7-2 for us
{85056}{85122}What's wrong, Coach?|We're one of 8 teams left.
{85132}{85231}l don't know who to start at right wing,|Berni or the Boss.
{85257}{85326}You're the captain, Fritz.|What do you think?
{85347}{85466}Klodt, Rahn, they're both good.|Both have their merits.
{85505}{85576}Berni's done an excellent job so far.
{85593}{85713}He plays well with Morlock. We can|rely on them to keep the ball moving.
{85723}{85808}But we can't play as offensively|against Yugoslavia as against Turkey.
{85818}{85881}We have to start from the defensive.
{85941}{86010}Maybe the Boss'd be the right man.
{86029}{86113}lf he doesn't pass the ball|or passes badly ...
{86123}{86222}l have the funny feeling|he'll be the deciding factor.
{86240}{86303}l don't think|the Boss'll disappoint you.
{86338}{86427}One more disappointment|would be too much. Get my meaning?
{86456}{86527}Look after him, will you?
{86585}{86644}Germany vs. Yugoslavia, Quarter-Final
{86687}{86737}Hello, sports fans!|- Hi.
{86747}{86837}How's our prisoner?|Sentenced to 5 years of grounding
{86847}{86957}for desertion|and sabotaging piggy banks.
{86967}{87003}Ha, ha.
{87022}{87124}Listen, if he hits you again|l'll hit him back, okay?
{87142}{87204}Secondly, we all know|imprisonment is a desperate situation
{87214}{87266}in which|special measures can be taken.
{87276}{87421}For example, if you can't listen to|the game at cute little Carola's,
{87431}{87502}it doesn't mean|you can't listen at all.
{87587}{87650}... the lineup.|Turek is goalie,
{87660}{87702}Laband and Kohlmeyer are on defense,
{87712}{87819}Eckel, Liebrich and Mai are|in midfield, Helmut Rahn is forward ...
{87829}{87864}Rahn's starting!
{87885}{87910}Oinner!
{87944}{87969}What? Now?
{87979}{88015}You'd better come down.
{88100}{88211}l haven't eaten that well in years.|- Yes, it was delicious, Oad.
{88245}{88285}Yeah, it was edible.
{88311}{88385}Can l have another piece?|- Yeah, sure.
{88395}{88449}Here.|- Thanks.
{88503}{88561}Actually it's your mother's birthday.
{88571}{88680}But since l was gone so long,|l have something for everyone.
{88716}{88741}Here!
{88766}{88791}Thanks.
{88945}{88980}Come on, take it.
{88997}{89046}lt's very pretty.
{89116}{89189}This may not be from East Berlin,|but it works.
{89257}{89282}Thanks.
{89548}{89605}Atze, Blacky,|l gotta show you something.
{89729}{89754}Atze?
{89807}{89832}Blacky?
{89904}{90003}That goalscoring wizard Zebec shoots.|But Toni grabs the ball. Bravo, Toni.
{90013}{90123}He throws the ball to Laband|who covers for Posipal ...
{90136}{90161}Mr. Tiburski?
{90193}{90257}What's the score?|- Still nil-nil.
{90324}{90447}But the Yugos are all partisans.|You can only get 'em when you see 'em.
{90499}{90542}Oid you happen to see my rabbits?
{90557}{90594}No, boy, l didn't.
{90622}{90647}Wait a sec.
{90657}{90696}lsn't it your mother's birthday?
{90709}{90734}Yeah, why?
{90744}{90832}He's in the 16-meter zone|and gets tackled by Kohlmeyer.
{90842}{90896}Good old Werner is|worth his weight in gold
{90906}{91010}against the constant|Yugoslavian attack.
