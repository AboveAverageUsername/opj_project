{1076}{1115}l thought you got 'em at market.
{1159}{1192}As if we could afford it!
{1268}{1342}Stop shaking your head at me.|- l'll shake it whenever l like.
{1352}{1444}Shut up and obey!|- ls that all they taught you guys?
{1454}{1484}''You guys''?
{1594}{1647}Since when am l ''you guys''?|- Ooesn't matter.
{1657}{1714}You think l'm a Nazi?
{1724}{1795}One person alone couldn't do a thing.|You had to join them.
{1805}{1866}Sure. Alone you're nothing.|The people are everything.
{1921}{1995}Oon't say that to me!|- Oon't ever hit me again.
{2054}{2135}Oid l hold out for 11 years|to have my son mock me?
{2936}{2995}l don't want the ball anymore.
{3071}{3115}Grabitz's rabbit had babies.
{3125}{3229}l'll get you two if you like.|- l never want rabbits again.
{3239}{3277}l understand.
{3358}{3388}Mom?
{3438}{3515}Was Oad always like that?|- How?
{3578}{3602}So mean.
{3696}{3722}Mattes ...
{3757}{3865}Remember how much it hurt you to know|that Atze and Blacky were gone.
{3891}{3956}Now imagine that it hurts like that|every day
{3966}{4018}for 12 years. Every day.
{4031}{4057}lmagine it.
{4125}{4194}That's how it was for Oad|when he couldn't go home.
{4204}{4244}For 12 years.
{4276}{4309}lt isn't my fault.
{4331}{4366}ls it Oad's fault?
{4411}{4475}See? lt's not our fault.
{4496}{4545}But we can help to make it better.
{4639}{4731}You're a great little guy, kid.
{4804}{4858}Oad's a great guy, too,
{4874}{4915}actually.
{4952}{5024}lf we help him, you'll be surprised|what a great father you've got.
{5055}{5091}We just need to be patient.
{5116}{5166}Everything else will manage itself.
{5275}{5378}Germany was quite lucky to win 2-0|against Yugoslavia.
{5392}{5444}Was it right to focus on defense?
{5454}{5515}Was it right|to put in Rahn for Klodt?
{5526}{5587}Okay, Rahn scored a goal, but
{5598}{5665}how important is he really|for Germany's game?
{5675}{5728}You have it easier than l do, sir.
{5739}{5811}Your game doesn't begin|until ours is over.
{5821}{5886}But since we won,|l think l did everything right.
{5896}{6013}Mr. Herberger! ls it true, Posipal|will be on defense against Austria?
{6023}{6101}That's my plan.|- You can't do that!
{6111}{6154}Jupp is out of shape!
{6164}{6229}We and the home front|are unable to accept that!
{6248}{6292}Posipal's defending against Austria.
{6302}{6388}We want to have a strong defense.|We'll see if l'm right or not.
{6405}{6439}Mr. Herberger!
{6449}{6568}Weren't you wishing the close game|with Yugoslavia would just be over?
{6578}{6624}How did you feel after the game?
{6634}{6681}l've never had that feeling.
{6691}{6764}After the game is before the game.
{6899}{6949}Bruno, what're you doing?
{7012}{7036}Nothing.
{7072}{7108}l'm packing.
{7122}{7146}Where to?
{7191}{7237}l can't tell you.
{7248}{7287}But why are you leaving?
{7392}{7449}Come on, you know.
{7521}{7613}lt just won't work with Oad and me.
{7643}{7690}Sure it'll get better.
{7700}{7803}l wanna leave anyway.|l wanna do something meaningful.
{7904}{7934}Okay ...
{7954}{8019}l'm going to Berlin, to East Berlin.
{8047}{8071}To the Eastern zone?
{8082}{8194}lt's the capital of the GOR.|Everyone's equal there.
{8216}{8269}There's no rich or poor,
{8279}{8342}and no unemployment.|There's freedom of speech.
{8365}{8422}There's no place like that.|- Yes, there is.
{8438}{8497}l've heard they need good musicians.
{8595}{8627}Oon't go!
{8637}{8670}Hey, kid!
{8694}{8780}You're the best man in this family.|That's for sure.
{8790}{8823}l'm relying on you.
{8851}{8910}l can rely on you, can't l?
{9016}{9046}This is for Mom and Oad ...
{9088}{9153}Oon't worry. l didn't write|anything bad, just the truth.
{9163}{9270}But give me a week to get away first,|okay? You promise?
{9352}{9388}Come here.
{10068}{10133}Mr. Lubanski!|- Hello, Pastor.
{10143}{10242}Sorry for disturbing. Got a minute?|- Of course. Come on.
{10264}{10306}Who'd have guessed that?
{10341}{10392}We're in the semi-finals.
{10402}{10496}And one of our boys shot the goal!|- Yeah. - lncredible!
{10511}{10581}We're playing Austria, right?|- Exactly.
{10591}{10670}But that'll be just as difficult ...
{10707}{10778}l'm not really here|to talk about soccer.
{10788}{10843}Of course not. Sorry.
{10870}{10960}l just don't know what to do.|Nothing is the way it was.
{10970}{11029}l try to do everything right.
{11039}{11127}But l just make things worse.|Now Bruno's gone.
{11137}{11216}l've talked to lots|of former prisoners of war.
{11226}{11296}Most of them are ashamed|of the misery they suffered.
{11306}{11437}They exclude their families and try|to act strong, but they're afraid
{11447}{11556}to show their people|what imprisonment did to them.
{12644}{12690}Oidn't you get anything to eat?
{12722}{12779}No, we didn't.
{12841}{12878}You see, actually ...
{12927}{13003}we never got enough to eat.
{13061}{13116}The Russians themselves|didn't have enough either.
{13126}{13218}We had destroyed and burned down|everything they had.
{13301}{13389}l was able to put my hand|around my thigh.
{13399}{13489}Yes, listeners,|it can't be said often enough:
{13500}{13636}Germany in the semi-final.|Who ever thought that would happen?
{13905}{13981}Most important was to see|if you could get up in the morning.
{14052}{14180}First you touched your bunkmate|to see if he was still warm.
{14219}{14256}lf he was still alive.
{14292}{14338}Maybe you could use his boots.
{14443}{14566}After a while they started sending|guys home when they couldn't work.
{14631}{14729}Lots of the guys tried to get sick|'cause they wanted to go home.
{14756}{14791}They drank salt water.
{14831}{14874}And they died.
{15015}{15092}The ones who didn't get dystrophy|and could still walk
{15102}{15189}were sent out in work brigades.
{15221}{15340}They sent me as an expert|to the open-cast mines in Siberia.
{15406}{15471}Oid you ever think about home?
{15561}{15589}l ...
{15626}{15667}l stopped believing in it.
{15720}{15768}l stopped thinking about you.
{15778}{15818}l just counted the winters
{15876}{15927}and thought about eating.
{15980}{16060}Now and then, the farmers|smuggled us something to eat.
{16070}{16111}And on the way back,
{16141}{16214}a Russian took me to his house.
{16224}{16266}He showed me a picture
{16290}{16320}with a ...
{16354}{16448}black ribbon around it.|A picture of his son.
{16681}{16734}l know l've treated you wrong ...
{16796}{16831}But ...
{16866}{16918}l don't know how to act anymore.
{16949}{17006}Everything is so strange here.
{17044}{17091}And with Bruno, that ...
{17112}{17152}was my fault.
{17170}{17275}Bruno couldn't take it here anymore.|He took your place for so long.
{17313}{17376}l think he just wanted to leave.
{17406}{17492}He's old enough|to make that decision.
{17581}{17646}But there are three other people here.
{17656}{17686}They need you.
{17780}{17817}Semi Final Austria vs. Germany 1-6
{17827}{17884}A corner for Germany. What a gift!
{17894}{17971}Will this be the 4th goal?
{17981}{18027}Fritz Walter kicks the corner again
{18037}{18107}with his right foot.|The ball is deflected. Goal!
{18117}{18194}Goal for Germany! Goal!|Otmar Walter,
{18211}{18235}Otmar Walter ...
{18261}{18298}Germany 4, Austria 1!
{18308}{18353}l'm speechless.
{18405}{18471}You can clearly see|that it's almost as if ...
{18481}{18559}When you see their expressions,|even from this distance,
{18569}{18637}our players already seem to be resigned.|lt seems as if ...
{18647}{18711}l'd like ... let's forget it.
{18721}{18801}Happel has passed directly|to the Germans again.
{18811}{18888}What's wrong today? Wagner to Probst,|Probst to Korner 2.
{18898}{18961}Korner 2 tries a trick,|but it doesn't work.
{18971}{19048}Korner 2 passes to Stojaspal|who passes back to Korner 2,
{19058}{19168}who passes back to Probst.|Probst kicks and misses the ball.
{19178}{19246}Korner 2 should have|taken a shot by now.
{19256}{19315}Stojaspal should have|taken a shot by now.
{19326}{19404}But the speed the Germans|are showing today is no magic spell.
{19414}{19456}We're just too slow.
{19466}{19591}Stojaspal wants to pass to Probst,|but he is covered by Liebrich.
{19601}{19720}lt's almost as if Probst were|the baby and Liebrich his mother.
{19855}{19923}So who are we playing|in the final game?
{19933}{20038}You're interested? l thought it was just|''24 men chasing a ball''?
{20048}{20162}You mean recently?|l was just an ignorant child. Well?
{20210}{20238}Hungary!
{20298}{20402}They beat Uruguay 4-2 in overtime.|- What a mess!
{20412}{20478}Those wild and woolly strikers again!
{20488}{20531}Let's hope we don't lose big time.
{20567}{20597}What are you saying?
{20608}{20696}We aren't going to lose again!|That wouldn't be fair!
{20706}{20786}Oh yeah! Good idea! Let's apply|to the FlFA for a fair outcome
{20796}{20877}of the championship!|- Okay, wise guy. l tell you this.
{20887}{20964}We'll win and make shashlik|of the Hungarians!
{20974}{21068}You mean goulash, dear.|- When l say shashlik, l mean shashlik.
{21082}{21143}Okay. What do you bet?
{21193}{21272}lf we have kids,|l get to choose the names.
{21301}{21340}lf Germany wins.
{21366}{21396}Otherwise l do.
{21440}{21517}''As far as l'm concerned, you are|the natural successor to Fritz Walter.
{21527}{21586}Good luck. Yours, Carmen Ballmann.''
{21596}{21620}Well?
{21631}{21728}Carmen Ballmann! Admit it, Horst.|You wrote that yourself!
{21738}{21859}Hey, she's an absolute soccer expert.|There's no doubt about it.
{21883}{21988}Look at that, Fritz. The kids.|l bet we interrupted their prayers.
{21998}{22065}What good little boys.|- Hey, isn't that the guy
{22075}{22148}who crossed the pitch with a guide dog?|- Exactly!
{22158}{22276}Hey, guys. l know you rarely use|your brains, so l'll say this slowly:
{22286}{22343}We are in the final!
{22363}{22469}The game where they drape you|with gold and carry you off the pitch.
{22479}{22554}And they make statues of men like me.|- Or hamburger ...
{22564}{22621}if you don't find the goal soon.|- Right.
{22632}{22669}What about your goals? 6-1!
{22679}{22760}Everybody got to try today,|but you just picked your nose.
{22770}{22881}Come on, let's go where real guys|like us are respected. To Toni's.
{22891}{22952}l gotta give him a talking to|for letting 'em score.
{22998}{23038}Sleep tight, guys.
{23048}{23087}But not 8 goals again.
{23097}{23202}Or they'll say, the Turks were weak,|the Yugoslavians were unlucky ...
{23212}{23279}Right. 4-3 ...|We could live with that.
{23289}{23357}The best thing would be|if they beat us in overtime.
{23367}{23443}l'm fed up with this!|Why are you talking about losing?
{23453}{23526}Why would we lose?|- Of course l want to win, but ...
{23536}{23560}But what?
{23577}{23680}l never thought l'd say this,|but take the Boss, for example.
{23690}{23768}All he talks about|is stuffing Grosics's goal.
{23778}{23833}You know what? He's right.
{23921}{24072}l'd like to thank you for this|unscheduled talk, Mr. Herberger.
{24082}{24141}Wasn't our participation|in the final unscheduled?
{24161}{24239}ls there some kind of secret|about this German team?
{24249}{24318}lt has one brain,|the thinker and leader, Fritz Walter.
{24336}{24397}Our success is unthinkable|without that key figure.
{24407}{24493}lf he'd been injured|we wouldn't be sitting here now.
{24503}{24556}Herberger! Herberger!
{24678}{24702}Strange, huh?
{24713}{24813}Those are the same people|who were hostile to you,
{24823}{24909}because you gave up the first game|for lost.
{24932}{25036}You're wrong. l had a strategy|that was supposed to win the game.
{25046}{25116}Unfortunately, it was a big failure.
{25153}{25245}l don't want to be presumptuous, but
{25259}{25357}do you really think you stand|a chance against Hungary?
{25428}{25538}lf it's sunny, the Hungarians will win.|We won't be able to stop them.
{25548}{25594}Our way of playing's|inferior to theirs.
{25604}{25705}But what if it rains?|That's Fritz Walter weather.
{25736}{25768}The turf gets soggy.
{25804}{25865}Then we stand a chance.
{26341}{26367}Matthias!
{26413}{26476}Matthias, wake up! Come on, wake up!
{26521}{26556}What's up?
{26572}{26635}Get up. We're going on a little trip.
{26864}{26919}Whose car is this?
{26930}{26987}l borrowed it from the pastor.
{26998}{27022}Nice.
{27175}{27213}Where are we going?
{27223}{27292}To Bern, to see the final.|- What?
{27302}{27381}You said the Boss only wins|the big games when you're there.
{27635}{27707}The Final Game
{28120}{28152}Oamn it!
{28224}{28290}Gentlemen, we lost the first game|to Hungary 8-3.
{28300}{28343}That was painful.
{28411}{28461}But as you all know,
{28471}{28567}every good thing|has its bad sides ...
{28588}{28641}and vice versa.
{28662}{28712}So what do 8 goals teach us?
{28771}{28896}Hungary is an exceptional team.|Unbeaten for 4 years.
{28913}{28963}Besides Lorant, Kocsis, Bozsik
{28973}{29091}and Puskas, they only have players|who have never lost
{29101}{29160}with the national team.
{29189}{29279}But that doesn't mean|it isn't possible.
{29308}{29338}Because ...
{29362}{29429}we also scored three goals.
{29463}{29560}That means they're vulnerable.|Here ...
{29610}{29636}on the left.
{29646}{29730}Bozsik is so offensive|that he leaves gaping holes behind him.
{29747}{29812}We have to use that space. Hans ...
{29843}{29914}that goes especially for you.
{29924}{29996}Puskas has recovered.|He'll be playing.
{30006}{30138}He might be weak, but let's assume|that he's dying to go after us.
{30164}{30232}Werner Liebrich is going to cover him.|Now men,
{30242}{30383}if we want to win today,|we have to get Hungary where it hurts.
{30393}{30440}And that isn't Puskas.
{30535}{30573}lt's Hidegkuti!
{30583}{30713}He's just a center-forward,|but he pulls the strings in midfield.
{30723}{30820}He runs their game.|We have to go for him.
{30854}{30969}That's your job, Horst.|Get on his tail and stay there.
{30979}{31032}l want him|to dream about you tonight.
{31133}{31261}We have a big tactical advantage.|We know Hungary's strengths.
{31286}{31402}But they don't know ours.|They don't know how strong we are.
{31450}{31531}They don't know|that we're strong enough to beat them.
{33006}{33121}Adi, get those cleats ready.|- Nothing l'd rather do, Sepp.
{33271}{33347}lt's okay, Wilhelm. We do our best.
{33450}{33547}Hey guys, it's time. Those guys|gotta show that they're real men.
{33557}{33649}We lost the war.|We'll lose the final, too.
{33659}{33705}Oh, Pastor, you're here, too?
{33926}{33992}No idea what's wrong with this crate.
{34027}{34084}l think it's just running|on two cylinders.
{36371}{36430}Germany in the World Cup final,
{36441}{36474}a huge sensation,
{36484}{36541}a real soccer miracle. A miracle
{36551}{36606}that actually came true.
{36616}{36666}We owe it to our players'|sense of the game
{36676}{36794}and the perfection of their style.|The match is about to begin.
{36804}{36898}So, no long introductions,|just the starting lineup.
{36937}{37019}... that beat Austria 6-1|in the opening round.
{37029}{37079}The goalie is Ousseldorf's Turek.
{37089}{37138}Hamburg's Posipal and Kohlmeyer
{37148}{37192}from Kaiserslautern in defense.
{37202}{37282}ln midfield, Eckel and Liebrich|from Kaiserslautern
{37292}{37333}and Mai from Furth.
{37343}{37417}Rahn is the right winger.|He comes from Essen.
{37427}{37471}Then Morlock from Nuremberg,
{37481}{37586}the Walter brothers from Kaiserslautern|and Cologne's Schafer.
{37622}{37712}Referee Link from England has just|blown the whistle to start the game.
{37722}{37870}He's the same official who refereed|the first game against Hungary.
{39024}{39099}Oh shit! This early in the game!
{39109}{39191}Now we don't stand a chance.|- Why can't they watch out?
{39201}{39275}lf this continues, l'm leaving.|Jesus!
{39285}{39367}Our fears have come true.
{39377}{39460}The Hungarians' lightning start|had given them the lead.
{40404}{40534}lt'll be 12-0. And we Germans|will be the fools. Come on, l've had it.
{40559}{40636}A stupid mistake. Just bad luck.
{40646}{40716}But it's still 2-0 for Hungary.
{40730}{40828}lf we have a boy, he'll be Rudiger.|lf it's a girl, she'll be Roswitha.
{40883}{40911}Roswitha?
{41076}{41157}Come on, Germany! Come on, Germany!
{41916}{41955}Come on, guys! Let's go!
{42059}{42128}Come on! We haven't lost yet!
{42206}{42298}l learned a trick|when l was in prison camp.
{42309}{42386}You can do everything|with your imagination.
{42421}{42511}We even imagined|eating as much as we could.
{42523}{42603}And if we weren't too worn down|by our hunger pains,
{42613}{42672}it worked beautifully.
{42698}{42817}Just close your eyes|and you can be anywhere, even in Bern.
{42848}{42911}lt's as if you were really there.
{42951}{42998}Come on, try it!
{43995}{44019}Goal!
{44045}{44096}Goal for Germany!|- What did l say?
{44127}{44173}Maybe we'll get there by half-time.
{44233}{44299}lt's only 2-1 now. Rahn's shot
{44309}{44383}was deflected|by a Hungarian defender.
{44393}{44448}Max Morlock spread his legs and slid
{44458}{44530}into the ball, nudging it|with his remaining strength
{44540}{44597}past the Hungarian goalkeeper,|Grosics.
{44607}{44701}Thank God. lt's no longer 2-0.|lt's now 2-1.
{44711}{44748}lt's encouraging
{44758}{44815}and boosts our team's self-confidence.
{45470}{45519}Goal! Goal!
{45602}{45663}Rahn has scored! lt's now 2-2.
{45682}{45739}lt's all even again.
{46342}{46376}You never pass!
{46386}{46489}Morlock was wide open in front of|the goal, and you shot into empty space!
{46499}{46576}Look out for your defense, kiddo.|Those two goals were giveaways.
{46586}{46656}What got into you guys?|We can't make up for all your mistakes.
{46666}{46754}Tell that to Kohli.|He can't even pass to the goalie.
{46765}{46862}You cling to that line, fatty.|- Hey, ''playmaker'', are you blind?
{46872}{46954}Why do l run my lungs out|if you can't even pass to Fritz?
{46965}{47024}Quiet down! Right now!
{47059}{47141}Save your breath. You'll need it.
{47151}{47236}Haven't you realized it yet?|We can be world champions!
{47246}{47361}And you have nothing better to do|than yell at each other. lt's 2-2.
{47378}{47491}The Hungarians are mad. They're gonna|jump all over you in the 2nd half.
{47501}{47622}So watch out! You gotta keep it up|for 45 more minutes!
{47632}{47764}Go out and fight!|One for all, all for one! ls that clear?
{47810}{47887}Really exciting, huh?|- You bet.
{47921}{48031}Matthias, l wanted to apologize to you.|You know, about the rabbits.
{48062}{48097}That's okay.
{48113}{48201}l just wanted us to have good food|on Mother's birthday.
{48250}{48302}We are reporting again from Bern.
{48312}{48373}The score at the start|of the 2nd half is 2-2.
{48384}{48449}Hungary's two goals were scored|by Puskas and Czibor,
{48459}{48543}Germany's goals by Morlock and Rahn.
{50162}{50248}Welcome to the World Cup
{50554}{50610}Buzanszki's header hits the crossbar.
{50620}{50690}A close call, but the ball is ...
{50700}{50770}We can't get any closer.|We'll meet here. Get going.
{50780}{50839}You come too, Oad.|- Go on, get moving.
{50850}{50926}They can't win without you.|You're faster without me.
{51000}{51108}Hungary's throw-in ...|Lantos shoots!
{51118}{51208}Liebrich stops the ball.|Kocsis from the left wing ...
{51218}{51277}The ball is cleared!
{51529}{51561}Turek clears the ball!
{51571}{51681}Turek, you're a super guy!|Turek, you're a soccer god!
{51691}{51765}Please, excuse my excitement.
{51775}{51850}Soccer laymen will think we're crazy!
{51860}{51950}But remember,|today is truly Germany's soccer day.
{51960}{52079}Hidegkuti's shot blasted|at Germany's goal from just 3 meters
{52089}{52164}is blocked by Turek.
{52300}{52390}6 minutes left in Wankdorf Stadium|in Bern. Nobody is giving way.
{52401}{52539}lt's raining incessantly.|But the spectators aren't leaving.
{52549}{52627}How could they?|The World Cup takes place every 4 years.
{52637}{52708}And how many games|are so evenly matched, so exciting?
{52718}{52757}Rahn is fouled!
{54011}{54103}Bozsik, always Bozsik,|the Hungarian midfielder, with the ball.
{54113}{54180}He loses the ball|to Schafer this time.
{54190}{54274}Schafer passes to midfield!|A head ball! The ball is cleared!
{54309}{54384}Rahn should take a shot.|He shoots!
{54414}{54484}Goal! Goal! Goal!
{54861}{54926}3-2 for Germany over Hungary,
{54936}{55014}a team that hasn't lost a game|for 4 1/ 2 years.
{55024}{55135}The second hand is moving so slowly.|l stare over at it.
{55145}{55208}Speed up! Faster! But ist doesn't.
{55218}{55314}lt moves with the precision|it's been designed to have.
{55324}{55410}Now only 1 1/ 2 or 2 minutes.|Germany leads 3-2.
{55424}{55508}The Hungarians are going wild.|Puskas with the ball at the center.
{55518}{55612}The Hungarians have a chance.|Pass to the right wing, Czibor.
{55622}{55718}Shoots ...|Toni grabs the ball. He's got it!
{55777}{55819}45 minutes are over.
{55829}{55923}No more than a minute extra time.|But it's risky.
{55934}{56030}Hungary on the right wing ... Fritz|Walter kicks the ball out of the bounds.
{56048}{56138}Who could blame him?|Hungary gets a throw-in.
{56149}{56202}The ball is thrown in ... to Bozsik.
{56235}{56310}lt's over! Over! Over!
{56328}{56362}The game is over!
{56374}{56419}Germany are world champions!
