3
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:44,013
We`re very proud of Judah Rosenthal`s
philanthropic efforts...

4
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,384
...his endless hours of fundraising
for the hospital...

5
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:50,559
...the new medical center...

6
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,591
...and the ophthalmology wing...

7
00:01:52,795 --> 00:01:55,992
...which, until this year,
had just been a dream.

8
00:01:56,432 --> 00:02:00,732
But it`s Judah Rosenthal, our friend,
that we most appreciate.

9
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:04,667
The husband, the father,
the golf companion.

10
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,502
-For medical problems...
-You`re blushing.

11
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,704
...call him day or night, weekends,
or holidays. But you can also call...

12
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:17,318
...to ask about the best restaurant
in Paris. Or Athens.

13
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,182
Or which hotel to stay at in Moscow.

14
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:24,485
Or the best recording
of a particular Mozart symphony.

15
00:02:24,693 --> 00:02:27,821
My father is so nervous
about having to speak.

16
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,262
l knew he was nervous when you didn`t
eat any cocktail weenies.

17
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:36,404
He was so courageous all week.
Then suddenly tonight, stage fright.

18
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:40,507
Judah, you were fine till you
got home from work today.

19
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:41,932
Any mail?

20
00:02:42,144 --> 00:02:44,874
The mail`s where
l left it this morning.

21
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,275
l haven`t had a second all day.

22
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:51,078
lf you`re gonna shower, do it.
l have to use it too.

23
00:02:52,154 --> 00:02:54,622
l dread making that speech tonight.

24
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:20,382
Dear Miriam Rosenthal,`

25
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:24,815
I`m at the lowest point of my life
as I write you this letter,

26
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,548
I wish to cause no suffering,
but because I`m going through hell,,,

27
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:32,420
,,,I ask if you can meet me one time,

28
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:36,393
Your husband and I
are more than friends,,,

29
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:41,036
,,,and have been deeply in love
for over two years now,

30
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:42,534
This must be faced,,,

31
00:03:42,738 --> 00:03:46,196
,,,as there are many
ramifications and complications,

32
00:03:46,408 --> 00:03:49,400
Many promises were made, et cetera,

33
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:53,337
I need an open exchange
with you to clear things,

34
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:55,414
For all of us to go on,,,

35
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:59,918
,,, the situation has got to be
confronted in some fashion,

36
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:03,023
Please contact me at this number,

37
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:05,785
I want what`s best for everyone,

38
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,690
Dolores Paley,

39
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,787
That the new ophthalmology wing
has become a reality...

40
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:39,859
...is not just a tribute to me
but to a spirit of community...

41
00:04:40,062 --> 00:04:43,998
...generosity, of mutual caring
and answered prayers.

42
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:48,032
lt`s funny l use the term
``answered prayers.``

43
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:49,795
l`m a man of science.

44
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:53,964
l`ve always been a skeptic,
but l was raised religiously.

45
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:56,474
l challenged it, even as a child...

46
00:04:57,179 --> 00:05:00,205
,,,but some of that feeling
stuck with me,

47
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:03,215
I remember my father telling me,`

48
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,286
``The eyes of God are on us always, ``

49
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:08,484
``The eyes of God.``

50
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:12,121
What a phrase to a young boy.

51
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:14,956
l mean, what were God`s eyes like?

52
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:19,734
Unimaginably penetrating,
intense eyes, l assumed.

53
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:25,939
l wonder if it was just a coincidence
that l specialized in ophthalmology.

54
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:32,810
l`m so proud of you, Judah.
Sharon is, we all are.

55
00:05:33,582 --> 00:05:35,174
All together.

56
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:03,203
-Why did you write the letter?
-We`ve been through it.

57
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:05,539
You wanna destroy my family?

58
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:08,114
l want her to know her husband.

59
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:12,913
lt was lying there all day.
By sheer chance, she didn`t open it.

60
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,148
You said you`d leave Miriam!
We made plans!

61
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:17,484
-l didn`t.
-You did!

62
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:19,422
l gave up opportunities!

63
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:21,926
-Pipe dreams.
-Other men wanted me.

64
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,964
What do you want?
You think this is easy?

65
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:28,659
l want what you told me
you wanted, to be together.

66
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:32,671
Otherwise, l don`t know what!
l`ll jump out the window!

67
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:37,005
You`ve been my whole life
for two years. l can`t go back.

68
00:06:37,212 --> 00:06:39,305
You turned my life around!

69
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:42,279
l never said l`d leave Miriam.

70
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:45,920
``There`s no passion left.``
Those are your words...

71
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:49,955
...unless you lied.
Or there`s something l don`t know.

72
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:54,459
-Have you met someone else?
-What? For God`s sake, Dolores.

73
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:56,392
-Dolores--
-What?

74
00:06:56,632 --> 00:06:57,929
Now, look.

75
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:02,229
l`ve lived with her 25 years.
The roots are very deep.

76
00:07:02,438 --> 00:07:04,497
l can`t go on leading two lives.

77
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:09,303
You`re not doing her a favor by
pretending. l won`t be without you.

78
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:13,607
This won`t happen without a fight!
l wanna speak to Miriam!

79
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:15,807
-Nothing`s happening, okay?
-No!

80
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,384
Yes! Listen to me, please.

81
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:22,648
We`ll work something out.
Let me get my thoughts together.

82
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:25,019
Just don`t do anything rash.

83
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,592
Dolores.

84
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:29,488
What?

85
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:34,593
lt`s gonna be okay.

86
00:07:37,372 --> 00:07:38,999
Oh, God.

87
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:41,767
-You were gonna wait--
-Annie--

88
00:07:41,977 --> 00:07:44,844
-Then throw me aside!
-Don`t dramatize,

89
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:49,108
I`ve given you the best years
of my life!

90
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:50,376
Get out of here!

91
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:53,282
I know what you are,
Lucky I found out!

92
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:55,514
Those are my clothes!

93
00:07:59,128 --> 00:08:00,425
That was great.

94
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:03,462
-The tuxedos, the evening gowns.
-Great.

95
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:07,101
lt was wonderful to live like that.
This is awful.

96
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:10,396
Let me get a cab. You stay here.

97
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:14,508
-You wanna see a movie again tomorrow?
-Sure, Uncle Cliff.

98
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,699
Jesus.

99
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:19,005
Unless maybe we should
make it a museum day.

100
00:08:19,214 --> 00:08:24,117
l promised your dad on his deathbed
you`d get a well-rounded education.

101
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,050
We probably shouldn`t
go to the movies every day...

102
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,884
...even though l`d love to.

103
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,060
While we wait for a cab...

104
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,821
...l`ll give you
your lesson for today.

105
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,554
Your lesson is this:

106
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:39,495
Don`t listen to what
your teachers say.

107
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:41,794
Just see what they look like.

108
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:45,235
Then you`ll know what life
will really be like.

109
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,637
You heard it here first.
l see a cab. lf we run...

110
00:08:48,844 --> 00:08:52,569
...we can kick the crutch
from that old lady and get it.

111
00:08:54,604 --> 00:08:57,300
-l`m back!
-Where were you?

112
00:08:57,507 --> 00:09:01,603
-Just out and around.
-Took your niece to a movie again.

113
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:04,974
l`m crazy about that kid.
She`s just great.

114
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:08,878
My brother`s in town.
He asked us to a dinner party.

115
00:09:09,085 --> 00:09:12,452
-Jesus.
-Please. You gonna make another scene?

116
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:16,853
-l didn`t do that last time.
-You did. Your resentment showed.

117
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:22,327
l don`t resent him. He`s a pompous ass.
You don`t see it since you love him.

118
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:24,193
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

119
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:26,892
You did. You`re running down Lester.

120
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:30,561
-l like your brother Ben.
-You`re not jealous of him.

121
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:33,607
l`m jealous because
he`s a TV producer?

122
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,610
No. Because he`s highly respected
and he`s a millionaire...

123
00:09:37,814 --> 00:09:40,180
...and doing what you`d like to do.

124
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:43,841
Listen, l can`t watch his stuff.
lt`s submental.

125
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:47,785
-He wants to talk to you about a job.
-l don`t need one.

126
00:09:47,991 --> 00:09:50,459
Didn`t l get honorable mention at--?

127
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,561
The Cincinnati Documentary
Film Festival?

128
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:57,426
Everybody got honorable mention
who showed up.

129
00:09:57,634 --> 00:10:00,660
Boy, things have really
changed around here.

130
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:11,409
Wendy, Cliff, meet Lisa.

131
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:14,777
My sister, Wendy.
My brother-in-law, Clifford.

132
00:10:14,984 --> 00:10:18,784
-Lisa`s starring in my new series.
-Not really starring.

133
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:22,651
You`re one of the stars.
lt`s an ensemble piece.

134
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:25,225
-Hello, Lester.
-Hello, darling.

135
00:10:25,428 --> 00:10:28,591
-So glad you came.
-Thank you for inviting me.

136
00:10:28,798 --> 00:10:32,029
Have a drink. l`ll be right there.

137
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:35,898
She gave a bundle to
The Museum of Broadcasting.

138
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:40,140
-She plays a--
-A lawyer for the ACLU.

139
00:10:40,343 --> 00:10:42,868
Married to a conservative writer.

140
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:46,412
-So we can get into issues.
-We`ll try to be fair.

141
00:10:46,616 --> 00:10:49,949
But knowing Lester,
he`ll slant it to the left.

142
00:10:50,153 --> 00:10:51,177
Let`s hope so.

143
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:53,855
-We`re shooting here.
-You`ll be here?

144
00:10:54,057 --> 00:10:56,321
l wanna shoot more in New York.

145
00:10:56,526 --> 00:10:58,460
-Oh, great.
-l love this town.

146
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:01,789
Out there is such
a Mickey Mouse environment.

147
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:03,397
The reason l`m here--

148
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,263
-Hello, Lester.
-l wanna talk to you. Don`t go away.

149
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,598
A bunch of us are getting together...

150
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:13,537
...to build a studio here in the city.

151
00:11:13,743 --> 00:11:17,042
ln fact-- l`m sorry,
just give me one second.

152
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:18,680
ldea for series:

153
00:11:18,882 --> 00:11:22,215
A high-profile builder,
with grandiose dreams...

154
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:25,387
...a lá Donald Trump.
Shot in New York.

155
00:11:25,588 --> 00:11:28,386
-Look who`s here.
-That`s my brother Ben.

156
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:32,118
Ben, Carol, come here.
Hi, kid. Nice to see you.

157
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:34,690
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, sweetheart.

158
00:11:34,898 --> 00:11:37,992
-Hi, Cliff.
-How you doing? How are your eyes?

159
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:40,999
Not so good. lt`s not so optimistic.

160
00:11:41,204 --> 00:11:43,468
l`ve been seeing Dr. Rosenthal.

161
00:11:43,673 --> 00:11:46,642
Lester, don`t you want
to talk to Clifford?

162
00:11:46,843 --> 00:11:49,437
Oh, yeah. Step into my office.

163
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:54,078
-Hi, l`m Lisa.
-Hi. We didn`t meet. l`m sorry.

164
00:11:54,284 --> 00:11:57,720
-So are you in TV too?
-No.

165
00:11:57,921 --> 00:11:59,752
No. l`m a rabbi.

166
00:12:00,557 --> 00:12:03,424
You don`t wear an outfit or anything?

167
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:06,985
Public television wants to do
a documentary...

168
00:12:07,197 --> 00:12:09,495
...on the way l talk and think--

169
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:12,896
lt`s part of their
Creative Mind series.

170
00:12:13,102 --> 00:12:15,400
So l told them about you.

171
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:18,267
Thanks. l`m working on my own thing.

172
00:12:18,474 --> 00:12:20,499
-A little film.
-Wendy told me.

173
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,238
A film about some philosophy
professor, which is admirable.

174
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:30,078
But this is a chance to earn
decent money, reach a big audience.

175
00:12:30,286 --> 00:12:33,380
Last thing you need
is me as your biographer.

176
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:37,959
l make these little films on
toxic waste and starving children.

177
00:12:38,161 --> 00:12:42,757
l`ll be frank. You`re not my
first choice. lt`s a favor to Wendy.

178
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:47,733
-You never work. She`s embarrassed.
-l`ve worked, but nobody pays me.

179
00:12:47,937 --> 00:12:50,462
l know you don`t respect what l do.

180
00:12:50,673 --> 00:12:53,107
But l got a closet full of Emmys.

181
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:56,506
You think that`s bullshit.
Fine. l understand.

182
00:12:56,713 --> 00:13:00,205
Maybe l could use the money
to finish my movie.

183
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,111
l do have some debts.

184
00:13:02,318 --> 00:13:03,683
ldea for farce:

185
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:08,220
A poor loser agrees to do
the story of a great man`s life.

186
00:13:08,424 --> 00:13:11,359
And in the process,
he learns deep values.

187
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:18,533
-What takes you to Boston?
-I`m lecturing at a symposium,

188
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:21,135
lncidentally, my name`s Dolores.

189
00:13:21,337 --> 00:13:23,032
-Hello, Dolores.
-Hello.

190
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:25,332
-Pretty name.
-Thank you.

191
00:13:25,975 --> 00:13:29,342
-Do you go to Boston often?
-Not very often,

192
00:13:29,545 --> 00:13:32,343
I don`t know anyone
in Boston, actually,

193
00:13:32,548 --> 00:13:33,981
-Really?
-Yeah,

194
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:43,347
-Morning.
-Hi.

195
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,528
A Miss Paley called,
said it was urgent.

196
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:56,537
Why did you phone me?
l told you l`d call you.

197
00:13:56,739 --> 00:14:00,766
l couldn`t help it.
l was going out of my skin.

198
00:14:02,712 --> 00:14:04,680
l have to see you later.

199
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:06,605
l have to!

200
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:09,177
Okay.

201
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:12,086
After work is okay.

202
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:16,552
l see it.

203
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,749
Yeah.

204
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:21,024
l see it.

205
00:14:22,465 --> 00:14:24,399
Oh, God.

206
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:26,328
What?

207
00:14:27,804 --> 00:14:29,704
l need to take a minute.

208
00:14:32,108 --> 00:14:33,575
What`s wrong, Judah?

209
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:37,204
l`m in such trouble, Ben.

210
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,811
What is it?

211
00:14:39,882 --> 00:14:42,009
l need to talk to someone.

212
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:43,678
Sure.

213
00:14:45,054 --> 00:14:48,956
l`ve known you for years.
You`re religious. l`m not.

214
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:52,958
We`ve differed on many points,
but l do respect you.

215
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,665
-May l confide in you?
-Of course.

216
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,094
Go ahead. Everything`s confidential.

217
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:06,637
l`ve done a foolish thing.

218
00:15:06,843 --> 00:15:08,640
Senseless. Vain.

219
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:10,039
Dumb.

220
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:15,107
Another woman.

221
00:15:19,522 --> 00:15:23,925
Maybe l was flattered, vulnerable.

222
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:26,857
Maybe because she was
helpless and alone.

223
00:15:27,063 --> 00:15:29,964
But now my life`s
about to go up in smoke.

224
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:34,027
-Can`t you break it off?
-The woman won`t allow it.

225
00:15:34,537 --> 00:15:37,370
She`s young. She`s very unstable.

226
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:39,097
She`s an hysteric.

227
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:41,033
And vindictive.

228
00:15:41,277 --> 00:15:42,835
And it`s my fault.

229
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:46,105
l instigated it. l prolonged it.

230
00:15:46,315 --> 00:15:49,409
l tried to back off,
but l was too weak.

231
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:52,213
But l promised her nothing.

232
00:15:52,422 --> 00:15:55,220
But did l? l don`t even know anymore.

233
00:15:55,425 --> 00:15:58,417
ln the heat of passion,
you say things.

234
00:15:58,628 --> 00:16:01,825
After two years of living
this double life...

235
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:04,295
...l awakened as if from a dream...

236
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,300
-...and realized what l`d be losing.
-lt`s called wisdom.

237
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:10,631
lt comes to some suddenly.

238
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,833
We realize the difference between
what`s deep and lasting...

239
00:16:15,044 --> 00:16:18,377
...versus the superficial
payoff of the moment.

240
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:22,881
l kidded myself about loving her,
but deep down l knew.

241
00:16:23,085 --> 00:16:25,212
Knowing l behaved selfishly...

242
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:27,981
...for pleasure,
for adventure, for lust.

243
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:30,853
Sometimes, when there`s real love...

244
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,154
...and true acknowledgment
of a mistake...

245
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:36,729
...there can be forgiveness too.

246
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:38,730
l know Miriam.

247
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:42,836
Her values, her feelings,
her place among our friends.

248
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,440
What choice do you have
if the woman`s gonna tell?

249
00:16:46,642 --> 00:16:50,738
You have to confess the wrong
and hope for understanding.

250
00:16:50,947 --> 00:16:54,212
Maybe Miriam`s responsible,
in some ways too.

251
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:57,511
You have to discuss it
and hope for the best.

252
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,655
Maybe you can never
go back to the old life...

253
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:05,055
...but maybe there`s a new one
with maturity and understanding.

254
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:07,320
Maybe even a richer one.

255
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:13,531
You know what`s funny?
Our entire adult lives...

256
00:17:13,736 --> 00:17:18,537
...we`ve been having this same
conversation in one form or another.

257
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:22,973
lt`s a fundamental difference
in the way we view the world.

258
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:26,637
You see it as harsh,
empty of values and pitiless.

259
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:29,943
And l couldn`t go on living
if l didn`t feel...

260
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:33,644
...a moral structure
with real meaning...

261
00:17:33,856 --> 00:17:36,552
...and forgiveness
and some higher power.

262
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:40,195
Otherwise, there`s no basis
to know how to live.

263
00:17:40,396 --> 00:17:42,887
And l know a spark of that notion...

264
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:45,329
...is inside you somewhere too.

265
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:48,504
You`re talking to me
like your congregation.

266
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:54,469
True. We went from a small infidelity
to the meaning of existence.

267
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:59,105
Miriam won`t think two years
of scheming and dishonesty...

268
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:02,658
...is a small infidelity.

269
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,494
How can you do it?

270
00:18:16,705 --> 00:18:20,402
l give up.
God, you`re in such wonderful shape.

271
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:23,769
-For a man my age.
-For any age.

272
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:26,470
l was athletic as a young student.

273
00:18:26,682 --> 00:18:29,480
You still make love
like a young student.

274
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,450
l don`t think we should do this here.

275
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:40,617
-Why not? We`re alone.
-l don`t know. l feel self-conscious.

276
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:44,697
Let`s go to the cottage.
You can play me the Schumann.

277
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,197
Schubert.

278
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:48,392
Schumann is flowery.

279
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:49,571
Schubert is....

280
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:52,672
lt reminds me of you. The sad one.

281
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,366
God, you have to teach me all that.

282
00:18:55,577 --> 00:18:59,035
-l`m so ignorant in classical music.
-l`ll teach you.

283
00:18:59,248 --> 00:19:02,342
Someday, we`ll have a lot of time,

284
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:19,534
Would you like a drink?

285
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:24,130
Yeah. Fix me whatever you`re having.

286
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:36,818
Why`d you call the house
last night and hang up?

287
00:19:37,452 --> 00:19:42,389
Just because you`ve decided
l`m through in your life...

288
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:45,219
...doesn`t mean
l`ll roll over and die.

289
00:19:45,427 --> 00:19:47,657
What the hell happened to us?

290
00:19:47,996 --> 00:19:52,433
We had a wonderful few years.
We knew it couldn`t go on forever.

291
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:55,660
-l gave up things for you.
-That`s poppycock.

292
00:19:55,871 --> 00:19:58,772
Don`t give me that. For God`s sakes.

293
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:02,102
There were no business opportunities.

294
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:07,044
No lovers begging for your hand.
l prevented nothing. l--

295
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:10,184
Can we not argue?
l just wanted to talk.

296
00:20:10,385 --> 00:20:12,478
l`m just so rattled.

297
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:14,818
l had an idea.

298
00:20:15,724 --> 00:20:17,851
l thought if we could get away...

299
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,120
...just for a little while
on one of our trips.

300
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,730
Our trips are my warmest memories.

301
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:28,164
Not just in our relationship,
but the best times l`ve ever had.

302
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,134
You`re always so relaxed
away from home.

303
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,103
You come to life.

304
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:38,268
Your whole face changes.
l thought if we could just get away...

305
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,473
...to Boston or Washington
without any preconceived notions.

306
00:20:42,684 --> 00:20:44,777
l can`t go away, Del.

307
00:20:46,688 --> 00:20:48,553
-Just a weekend--
-l can`t!

308
00:20:48,757 --> 00:20:50,418
-Why not?
-l can`t.

309
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:53,823
-You won`t.
-Of course l won`t. Right.

310
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,355
Why not?

311
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:03,502
Because you`re very unrealistic,
you know that?

312
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:06,466
Sit down for a second.

313
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:08,476
Let`s talk.

314
00:21:11,747 --> 00:21:12,975
Look.

315
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:14,612
l`ve been--

316
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,085
l`ve been thinking too.

317
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:21,946
And if l have caused you...

318
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:26,389
...to miss opportunities that
might have been lucrative for you...

319
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:30,622
...l`m perfectly prepared
to reimburse you. l don`t want to--

320
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,300
l`m not after your goddamn money!

321
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:37,632
l wanna speak to Miriam!
lt`s her problem too! She should know.

322
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,069
Keep her out of it, all right?

323
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:46,812
She should know her husband`s
a liar and an embezzler.

324
00:21:50,886 --> 00:21:53,446
Don`t you dare call me an embezzler.

325
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:59,618
l know what went on between
those philanthropies and your stocks.

326
00:21:59,828 --> 00:22:03,787
l took nothing, not a nickel.
My conscience is clear.

327
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:07,230
You needed money to cover
your losses. l saw.

328
00:22:07,436 --> 00:22:09,996
Okay, l needed some temporary help.

329
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:13,174
For chrissake, after
a lifetime of hard work...

330
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,776
...a man doesn`t watch himself
go down the toilet.

331
00:22:16,978 --> 00:22:20,038
Moving around funds
is certainly not stealing.

332
00:22:20,782 --> 00:22:21,908
Without asking?

333
00:22:22,117 --> 00:22:25,211
Every cent was accounted for,
with interest.

334
00:22:26,588 --> 00:22:30,888
-l don`t think they`d see it that way.
-So this is your plan?

335
00:22:31,093 --> 00:22:33,493
You`ll hold on to me with threats?

336
00:22:33,695 --> 00:22:37,324
Stupid threats and slander--
This is your idea of love?

337
00:22:37,532 --> 00:22:40,558
l won`t be tossed out!
l`ll speak to Miriam!

338
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:44,603
For chrissake! Think what
the hell you`re doing to me!

339
00:22:44,806 --> 00:22:46,068
Please!

340
00:22:46,274 --> 00:22:48,265
l can`t figure it out.

341
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,302
l need you.

342
00:22:51,813 --> 00:22:53,144
Del.

343
00:22:54,683 --> 00:22:57,652
l love New York.
l was born in that building.

344
00:22:57,853 --> 00:23:00,845
Behind the statue there
on the pedestal.

345
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:04,116
New York is like thousands
of straight lines...

346
00:23:04,326 --> 00:23:06,089
...looking for a punch line.

347
00:23:07,229 --> 00:23:09,789
What makes New York
such a funny place...

348
00:23:09,998 --> 00:23:13,627
...is that there`s so much tension,
pain and craziness.

349
00:23:13,835 --> 00:23:18,397
That`s the first part of comedy.
But you gotta get some distance.

350
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:23,101
The thing to remember about comedy is,
if it bends, it`s funny.

351
00:23:23,311 --> 00:23:27,270
lf it breaks, it`s not.
You gotta get back from the pain.

352
00:23:28,717 --> 00:23:33,051
A bunch of kids up at Harvard
asked me, ``What`s comedy?``

353
00:23:33,255 --> 00:23:37,282
This is what l`m trying to say
about getting back from it.

354
00:23:37,492 --> 00:23:40,359
l said, ``Comedy is tragedy plus time.``

355
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:42,360
``Tragedy plus time.``

356
00:23:42,564 --> 00:23:45,965
When Lincoln was shot,
you couldn`t joke about it.

357
00:23:46,168 --> 00:23:48,136
You just couldn`t do it.

358
00:23:48,336 --> 00:23:52,067
Now time has gone by,
and now it`s fair game.

359
00:23:52,274 --> 00:23:54,333
lt`s tragedy plus time.

360
00:23:54,543 --> 00:23:56,010
Okay. We`re out.

361
00:23:56,211 --> 00:24:00,392
-That`s it? So fast?
-l shot 1 0 rolls on the first question.

362
00:24:00,892 --> 00:24:06,125
l gotta get to CBS. Remember where we
were. Just remember what l was saying.

363
00:24:06,331 --> 00:24:07,992
-All right?
-Excellent.

364
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,293
l think l`m too cute.

365
00:24:10,502 --> 00:24:13,699
l`ll be relaxed tomorrow.
More tragedy stuff.

366
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:17,568
-Halley Reed for Mr. Curtis.
-Would you excuse us?

367
00:24:17,776 --> 00:24:21,473
lf you play your cards right,
you could have my body.

368
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,478
Wouldn`t you rather
leave it to science?

369
00:24:24,683 --> 00:24:27,811
l offer you my heart
and you squash it.

370
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:30,351
When are you gonna work for me?

371
00:24:30,555 --> 00:24:33,490
You`d fire me.
l`m much too opinionated.

372
00:24:33,692 --> 00:24:35,353
-No, no.
-l`ll wait.

373
00:24:35,594 --> 00:24:39,530
-l like mental stimulation.
-You tried shock therapy?

374
00:24:39,731 --> 00:24:42,859
-That`s good. That`s funny!
-We`ve gotta go.

375
00:24:43,068 --> 00:24:45,969
-l`ll be right with you.
-But it`s 5--

376
00:24:46,171 --> 00:24:48,435
-Arthur, wait in the car.
-Please?

377
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,505
Yes. Wait in the car.

378
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:53,940
Yes. l was holding for Mr. Curtis.

379
00:24:54,145 --> 00:24:58,775
Why not come with me to Barbados?
We`ll swim, get some sun....

380
00:24:58,984 --> 00:25:03,546
-Sorry. l freckle.
-My best shot. l can`t do any better.

381
00:25:03,755 --> 00:25:05,222
Okay. l`ll wait.

382
00:25:05,423 --> 00:25:08,483
Please think about it.
Talk to you tomorrow.

383
00:25:17,335 --> 00:25:20,236
Yeah. lt`s Halley Reed.
You cut me off.

384
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,971
We haven`t officially met.

385
00:25:24,175 --> 00:25:28,077
-Halley Reed, associate producer.
-l`m Clifford Stern.

386
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,683
Can l ask you something?
Why do you bother with this guy?

387
00:25:32,884 --> 00:25:36,684
He`s a pompous bore,
and your show does great profiles.

388
00:25:36,888 --> 00:25:40,483
Just between us, l wanted
Gabriel García Márquez.

389
00:25:40,692 --> 00:25:43,855
-That`s perfect.
-They like a little variety.

390
00:25:44,062 --> 00:25:47,691
-He is an American phenomenon.
-But so is acid rain.

391
00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:49,696
You really don`t like him.

392
00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:53,064
``l love him like a brother,``
David Greenglass.

393
00:25:53,271 --> 00:25:55,535
So why are you doing this show?

394
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,573
They rarely hire an outside person.

395
00:25:58,777 --> 00:26:01,644
l`m doing it strictly for the money.

396
00:26:01,846 --> 00:26:05,509
l`m trying to make my own
documentary on a guy...

397
00:26:05,717 --> 00:26:08,277
...who`d be perfect for your show.

398
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:10,750
-Who?
-His name is Louis Levy.

399
00:26:10,956 --> 00:26:14,153
Do you have a little time?

400
00:26:14,693 --> 00:26:17,628
Now, the unique thing that happened,,,

401
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:19,990
,,, to the early Israelites,,,

402
00:26:20,198 --> 00:26:23,827
,,,was that they conceived
a God that cares,

403
00:26:24,035 --> 00:26:27,095
He cares, but at the same time,,,

404
00:26:27,305 --> 00:26:31,708
,,,he also demands
that you behave morally,

405
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,901
But here comes the paradox,

406
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,878
What`s one of the first things
that that God asks?

407
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,244
That God asks Abraham,,,

408
00:26:40,452 --> 00:26:43,580
,,, to sacrifice his only son,,,

409
00:26:43,788 --> 00:26:46,018
,,,his beloved son to him,

410
00:26:46,224 --> 00:26:50,217
In other words, in spite
of millennia of efforts,,,

411
00:26:50,428 --> 00:26:52,896
,,,we have not succeeded to create,,,

412
00:26:53,098 --> 00:26:57,330
,,,a really and entirely
loving image of God,

413
00:26:57,535 --> 00:27:01,027
This was beyond our capacity
to imagine,

414
00:27:02,574 --> 00:27:05,168
-He`s really interesting.
-l know.

415
00:27:05,377 --> 00:27:09,711
-He`d be wonderful for the series.
-Wanna dump Lester and do him?

416
00:27:09,914 --> 00:27:13,077
-Because l would love--
-We can`t dump Lester.

417
00:27:13,284 --> 00:27:16,253
But l could get
some financing for you.

418
00:27:16,454 --> 00:27:19,651
And if all this comes
together right...

419
00:27:19,858 --> 00:27:23,157
...we got some free spots
in the fall schedule.

420
00:27:23,361 --> 00:27:27,593
To get this on your series
would be such a feather in my cap.

421
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:30,267
That would be my biggest audience.

422
00:27:30,468 --> 00:27:33,028
Great. Let`s make it happen.

423
00:27:33,238 --> 00:27:36,173
l`ve got good footage.
Although we just met...

424
00:27:36,374 --> 00:27:39,901
-...l`ve taken a liking to you.
-And l to him.

425
00:27:44,282 --> 00:27:47,445
l thought l`d come by.
l got Jenny a present.

426
00:27:47,652 --> 00:27:51,281
-ls that you, Uncle Cliff?
-Yes, l got you something.

427
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:56,119
l got you a great book, an absolutely
terrific book. How are you?

428
00:27:56,327 --> 00:27:59,353
lt has great pictures
of old New York in it.

429
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:02,761
Look at this.
This is old Fifth Avenue.

430
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:05,492
-lt`s great.
-Carriages and top hats.

431
00:28:05,703 --> 00:28:08,433
There`s a whole section
on speakeasies.

432
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,905
That`s the Flatiron Building.
lt`s very famous.

433
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,772
l had a creative breakthrough today.

434
00:28:14,979 --> 00:28:18,938
l heard you got some action
on your personal ad. Terrific.

435
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,710
Here`s the old Madison Square Garden.

436
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,889
-Jen, don`t you have some homework?
-Yeah.

437
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:28,287
-We`ll look at this later.
-Yeah. Thanks a lot.

438
00:28:30,495 --> 00:28:32,360
What`s the matter?

439
00:28:32,564 --> 00:28:33,826
l`m a wreck.

440
00:28:34,032 --> 00:28:36,023
What is it?

441
00:28:36,634 --> 00:28:38,363
l`m a wreck.

442
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,094
Barbara.

443
00:28:40,305 --> 00:28:43,069
Barbara, what`s the matter?

444
00:28:43,274 --> 00:28:45,367
-l feel sick.
-What is it?

445
00:28:45,577 --> 00:28:49,707
l`m still shaking.
l`ve been shaking like this for days.

446
00:28:49,914 --> 00:28:52,007
What`s wrong?

447
00:28:53,785 --> 00:28:58,722
l`ve been going out with this man
l met through the personal columns.

448
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:03,488
Very attractive, He`s very nice,

449
00:29:04,195 --> 00:29:07,756
I went out with him three times,
He was never fresh,

450
00:29:07,966 --> 00:29:10,958
He was always a perfect gentleman,

451
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:25,916
So we both came back here,,,

452
00:29:26,117 --> 00:29:31,111
,,,and Jenny was away, She was
sleeping over at a friend`s house,

453
00:29:31,322 --> 00:29:34,314
It was 1,`00 in the morning
or something,,,

454
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:37,620
,,,and we both had had
a little to drink,

455
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:40,764
-l wanna tie you to the bed.
-Really?

456
00:29:40,965 --> 00:29:43,866
And rip your dress off.

457
00:29:44,636 --> 00:29:49,471
Have you ever been bound up,
tied up and made love to?

458
00:29:49,674 --> 00:29:52,199
l`m, uh-- l`m a--

459
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,878
l`m a sensible gal.

460
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:57,738
No more, you`re not.

461
00:29:58,983 --> 00:30:01,451
God, Murray. God....

462
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:05,930
Barbara, l`m shocked at this!
You`re my sister.

463
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:10,665
You`re this nice middle-class mother.
What are you telling me?

464
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:15,209
l couldn`t move.
l was tied tightly to the bedposts.

465
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:18,849
Oh, Jesus, by a strang--
A guy you didn`t know.

466
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,315
Now you`re gonna tell me
that he robbed you.

467
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,748
No.

468
00:30:24,688 --> 00:30:27,623
He got on top of me and--

469
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:31,959
-And what?
-l can`t say it. l just can`t say it.

470
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,189
What? Tell me.
What`s so terrible?

471
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:39,927
He sat over me
and went to the bathroom.

472
00:30:41,972 --> 00:30:43,769
That`s so disgusting!

473
00:30:43,974 --> 00:30:47,273
Oh, my God! That`s the worst
thing l ever heard!

474
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:52,142
-Then he took his clothes and left.
-Barbara, you idiot!

475
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:55,318
He could`ve cut your throat,
murdered you.

476
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:58,420
-l`d have preferred it.
-You`re such a dope!

477
00:30:58,622 --> 00:31:01,420
l wish l could have sympathy for this.

478
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:04,924
That`s easy for you to say,
but l`m so lonely.

479
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:08,530
You don`t know what it`s like
to be by yourself.

480
00:31:08,732 --> 00:31:11,223
l`m sure you`re lonely.
lt`s painful...

481
00:31:11,435 --> 00:31:14,598
...but promise me you`ll never
place another ad.

482
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:19,037
-lt`s ridiculous!
-My whole life is passing me by...

483
00:31:19,243 --> 00:31:24,146
...l don`t have anyone to love. l know
that`s hard for you to comprehend...

484
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:27,909
...because you`re married.
But it`s lonely out there.

485
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:32,078
You have a wife.
You love her, and that`s so nice.

486
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:35,747
Things are not so good
between my wife and myself.

487
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,954
Don`t get any illusions. We`ve been
coming apart for the last year.

488
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:46,501
Neither of us has energy to do
anything about it, but it`s not great.

489
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:06,153
A strange man defecated on my sister.

490
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:08,655
Why?

491
00:32:11,295 --> 00:32:12,887
l don`t know.

492
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:18,433
ls there any reason l could give you
that would answer that satisfactorily?

493
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,931
You know, it`s just so--

494
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:23,206
Human sexuality is just...

495
00:32:23,407 --> 00:32:27,901
...it`s so mysterious.
Which, l guess, is--

496
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,672
l guess it`s good, in a way.

497
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:34,985
Yeah, well, l gotta be up at 7.

498
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:50,096
lt had to be a dark secret
for you to stoop to call me...

499
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,768
...to invite me here.

500
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:55,700
Jack, don`t hit me while l`m down.
You`re my brother.

501
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:58,170
-l was there for you.
-l`m here.

502
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:01,173
Don`t make sharp cracks.
l didn`t stoop.

503
00:33:01,378 --> 00:33:03,005
l`m in serious trouble.

504
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:06,012
She won`t take money
or listen to reason.

505
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:11,120
l considered telling Miriam, but
she`d never be able to live with it.

506
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,985
She`s also blabbing about my
financial indiscretions.

507
00:33:15,192 --> 00:33:18,423
Not that l stole,
but l was indiscreet.

508
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:21,325
lf they look, they might find things.

509
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:25,798
-What would you like me to do?
-l don`t know, she`s killing me.

510
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:29,666
-Want me to have somebody talk to her?
-Like what?

511
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:31,500
Straighten her out.

512
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,312
You mean threaten her?
That`s all l need.

513
00:33:35,512 --> 00:33:39,278
-How else do you keep her quiet?
-l don`t know.

514
00:33:39,483 --> 00:33:41,348
Jack, l don`t know.

515
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:43,542
Well....

516
00:33:44,388 --> 00:33:46,879
Christ, Jack, what do you suggest?

517
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,451
What did you call me for?

518
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,597
l hoped you`d have more experience
with something like this.

519
00:33:55,399 --> 00:34:00,268
You called me to do some dirty work.
That`s all you ever call for.

520
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:04,633
Look how bitter you are.

521
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:10,203
You`ve staked me plenty of times.
l don`t forget my obligations.

522
00:34:10,414 --> 00:34:13,383
Threatening her would
only make it worse.

523
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:16,678
Forget about it.
What do you want me to say?

524
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:20,721
How can l forget about it?
l`m fighting for my life.

525
00:34:20,924 --> 00:34:23,916
She will destroy
everything l`ve built.

526
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:29,191
That`s what l`m saying. lf she won`t
listen to reason, take the next step.

527
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,860
-Threats, violence, what can we do?
-She can be gotten rid of.

528
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:39,407
-l know many people who can be bought.
-l`m not going to comment on that.

529
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:41,904
Well, what did you want me to do?

530
00:34:42,112 --> 00:34:45,570
Not to do dirty work,
despite what you think.

531
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:50,553
Anyway, it`s gone beyond
just Miriam now.

532
00:34:50,754 --> 00:34:53,917
She`s talking financial doings.

533
00:34:54,758 --> 00:34:59,889
l`m out of ideas. l don`t know
what l expected from you.

534
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:05,433
You don`t know what goes on in this
world sitting here with four acres...

535
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:08,797
...and your country club
and your rich friends.

536
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:12,339
Out there in the real world,
it`s very different.

537
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,774
-l`ve met a lot of characters--
-l know you have.

538
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:18,504
From 7th Avenue, from Atlantic City.

539
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:21,446
l`m not like you, l look at reality.

540
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,712
l can`t afford to be aloof.

541
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:29,518
You come to me with a big problem,
then you get highhanded on me.

542
00:35:30,527 --> 00:35:34,258
l don`t mean to be highhanded.
l`m irritable, okay?

543
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,298
Okay, forget l said anything.

544
00:35:41,238 --> 00:35:44,105
Let me just get
something straight here.

545
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,970
Am l understanding you right?

546
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:52,144
Are you suggesting getting rid of her?

547
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:57,211
You won`t be involved,
but l`ll need some cash.

548
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:06,094
-What will they do?
-What will they do? They`ll handle it.

549
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:13,433
l`m talking about a human being.
She`s not an insect.

550
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:15,867
You don`t just step on her.

551
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:20,571
l know. Playing hardball
was never your game.

552
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,178
You never get your hands dirty.

553
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:28,716
Apparently, this woman is for real.
This thing isn`t just gonna go away.

554
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,117
l can`t do it.

555
00:36:33,924 --> 00:36:36,051
l can`t think that way.

556
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,996
I don`t want to know anything,

557
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:53,768
This is a work of art,
The ropes come off,

558
00:36:53,977 --> 00:36:58,311
-I tie weights to her with catgut,
-That`s a horrible word!

559
00:36:58,515 --> 00:37:02,747
Get the angle on this,
She disappears two weeks, maybe three,

560
00:37:02,953 --> 00:37:07,694
Then up she pops, none of this
stuff on her, No marks, A suicide,

561
00:37:07,927 --> 00:37:13,229
-Now, isn`t that beautiful?
-It`s loathsome, Be sure no one sees,

562
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:16,368
This only happens in the movies.

563
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:20,471
We should get back.
Lester`s gonna leave the hotel soon.

564
00:37:20,673 --> 00:37:25,872
lt`s okay. l`ve been shooting
him all week. l`m tired of it.

565
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,413
l shouldn`t have told you
my weakness is going to matinees.

566
00:37:30,617 --> 00:37:34,713
l go all the time with my niece.
lt`s like playing hooky.

567
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:37,185
We were late yesterday too.

568
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,188
We weren`t late.
We didn`t miss anything.

569
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:44,454
Have another cheeseburger.
lt`s our lunch hour.

570
00:37:44,664 --> 00:37:48,691
l got everyone at the network
excited over Professor Levy.

571
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:51,666
l have great stuff to show you later.

572
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:53,429
Listen...

573
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,165
...l brought you a present.

574
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:01,010
Great. Now l can get rid of
my few remaining teeth.

575
00:38:08,488 --> 00:38:10,956
-Look at his face.
-A treadmill.

576
00:38:11,157 --> 00:38:15,059
-You telling me something?
-You were bored with the bicycle.

577
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:16,728
lt`s just as boring.

578
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:19,660
-You`re in great shape.
-For a man my age.

579
00:38:19,866 --> 00:38:23,199
-That`s exactly what l was gonna say.
-Thank you.

580
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:27,562
This thing`s great
for relieving tension.

581
00:38:27,941 --> 00:38:33,140
-lt`s just like the one at the club.
-Where are we gonna put this?

582
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:36,144
l`ll have some 20 men
take it upstairs.

583
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:41,184
-lt looks like kinetic sculpture.
-lt`s not staying down here.

584
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:45,287
Dad, it`s for you. A Miss Paley.

585
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:48,692
-She`s a patient.
-On this phone?

586
00:38:49,362 --> 00:38:52,559
Yeah, she`s going through a crisis.

587
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:56,360
-Can`t the service take it?
-lt`s probably urgent.

588
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:00,599
l`m at the gas station
down the road from your house.

589
00:39:00,807 --> 00:39:03,207
l can be there in five minutes.

590
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:08,005
l`m going to,
unless you meet me right now.

591
00:39:08,214 --> 00:39:09,977
No, Judah.

592
00:39:10,216 --> 00:39:11,911
No, Judah.

593
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:17,881
No. l wanna talk to you in person,
or l`m coming over.

594
00:39:34,507 --> 00:39:37,408
-Calm down, okay?
-You said we`re going away.

595
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:40,272
l want us to be alone.
When we get back...

596
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,779
...l want you to end it with Miriam.

597
00:39:43,983 --> 00:39:46,918
l can`t go on like this
and wait forever!

598
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,419
-You don`t know what it`s like!
-Talk to somebody.

599
00:39:50,623 --> 00:39:54,081
-Like a therapist or somebody.
-Don`t trick me!

600
00:39:54,294 --> 00:39:56,353
Christ, l`m shaking.

601
00:39:58,598 --> 00:39:59,826
Listen...

602
00:40:01,134 --> 00:40:03,694
...l brought you a birthday present.

603
00:40:04,137 --> 00:40:07,038
l know how much you love Schubert.

604
00:40:19,886 --> 00:40:23,287
Sometimes, when there`s real love,,,

605
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:26,014
,,,and true acknowledgment
of a mistake,,,

606
00:40:26,225 --> 00:40:28,386
,,, there can be forgiveness too,

607
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:30,720
I know Miriam,

608
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,696
Her values, her feelings,
her place among our friends,

609
00:40:34,901 --> 00:40:38,302
What choice do you have
if the woman`s gonna tell?

610
00:40:38,504 --> 00:40:42,702
You have to confess the wrong
and hope for understanding,

611
00:40:42,909 --> 00:40:45,639
I couldn`t go on living
if I didn`t feel,,,

612
00:40:45,845 --> 00:40:48,370
,,,a moral structure
with real meaning,,,

613
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:52,347
,,,and forgiveness
and some higher power,

614
00:40:52,552 --> 00:40:55,953
Otherwise, there`s no basis
to know how to live,

615
00:40:56,155 --> 00:40:58,646
And I know a spark of that notion,,,

616
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:01,088
,,,is inside you somewhere too,

617
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:09,367
Could you really go through with it?

618
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:14,303
What choice do l have, man?

619
00:41:14,574 --> 00:41:16,041
Tell me.

620
00:41:16,943 --> 00:41:20,435
Give the people you`ve hurt
a chance to forgive you.

621
00:41:20,947 --> 00:41:23,142
Miriam won`t forgive me.

622
00:41:23,449 --> 00:41:25,246
She`ll be broken.

623
00:41:25,618 --> 00:41:27,586
She worships me.

624
00:41:28,221 --> 00:41:33,124
She`ll be humiliated before everyone.
This woman plans to make a stink.

625
00:41:34,394 --> 00:41:37,693
-Did you make promises to her?
-No.

626
00:41:38,564 --> 00:41:41,556
Maybe l led her on
more than l realized.

627
00:41:41,768 --> 00:41:44,293
She`s so emotionally hungry.

628
00:41:44,771 --> 00:41:49,367
-But it`s deeper than just Miriam.
-Meaning financial improprieties?

629
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:51,006
No.

630
00:41:52,211 --> 00:41:53,838
Maybe l--

631
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,340
Maybe l did make
some questionable moves.

632
00:42:01,354 --> 00:42:03,652
Only you would know that, Judah.

633
00:42:03,923 --> 00:42:06,118
l don`t anymore, Ben.

634
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,789
Sometimes it`s worse than--
Worse than jail.

635
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:14,192
lt`s a human life.

636
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:17,596
You don`t think God sees?

637
00:42:19,505 --> 00:42:24,568
-God is a luxury l can`t afford.
-Now you`re talking like your brother.

638
00:42:26,045 --> 00:42:28,411
Jack lives in the real world.

639
00:42:28,614 --> 00:42:31,174
You live in the kingdom of heaven.

640
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:35,479
l managed to keep free
of that real world...

641
00:42:35,688 --> 00:42:38,088
...but suddenly, it`s found me.

642
00:42:38,624 --> 00:42:42,754
You fool around with her,
then when you think it`s enough...

643
00:42:42,962 --> 00:42:45,396
...you wanna sweep her under the rug?

644
00:42:46,165 --> 00:42:49,328
There`s no other solution but Jack`s.

645
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:53,338
l push one button
and l can sleep again nights.

646
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:55,439
Could you sleep with that?

647
00:42:56,943 --> 00:42:59,104
ls that who you really are?

648
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,611
l will not be destroyed
by this neurotic woman.

649
00:43:06,452 --> 00:43:08,511
But the law.

650
00:43:10,022 --> 00:43:12,855
Without the law, it`s all darkness.

651
00:43:14,727 --> 00:43:16,854
You sound like my father.

652
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:21,924
What good is the law if it
prevents me from receiving justice?

653
00:43:22,735 --> 00:43:26,899
ls what she`s doing to me just?
ls this what l deserve?

654
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:42,087
Jack? lt`s Judah.

655
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:46,717
We should move ahead
with what we discussed.

656
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:50,262
How much will you need?

657
00:44:12,065 --> 00:44:13,862
lt`s not funny, guys.

658
00:44:14,067 --> 00:44:17,969
You`re not thinking funny.
You gotta think with your ear.

659
00:44:18,171 --> 00:44:22,301
Do you understand?
Here`s the difference. lt`s very easy.

660
00:44:22,509 --> 00:44:27,412
lf it bends, it`s funny.
lf it breaks, it`s not funny.

661
00:44:27,614 --> 00:44:32,210
lt`s very simple. Wait a minute.
Jeff, this is Alva.

662
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,946
-Hi, pleased to meet you.
-Don`t shoot this part.

663
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:40,489
Alva`s in the new series.
l don`t know what part...

664
00:44:40,694 --> 00:44:44,528
...l just know l want her.
lt`s wonderful. You look great.

665
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:47,996
Trust me, they love you. Be right out.

666
00:44:48,735 --> 00:44:51,795
Don`t do that while we`re shooting.

667
00:44:52,005 --> 00:44:55,736
Do you understand?
Think of Oedipus. Oedipus is funny.

668
00:44:55,942 --> 00:44:58,103
That`s the structure of funny.

669
00:44:58,311 --> 00:45:03,374
``Who did this terrible thing?
My God, it was me.`` That`s funny--

670
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:06,984
Don`t do it, they`re shooting!
What are you doing?

671
00:45:08,621 --> 00:45:13,422
You will notice
that what we are aiming at,,,

672
00:45:13,827 --> 00:45:17,593
,,,when we fall in love
is a very strange paradox,

673
00:45:17,797 --> 00:45:22,166
The paradox consists of the fact
that when we fall in love,,,

674
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:25,861
,,,we are seeking to re-find,,,

675
00:45:26,072 --> 00:45:28,472
,,,all or some of the people,,,

676
00:45:28,675 --> 00:45:31,371
,,, to whom we were attached
as children,

677
00:45:31,578 --> 00:45:35,207
On the other hand,
we ask our beloved,,,

678
00:45:35,415 --> 00:45:38,578
,,, to correct all of the wrongs,,,

679
00:45:38,785 --> 00:45:44,087
,,, that these early parents
or siblings inflicted upon us,

680
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:47,350
So love contains
in it the contradiction,,,

681
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,188
,,, the attempt to return
to the past,,,

682
00:45:50,397 --> 00:45:53,855
,,,and the attempt to undo the past,

683
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:57,701
See? No limos, no bimbos,
no awards or anything.

684
00:45:57,904 --> 00:46:03,137
-This guy is a thinker, an intellect.
-When you ultimately show this...

685
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:08,576
...to the people that make the
decision, emphasize his view of life.

686
00:46:08,782 --> 00:46:13,549
-lt`s life-affirming. They`d love it.
-This is what l need.

687
00:46:13,753 --> 00:46:18,918
A little interest in my work,
a little encouragement or something.

688
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:23,027
l got a bottle of champagne
as a prize from Paris.

689
00:46:23,229 --> 00:46:28,030
l got honorable mention
for a documentary l did on leukemia.

690
00:46:28,234 --> 00:46:32,898
-Want some champagne?
-l never say no to champagne or caviar.

691
00:46:33,106 --> 00:46:38,237
Perfect, l have no caviar. l have
oat bran. lt`s better for your heart.

692
00:46:40,814 --> 00:46:44,306
He was very eloquent
on the subject of love.

693
00:46:44,517 --> 00:46:47,748
Yeah. Wish l had read him
before l got married.

694
00:46:47,954 --> 00:46:51,651
-lt would`ve saved my gall bladder.
-What did you say?

695
00:46:51,858 --> 00:46:56,659
Nothing. He wrote an interesting
book on human relationships.

696
00:46:56,863 --> 00:47:00,060
He speaks very highly
of love at first sight.

697
00:47:00,266 --> 00:47:03,292
l fell for my ex-husband
at first sight.

698
00:47:03,503 --> 00:47:05,869
l should`ve taken a second look.

699
00:47:06,072 --> 00:47:09,166
Actually, it was my fault
as much as his.

700
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:12,344
You still wear a wedding ring.
Why is that?

701
00:47:12,545 --> 00:47:17,278
Well, l guess l`m just
not ready to take it off.

702
00:47:17,617 --> 00:47:21,178
lt`s good. lt keeps me
from getting asked out.

703
00:47:21,387 --> 00:47:25,187
You must have had a terrible
marriage to avoid dating.

704
00:47:25,391 --> 00:47:30,090
Well, no. He was great,
very brilliant. He`s an architect.

705
00:47:30,296 --> 00:47:32,924
But if you`re gonna have an affair...

706
00:47:33,132 --> 00:47:36,761
...not with my best friend,
in my four-poster bed.

707
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:40,406
And they didn`t have
to finish my pistachio nuts.

708
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:45,010
That inconsiderate? l hope it
hasn`t soured you on marriage.

709
00:47:45,211 --> 00:47:49,705
-l hear myself sounding like a bore.
-Just the opposite. Hello.

710
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:52,714
Yeah, she`s here. How did you know?

711
00:47:53,286 --> 00:47:54,947
Hold on one second.

712
00:47:55,154 --> 00:47:56,815
lt`s Lester.

713
00:47:58,157 --> 00:47:59,624
Hello.

714
00:47:59,826 --> 00:48:01,418
Yeah?

715
00:48:01,828 --> 00:48:04,353
Sure, if you want me to.

716
00:48:04,898 --> 00:48:07,332
Okay. At the office at what time?

717
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:11,527
-9? That`s no problem.
-9:00? The building will be dark.

718
00:48:11,738 --> 00:48:14,673
-Nobody`s at the office.
-l didn`t hear you.

719
00:48:14,874 --> 00:48:17,502
You`ll be in a dark room with Lester.

720
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:21,237
-The office is a spooky place at 9:00.
-Definitely.

721
00:48:21,447 --> 00:48:25,349
-Sure, the hotel is even nearer.
-Don`t go to the hotel.

722
00:48:25,552 --> 00:48:30,717
What was that? Room 1 91 1 .
Sure. Okay, l`ll see you there.

723
00:48:30,924 --> 00:48:34,018
-You`re not going to his hotel.
-What`s wrong?

724
00:48:34,227 --> 00:48:38,857
-l better go with you. l know him.
-Don`t be ridiculous.

725
00:48:39,065 --> 00:48:43,195
He`ll read you your Miranda rights
and tear your clothes off.

726
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:46,099
He wants to produce something of mine.

727
00:48:46,306 --> 00:48:47,739
Your first child.

728
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:51,399
l can`t be with a guy
who wears shoes and no socks.

729
00:48:51,611 --> 00:48:55,547
-Much less one who says ``nucular.``
-He also says ``foilage.``

730
00:48:55,748 --> 00:48:59,013
You have a copy
of Singing in the Rain?

731
00:48:59,218 --> 00:49:03,245
lt`s the one print l own.
lt`s a very good 1 6mm print.

732
00:49:03,456 --> 00:49:06,619
l play it now and then
to cheer myself up.

733
00:49:06,826 --> 00:49:10,353
l saw it years ago.
l remember loving it.

734
00:49:10,563 --> 00:49:13,657
They play it on television frequently.

735
00:49:13,866 --> 00:49:16,926
-You wanna watch it? l can play it.
-Really?

736
00:49:17,136 --> 00:49:19,832
-You wanna have dinner?
-Aren`t you busy?

737
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:24,237
No, and you`ve got till 9:00.
l-- You know, why not?

738
00:49:24,444 --> 00:49:28,608
There`s an lndian restaurant,
l`ll send out. You know, we could...

739
00:49:28,982 --> 00:49:30,142
...you know....

740
00:49:38,758 --> 00:49:41,124
l love this lndian food.

741
00:49:41,327 --> 00:49:45,787
lt`s great. Want some more
tandoori mouse? Just kidding.

742
00:49:45,999 --> 00:49:50,129
-You want some of the curry?
-No, too hot.

743
00:49:50,336 --> 00:49:52,736
My teeth are melting.

744
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,508
Boy, this is the perfect way
to see this movie.

745
00:49:58,211 --> 00:50:00,042
lt`s great, isn`t it?

746
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,505
When you see Lester later...

747
00:50:02,715 --> 00:50:07,948
...be careful. Because this guy tells
you he wants to exchange ideas.

748
00:50:08,154 --> 00:50:10,936
What he wants is to exchange fluids.

749
00:52:04,549 --> 00:52:08,349
-Yes?
-l have a delivery of some flowers.

750
00:52:08,553 --> 00:52:11,647
Chris and you can`t agree
on your honeymoon.

751
00:52:11,857 --> 00:52:15,020
-We can agree on something.
-We don`t disagree.

752
00:52:15,227 --> 00:52:17,923
lt`s just that l told Chris...

753
00:52:18,129 --> 00:52:21,621
...l wanna go someplace warm
that has beaches.

754
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:25,325
But l also want to do
things like, maybe, hike.

755
00:52:25,804 --> 00:52:28,932
-l hadn`t thought of Australia.
-No, not there.

756
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:33,304
We should go where we wanted
to go in the first place.

757
00:52:33,512 --> 00:52:37,812
-Where did you want to go?
-We wanted to go to ltaly.

758
00:52:38,016 --> 00:52:39,813
Dad, it`s Jack.

759
00:52:40,252 --> 00:52:42,652
-He`s on the phone.
-Who?

760
00:52:43,355 --> 00:52:46,119
-Jack.
-l thought we had it decided.

761
00:52:46,324 --> 00:52:47,848
ltaly is wonderful.

762
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:52,496
Right. We can have sun.
We can have snow, anything.

763
00:52:53,098 --> 00:52:55,862
A lot of my friends
have gone to ltaly.

764
00:52:56,067 --> 00:52:58,763
You won`t go there because of that?

765
00:52:59,004 --> 00:53:02,940
Everything came out fine.
lt`s over and done with.

766
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:05,473
No problems. Forget about it.

767
00:53:05,977 --> 00:53:07,706
Oh, my God.

768
00:53:08,914 --> 00:53:10,677
Oh, my God.

769
00:53:10,982 --> 00:53:13,109
l`m in shock, Jack.

770
00:53:13,652 --> 00:53:17,679
l`m telling you, it`s like
the whole thing never existed.

771
00:53:17,889 --> 00:53:21,450
lt`s a small burglary, nothing more.

772
00:53:22,027 --> 00:53:25,986
So go on back to your life,
and put it behind you.

773
00:53:27,532 --> 00:53:29,261
l can`t speak.

774
00:53:30,201 --> 00:53:31,725
l need a drink.

775
00:53:31,937 --> 00:53:33,165
Jack....

776
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,032
What am l gonna do?
l`ve got guests here now.

777
00:53:46,117 --> 00:53:48,449
God have mercy on us.

778
00:54:30,219 --> 00:54:34,178
-Mom, you said Mary had acupuncture.
-She`s tried it.

779
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:38,326
-She`s been going for a few months.
-She hasn`t gone back.

780
00:54:38,527 --> 00:54:42,520
ls everything okay, sweetheart?
You look kind of upset.

781
00:54:42,731 --> 00:54:45,097
Yeah, l`m fine. lt`s just Jack.

782
00:54:45,434 --> 00:54:49,063
She`s still wearing that collar
when she drives.

783
00:54:49,271 --> 00:54:51,569
Well, sometimes it does work.

784
00:54:52,341 --> 00:54:55,242
We were talking about
Oriental medicine.

785
00:54:55,444 --> 00:54:59,847
A friend consulted a Chinese physician
with an eye problem.

786
00:55:00,049 --> 00:55:03,109
He inserted a cat whisker
into her tear duct.

787
00:55:03,319 --> 00:55:07,119
She`s been telling the story
all week. lt`s her favorite.

788
00:55:07,323 --> 00:55:09,154
-What happened?
-lt cured her.

789
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:13,488
-lt did.
-You told me he uses wires too.

790
00:55:13,696 --> 00:55:14,685
Why would you--?

791
00:55:14,897 --> 00:55:18,025
-ln acupuncture, you use needles.
-But very fine.

792
00:55:18,234 --> 00:55:22,170
-But that`s a different procedure.
-What do you think?

793
00:55:25,474 --> 00:55:27,533
Judah, what do you think?

794
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:31,907
l think l`ve done a terrible thing.

795
00:55:32,381 --> 00:55:34,110
What`s wrong, honey?

796
00:55:35,451 --> 00:55:38,682
l left these papers at the office...

797
00:55:38,888 --> 00:55:41,448
...which l absolutely need tonight.

798
00:55:41,657 --> 00:55:45,855
l can`t believe l did this.
How negligent of me.

799
00:55:46,061 --> 00:55:48,586
l have a conference in the morning.

800
00:55:48,797 --> 00:55:53,291
-You`re not going tonight.
-l must. l have an hour`s work to do.

801
00:55:53,502 --> 00:55:56,130
-But we`re having a party.
-l`m so sorry.

802
00:55:56,338 --> 00:55:59,830
-Please forgive me. l--
-Don`t apologize.

803
00:56:00,042 --> 00:56:02,602
l don`t like him driving at night.

804
00:56:02,811 --> 00:56:07,145
-Stanley, l`m so sorry about this.
-Chris, would you go with him?

805
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:09,715
-Would you like some company?
-No.

806
00:56:09,919 --> 00:56:12,444
Darling, forgive me. l must go.

807
00:56:12,655 --> 00:56:15,123
lt was a wonderful evening.

808
00:56:15,324 --> 00:56:17,952
lf you`re here when l get back--

809
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,721
-Don`t worry about us.
-l couldn`t apologize more.

810
00:56:21,931 --> 00:56:24,559
Let`s just finish the coffee.
Sit down.

811
00:56:24,767 --> 00:56:26,166
He`ll be back.

812
00:58:37,166 --> 00:58:38,861
I`ll say it once again,

813
00:58:39,535 --> 00:58:42,527
The eyes of God see all.

814
00:58:43,172 --> 00:58:47,734
Listen, Judah. There is absolutely
nothing that escapes his sight.

815
00:58:47,943 --> 00:58:50,935
He sees the righteous and the wicked.

816
00:58:51,146 --> 00:58:53,706
And the righteous will be rewarded...

817
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:58,478
...but the wicked will be
punished for eternity.

818
01:00:22,538 --> 01:00:23,766
Hello?

819
01:01:02,411 --> 01:01:06,142
l want your opinion.
l`m doing a special show on jazz.

820
01:01:06,348 --> 01:01:08,339
l admire her opinion so.

821
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:12,179
Did you tell them l want
to produce an idea you have?

822
01:01:12,387 --> 01:01:16,118
She wants to do a different
Chekhov story every month.

823
01:01:16,325 --> 01:01:18,759
-He wrote a million.
-That`s sweet.

824
01:01:18,961 --> 01:01:22,795
-l`m putty in your hands.
-What will l do with putty?

825
01:01:22,998 --> 01:01:26,695
She`s always got a zinger.
This vixen, this minx.

826
01:01:26,902 --> 01:01:31,396
We should really be going.
We have to pick up those airsick bags.

827
01:01:31,607 --> 01:01:36,909
l gotta get up to teach Emily Dickinson
to upper middle-class crack addicts.

828
01:01:37,112 --> 01:01:38,315
-One of my favorite poets.
-Me too.

829
01:01:38,315 --> 01:01:39,475
-One of my favorite poets.
-Me too.

830
01:01:39,683 --> 01:01:43,585
-``Because l could not stop for death.``
-``He kindly stopped for me.``

831
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:45,379
The word ``kindly,`` right?

832
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:49,252
``The carriage held but just ourselves
and immortality.``

833
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:51,689
``We slowly drove, he knew no haste.``

834
01:01:51,895 --> 01:01:54,261
``l had put away
my labor, and my leisure too...``

835
01:01:54,464 --> 01:01:55,556
``...for his civility.``

836
01:01:55,766 --> 01:01:59,566
-He was a great English student.
-Not that l graduated.

837
01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:03,672
l couldn`t graduate, but now
my school teaches a class in...

838
01:02:03,874 --> 01:02:07,640
-...existential motifs in my sitcoms.
-Really?

839
01:02:08,445 --> 01:02:10,538
-Where did you study?
-Columbia.

840
01:02:10,747 --> 01:02:13,682
Columbia? What did you major in?

841
01:02:13,884 --> 01:02:16,444
Law. l graduated from the law school.

842
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:21,090
-You didn`t practice?
-l did. But then l met my husband.

843
01:02:21,291 --> 01:02:26,228
We moved to Europe for a while.
lt`s a long, boring story.

844
01:02:26,429 --> 01:02:28,863
l wish you`d go back to your job.

845
01:02:29,065 --> 01:02:33,593
l used to edit newsreel footage.
Floods, fires and famines.

846
01:02:33,804 --> 01:02:34,793
Depressing.

847
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:38,168
-We don`t all have to go.
-No. l do.

848
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:41,606
We`ll go. You two stay
and talk business.

849
01:02:41,812 --> 01:02:44,645
-l could go too, if you`d like.
-Let`s go.

850
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:48,113
-Let`s go for a drink.
-l wouldn`t mind.

851
01:02:48,318 --> 01:02:51,617
-l`m just exhausted.
-From what? lt`s early.

852
01:02:51,822 --> 01:02:53,016
Some other time.

853
01:02:53,223 --> 01:02:56,420
-One little drink.
-Really. Some other time.

854
01:02:58,028 --> 01:02:59,962
Lester was so pushy tonight.

855
01:03:00,163 --> 01:03:03,826
He says it`s business with Halley,
but he`s after her.

856
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:08,767
-She really likes him. l can tell.
-You`re kidding. She likes him?

857
01:03:08,972 --> 01:03:12,931
What`s not to like?
He`s attractive, rich, charming.

858
01:03:13,143 --> 01:03:16,579
You`re prejudiced.
She put him down pretty good.

859
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:20,272
He said, ``One drink.``
She said, ``Some other time.``

860
01:03:20,483 --> 01:03:22,747
l loved that. Socked it to him.

861
01:03:22,953 --> 01:03:26,047
-Fine. Enough.
-That was pretty witty.

862
01:03:26,256 --> 01:03:31,023
-How can you say she likes him?
-She was staring at him all night.

863
01:03:31,228 --> 01:03:36,291
-She probably can`t believe her eyes.
-You wouldn`t pick up on those things.

864
01:03:36,499 --> 01:03:39,195
You`re not the least bit romantic.

865
01:03:39,402 --> 01:03:42,633
You`re the one who stopped
sleeping with me.

866
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:47,037
lt`ll be a year on April 20th.
Same date as Hitler`s birthday.

867
01:03:47,244 --> 01:03:49,906
l`m not discussing that anymore.

868
01:03:50,113 --> 01:03:52,946
l`ll bet you she`s with him now.

869
01:03:53,149 --> 01:03:56,050
For how much?
l`m serious. For how much?

870
01:03:56,253 --> 01:03:58,915
You really know how to get my goat.

871
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:26,374
Hi. lt`s Clifford.

872
01:04:26,683 --> 01:04:29,516
Yes. l knew you`d be in.

873
01:04:30,287 --> 01:04:33,814
Tonight was a lot of fun.
Wasn`t Lester so silly?

874
01:04:34,024 --> 01:04:37,460
He`s so self-important.
He was pushing all night.

875
01:04:37,661 --> 01:04:40,186
l was frankly embarrassed for him.

876
01:04:43,833 --> 01:04:45,994
What is he doing there?

877
01:04:49,005 --> 01:04:52,065
You`re talking business at midnight?

878
01:04:54,811 --> 01:04:58,838
That could be very dangerous.
You want me to come over?

879
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:05,515
Okay, if you can handle it.

880
01:05:06,923 --> 01:05:09,756
Okay. l`ll see you tomorrow.

881
01:05:18,635 --> 01:05:20,330
l`m in love with Halley.

882
01:05:20,537 --> 01:05:23,267
Lester is making his move.
l can see it.

883
01:05:23,473 --> 01:05:25,873
He wants her just for a conquest.

884
01:05:26,076 --> 01:05:28,874
lt`s so shallow,
and l`m crazy about her.

885
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:32,446
l can`t compete with a guy
who`s rich and famous.

886
01:05:32,649 --> 01:05:37,018
-He`s no competition for you.
-God bless you for saying that.

887
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:39,085
But you`ll find out...

888
01:05:39,289 --> 01:05:44,226
...that great depth and smoldering
sensuality doesn`t always win.

889
01:05:44,527 --> 01:05:47,087
You know his brother Ben the rabbi?

890
01:05:47,297 --> 01:05:50,425
He`s a wonderful guy.
He`s going blind.

891
01:05:50,633 --> 01:05:55,195
He`s got a terrible eye disease.
He`ll be blind in a few months.

892
01:05:55,405 --> 01:05:58,533
He has a great attitude.
He`s really a mensch.

893
01:05:59,776 --> 01:06:01,505
All right. Look left.

894
01:06:02,645 --> 01:06:04,636
Now straight ahead, Ben.

895
01:06:06,883 --> 01:06:08,350
Now to the right.

896
01:06:09,352 --> 01:06:10,614
That`s good.

897
01:06:18,595 --> 01:06:19,619
My mother said,,,

898
01:06:21,164 --> 01:06:23,598
...that l should go to the doctor.

899
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:26,725
Because my eyes weren`t so good.

900
01:06:26,936 --> 01:06:29,427
Well, you`re an ophthalmologist.

901
01:06:29,639 --> 01:06:32,972
Do you agree the eyes
are the windows of the soul?

902
01:06:33,176 --> 01:06:37,237
l believe they`re windows.
l`m not sure they see the soul.

903
01:06:37,447 --> 01:06:40,007
My mother taught me l have a soul.

904
01:06:40,216 --> 01:06:43,151
And it will live on after l`m gone.

905
01:06:43,353 --> 01:06:47,949
lf you look deeply enough in my eyes,
you can see it.

906
01:06:52,162 --> 01:06:54,062
So, what`s the verdict?

907
01:06:54,697 --> 01:06:58,292
l want to resolve this
before my daughter`s wedding.

908
01:06:59,736 --> 01:07:03,695
-Julie`s getting married?
-Time passes quickly, doesn`t it?

909
01:07:03,907 --> 01:07:07,206
Remember she was just a baby?
Well, yours too.

910
01:07:10,613 --> 01:07:13,912
Are you okay, Judah?
You don`t look so good.

911
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:17,348
l just haven`t been
sleeping that well.

912
01:07:17,921 --> 01:07:20,116
Tell me, if l`m not prying...

913
01:07:20,323 --> 01:07:23,724
...did you ever resolve
your personal difficulties?

914
01:07:24,594 --> 01:07:29,429
Yes, actually. lt resolved itself.
The woman listened to reason.

915
01:07:29,632 --> 01:07:31,065
Did she?

916
01:07:31,768 --> 01:07:34,532
That`s wonderful. So you got a break.

917
01:07:34,871 --> 01:07:39,331
Sometimes, to have a little good luck
is the most brilliant plan.

918
01:07:39,676 --> 01:07:43,612
Relax. You`re white.
You`re gonna have a breakdown.

919
01:07:43,813 --> 01:07:48,011
You expect me to be my old self?
l jump when the phone rings.

920
01:07:48,785 --> 01:07:52,881
-No good can come of this.
-l kept you uninvolved.

921
01:07:53,089 --> 01:07:56,547
The guy who`s responsible
is back in New Orleans.

922
01:07:56,759 --> 01:07:58,727
lt`s pure evil, Jack.

923
01:07:59,229 --> 01:08:03,188
A man kills for money.
He doesn`t even know his victims.

924
01:08:03,399 --> 01:08:06,698
He kills, you pay him
and he kills again.

925
01:08:06,903 --> 01:08:09,064
What was your alternative?

926
01:08:09,772 --> 01:08:11,967
How did l get in so deep?

927
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:15,637
What dream was l following?

928
01:08:16,312 --> 01:08:20,942
You said it yourself a million times,
``You only go around once.``

929
01:08:22,118 --> 01:08:24,609
l went to her place after.

930
01:08:24,821 --> 01:08:27,813
l had to retrieve
some incriminating things.

931
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:30,315
l saw her there.

932
01:08:31,394 --> 01:08:32,918
Just staring up...

933
01:08:33,129 --> 01:08:35,097
...an inert object.

934
01:08:36,266 --> 01:08:38,826
There was nothing behind her eyes.

935
01:08:39,035 --> 01:08:41,833
lf you looked into them,
all you saw was...

936
01:08:42,605 --> 01:08:44,470
...a black void.

937
01:09:20,887 --> 01:09:22,377
Can l help you?

938
01:09:24,924 --> 01:09:27,518
l used to live in this house once.

939
01:09:27,727 --> 01:09:29,991
Really? When?

940
01:09:30,763 --> 01:09:32,230
Many years ago.

941
01:09:34,534 --> 01:09:38,436
My brother and l used to race
through these rooms.

942
01:09:38,905 --> 01:09:43,308
He was a wonderful kid.
We were very close in those days.

943
01:09:46,512 --> 01:09:50,141
My father had high hopes for him
but it never seemed...

944
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:52,113
...to work out for him.

945
01:09:56,089 --> 01:09:58,319
Do you mind if l take a minute?

946
01:09:58,524 --> 01:10:01,584
Everything seems to be
flooding through me.

947
01:10:01,794 --> 01:10:03,284
Sure.

948
01:10:25,018 --> 01:10:27,543
Sol, get on with it, I`m hungry,

949
01:10:27,987 --> 01:10:31,423
-Do you mind, May?
-This is such mumbo jumbo.

950
01:10:31,624 --> 01:10:33,057
Bring on the food.

951
01:10:33,259 --> 01:10:35,887
l apologize for
my disrespectful sister.

952
01:10:36,095 --> 01:10:41,294
This is the 20th century. Don`t fill
their heads with superstition.

953
01:10:41,501 --> 01:10:43,696
The intellectual, the teacher.

954
01:10:43,903 --> 01:10:46,804
Spare us your Leninist philosophy
for once.

955
01:10:47,006 --> 01:10:49,634
lf you don`t obey,
God will punish you?

956
01:10:49,842 --> 01:10:52,811
-Not me. He punishes the wicked.
-Like Hitler?

957
01:10:53,012 --> 01:10:54,479
We`re having a Seder!

958
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,808
Six million Jews killed,
they got away with it.

959
01:10:58,017 --> 01:11:01,077
-How`d they get away with it?
-Open your eyes!

960
01:11:01,287 --> 01:11:04,313
Six million Jews.
They got off with nothing.

961
01:11:04,524 --> 01:11:07,891
-How could men do such a thing?
-Might makes right.

962
01:11:08,094 --> 01:11:12,360
-Until the Americans--
-l don`t like this talk at Seder.

963
01:11:12,565 --> 01:11:13,827
Okay! All right!

964
01:11:14,033 --> 01:11:17,594
-I think this is interesting,
-Yeah, you do,

965
01:11:17,804 --> 01:11:19,601
There`s this joke,

966
01:11:19,806 --> 01:11:21,967
A prizefighter enters the ring.

967
01:11:22,175 --> 01:11:25,633
His brother asks the family priest
to pray for him.

968
01:11:25,845 --> 01:11:29,281
He said, ``Okay.
But if he can punch, it`ll help.``

969
01:11:29,482 --> 01:11:33,885
So you`re saying you challenge
the moral structure of everything?

970
01:11:34,087 --> 01:11:38,148
Moral structure? You use
that nonsense on your pupils?

971
01:11:38,357 --> 01:11:41,588
You don`t find human impulses
basically decent?

972
01:11:41,794 --> 01:11:46,356
-There`s basically nothing.
-A cynic, a nihilist. Back to Russia.

973
01:11:46,566 --> 01:11:49,933
Well, listen. l happen
to agree with May...

974
01:11:50,136 --> 01:11:52,195
...when it comes to mumbo jumbo.

975
01:11:52,405 --> 01:11:56,136
But you come to every Seder.
You pray in Hebrew.

976
01:11:56,342 --> 01:12:00,278
l go through the motions.
Like any ritual, it`s a habit.

977
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,541
So you say there`s no morality
anywhere in the whole world?

978
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:09,210
For those who want it, it`s there.
Nothing`s handed down in stone.

979
01:12:09,422 --> 01:12:11,515
Sol`s kind of faith is a gift.

980
01:12:11,724 --> 01:12:14,852
lt`s like an ear for music
or talent to draw.

981
01:12:15,061 --> 01:12:18,724
You use logic on him all day
and he still believes.

982
01:12:18,931 --> 01:12:22,924
-Must everything be logical?
-And if a man commits a crime?

983
01:12:23,136 --> 01:12:24,694
lf he--

984
01:12:24,904 --> 01:12:26,337
lf he kills?

985
01:12:27,473 --> 01:12:31,136
-ln some way, he`ll be punished.
-lf he`s caught, Sol.

986
01:12:31,344 --> 01:12:35,940
``What originates from a black deed
will blossom in a foul manner.``

987
01:12:36,149 --> 01:12:39,277
You`re relying too heavily
on the Bible.

988
01:12:39,485 --> 01:12:43,922
Whether it`s the Old Testament
or Shakespeare, murder will out.

989
01:12:44,123 --> 01:12:47,650
-Who said anything about murder?
-You did.

990
01:12:50,096 --> 01:12:51,427
Did l?

991
01:12:53,666 --> 01:12:56,601
l say, if he can do it
and get away with it...

992
01:12:56,802 --> 01:13:00,704
...and chooses not to be bothered
by ethics, he`s home free.

993
01:13:00,907 --> 01:13:03,637
History is written by the winners.

994
01:13:03,843 --> 01:13:07,574
Had the Nazis won,
future generations would understand...

995
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:09,941
...World War ll quite differently.

996
01:13:10,149 --> 01:13:14,017
Your aunt is brilliant,
but she`s had an unhappy life.

997
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:19,419
And if all your faith is wrong--
l mean, just what if? lf?

998
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:22,753
l`ll still have a better life
than doubters.

999
01:13:22,962 --> 01:13:26,955
Wait a minute. Are you saying
you prefer God to the truth?

1000
01:13:27,166 --> 01:13:32,001
-l`ll always choose God over truth.
-l agree with him.

1001
01:13:32,638 --> 01:13:35,505
l say, what goes around comes around.

1002
01:13:40,613 --> 01:13:45,016
-You okay? l was worried. lt`s late.
-l had some business.

1003
01:13:45,218 --> 01:13:46,708
Mrs. Ames is waiting.

1004
01:13:46,919 --> 01:13:49,251
-Any messages?
-You got an odd one.

1005
01:13:49,455 --> 01:13:52,720
A Detective O`Donnell
wanted to talk to you.

1006
01:13:52,925 --> 01:13:57,487
l tried to ask him what about,
but he only wants to talk with you.

1007
01:14:17,316 --> 01:14:20,945
-lt`s not a great movie, but it`s fun.
-l liked it.

1008
01:14:21,153 --> 01:14:23,485
Maybe l want to be an actress.

1009
01:14:23,689 --> 01:14:28,592
l don`t want you to be an actress.
Be on the Supreme Court or a doctor.

1010
01:14:28,794 --> 01:14:30,921
Show business is dog-eat-dog.

1011
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:36,067
lt`s worse than dog-eat-dog. lt`s
dog-doesn`t-return-other-dog`s-calls.

1012
01:14:36,269 --> 01:14:38,294
l should check my service.

1013
01:14:38,504 --> 01:14:41,302
l don`t know why.
l never have messages.

1014
01:14:41,507 --> 01:14:45,034
-l call, l hear the girls giggling.
-How`s Halley?

1015
01:14:45,244 --> 01:14:48,042
She`s great. l`m gonna make my move.

1016
01:14:48,247 --> 01:14:52,343
But l have this ethical dilemma
because l`m married.

1017
01:14:52,551 --> 01:14:55,520
Clifford Stern. Any messages?
Can you check?

1018
01:14:55,721 --> 01:14:58,656
My heart says one thing.
My head, another.

1019
01:14:58,858 --> 01:15:02,589
lt`s hard to get your heart
and head together in life.

1020
01:15:02,795 --> 01:15:05,764
ln my case, they`re not
even friendly. Yes?

1021
01:15:09,635 --> 01:15:11,068
Really?

1022
01:15:16,709 --> 01:15:18,142
No.

1023
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,204
Okay. Thank you.

1024
01:15:25,751 --> 01:15:27,082
What`s wrong?

1025
01:15:30,389 --> 01:15:32,323
Professor Levy...

1026
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:34,785
...committed suicide.

1027
01:15:36,028 --> 01:15:38,326
But we must always remember,,,

1028
01:15:38,531 --> 01:15:42,126
,,, that we--
When we are born,,,

1029
01:15:42,335 --> 01:15:44,963
,,,we need a great deal of love,,,

1030
01:15:45,171 --> 01:15:48,766
,,,in order to persuade us
to stay in life,

1031
01:15:48,974 --> 01:15:52,774
Once we get that love,
it usually lasts us,

1032
01:15:52,978 --> 01:15:55,606
But the universe is a cold place,

1033
01:15:55,815 --> 01:15:59,273
It`s we who invest it
with our feelings,

1034
01:15:59,485 --> 01:16:02,147
And under certain conditions,,,

1035
01:16:02,355 --> 01:16:05,950
,,,we feel that the thing
isn`t worth it anymore,

1036
01:16:06,158 --> 01:16:10,720
l came as soon as l heard. l thought
you wouldn`t want to be alone.

1037
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:15,390
God, it`s been terrible. l called--
The guy was not sick at all.

1038
01:16:15,601 --> 01:16:19,264
He left a note that said,
``l`ve gone out the window.``

1039
01:16:19,472 --> 01:16:23,738
A major intellectual, and this
is his note. What does it mean?

1040
01:16:23,943 --> 01:16:25,410
He was a role model.

1041
01:16:25,611 --> 01:16:30,571
-You`d think he`d leave a decent note.
-Did he have family or anything?

1042
01:16:30,783 --> 01:16:35,652
They were killed in the war. lt`s
strange. He`s seen the worst in life.

1043
01:16:35,855 --> 01:16:40,019
He always said yes to life.
Now today he said no.

1044
01:16:40,226 --> 01:16:43,855
lmagine his students,
how shattered they will be.

1045
01:16:44,063 --> 01:16:48,022
Where l grew up, in Brooklyn,
nobody committed suicide.

1046
01:16:48,234 --> 01:16:52,534
-Everyone was too unhappy.
-This will put a damper on the show.

1047
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:55,730
l got 600,000 feet of film
on this guy...

1048
01:16:55,941 --> 01:16:58,535
...and he`s telling how great life is.

1049
01:16:58,744 --> 01:17:01,474
l`ll cut it up,
use it for guitar picks.

1050
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:04,615
l was thinking,
no matter how elaborate...

1051
01:17:04,817 --> 01:17:07,581
...a philosophical system
you work out...

1052
01:17:07,787 --> 01:17:11,188
...in the end,
it`s gotta be incomplete.

1053
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:15,486
l`ve been so annoyed all day.
l`m sorry for seeming cranky.

1054
01:17:15,694 --> 01:17:20,188
No, l understand. l just thought
you might want some company.

1055
01:17:23,235 --> 01:17:25,135
No. Don`t do that.

1056
01:17:25,704 --> 01:17:28,639
lt`s something l`ve wanted
to do for weeks.

1057
01:17:28,841 --> 01:17:30,900
-You must know.
-You`re married.

1058
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:32,407
Yes, l`m married.

1059
01:17:32,611 --> 01:17:35,944
But, you know, that`s
not gonna last. l mean....

1060
01:17:36,148 --> 01:17:37,513
Well, you know...

1061
01:17:37,716 --> 01:17:39,911
...l`m not ready.

1062
01:17:41,654 --> 01:17:44,487
ls there something you`re
not telling me?

1063
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:45,679
No.

1064
01:17:45,891 --> 01:17:48,951
ls there someone else?
Don`t say it`s Lester.

1065
01:17:49,161 --> 01:17:51,356
lt`s me. lt`s just me.

1066
01:17:51,564 --> 01:17:55,523
l guess l haven`t gotten over
my divorce yet, you know?

1067
01:17:55,734 --> 01:17:59,329
And also, l feel unsettled
about my career.

1068
01:17:59,538 --> 01:18:01,563
l`m very ambitious.

1069
01:18:01,774 --> 01:18:05,505
And that`s an area that
l`d like to get consolidated.

1070
01:18:05,711 --> 01:18:08,475
l just feel, you know, unsettled.

1071
01:18:22,795 --> 01:18:24,160
Don`t confuse me.

1072
01:18:24,363 --> 01:18:28,629
-l`m not trying to confuse you.
-l don`t know what l`m doing.

1073
01:18:29,034 --> 01:18:32,197
l better go. l should just leave.

1074
01:18:32,404 --> 01:18:35,168
-You just got here.
-l know, but l--

1075
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:39,944
-l`m sorry, l didn`t mean--
-No, that`s okay. l`ll see you soon.

1076
01:18:40,145 --> 01:18:42,477
l`ll just-- l`ll be seeing you.

1077
01:18:46,318 --> 01:18:47,785
Please come in.

1078
01:18:49,455 --> 01:18:51,582
We read about it in the paper.

1079
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:56,193
lt`s a terrible thing.
She`d been coming here for years.

1080
01:18:56,395 --> 01:18:58,363
-Please, sit down.
-Thank you.

1081
01:18:59,164 --> 01:19:03,498
Just a few questions, doctor.
Records show she phoned you here...

1082
01:19:03,702 --> 01:19:06,569
...and at your home a number of times.

1083
01:19:06,772 --> 01:19:10,572
-She worried about her eyes.
-What was she suffering from?

1084
01:19:10,776 --> 01:19:15,804
Nothing serious. She had
light flashes, and they alarmed her.

1085
01:19:16,015 --> 01:19:18,449
l never found anything very wrong.

1086
01:19:18,651 --> 01:19:21,620
l told her it was just
a common occurrence.

1087
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:25,620
-She was a hypochondriac?
-No. l wouldn`t say that.

1088
01:19:25,824 --> 01:19:27,485
But she was concerned.

1089
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:31,823
There`s nothing she said
you think might be relevant?

1090
01:19:32,031 --> 01:19:33,828
Personal life? Friends?

1091
01:19:34,033 --> 01:19:36,001
No, not really.

1092
01:19:36,869 --> 01:19:38,769
How did she come to you?

1093
01:19:40,339 --> 01:19:44,002
l honestly can`t remember.
Possibly another patient.

1094
01:19:44,209 --> 01:19:45,642
Can l get that name?

1095
01:19:45,844 --> 01:19:49,302
lt was a while ago,
and l treat so many patients.

1096
01:19:49,515 --> 01:19:52,348
-Might it be in your records?
-No.

1097
01:19:52,551 --> 01:19:55,543
No. l doubt it very much.

1098
01:19:56,455 --> 01:19:59,185
-Sorry to take up your time.
-That`s okay.

1099
01:19:59,391 --> 01:20:02,292
lf you remember anything
that might help...

1100
01:20:02,494 --> 01:20:04,325
-...will you call me?
-Sure.

1101
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:06,464
-Thank you.
-Pleasure.

1102
01:20:16,508 --> 01:20:18,305
You`re having a breakdown!

1103
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:22,071
They know she phoned me.
l lied. They saw through it.

1104
01:20:22,281 --> 01:20:25,682
-l can`t take this.
-Pull yourself together.

1105
01:20:25,884 --> 01:20:29,012
l did it. lt`s irrevocable,
and l`m gonna pay.

1106
01:20:29,221 --> 01:20:32,987
l had to fight an urge
to come clean to the police.

1107
01:20:33,192 --> 01:20:37,686
l`m in this with you. l helped you.
l don`t wanna go to jail.

1108
01:20:37,896 --> 01:20:42,629
You get ideas about confessing,
and you`ll drag me down with you.

1109
01:20:42,835 --> 01:20:44,803
But l won`t let that happen.

1110
01:20:45,004 --> 01:20:48,371
-ls that a threat?
-Be a man. You`re in the clear.

1111
01:20:48,574 --> 01:20:50,735
-You`ll have me killed?
-Nonsense.

1112
01:20:50,943 --> 01:20:53,776
What did you mean by that remark?

1113
01:20:53,979 --> 01:20:56,573
You`ve helped me in the past. Fine.

1114
01:20:56,782 --> 01:20:58,807
l did you a favor. All right?

1115
01:20:59,018 --> 01:21:03,318
The time to confess was to Miriam
about your mistress.

1116
01:21:03,522 --> 01:21:05,854
Not about this! This is murder.

1117
01:21:06,058 --> 01:21:10,392
You paid for it, l engineered it.
lt`s over! Forget about it!

1118
01:21:10,896 --> 01:21:14,457
-One sin leads to a deeper sin.
-You sound like Papa.

1119
01:21:14,667 --> 01:21:18,068
Adultery, fornication, lies, killing.

1120
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:21,364
-Can you shut up?
-Or what? You`ll shut me up?

1121
01:21:21,573 --> 01:21:24,633
One phone call,
like pushing a button right?

1122
01:22:01,191 --> 01:22:04,752
l don`t know what`s wrong
with you these days.

1123
01:22:05,862 --> 01:22:08,023
l believe in God, Miriam.

1124
01:22:08,898 --> 01:22:13,733
l know it. Because without God,
the world is a cesspool.

1125
01:22:13,937 --> 01:22:17,100
You drink every day.
You never used to.

1126
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:18,865
lt`s something new.

1127
01:22:19,075 --> 01:22:21,543
-God, it`s hot.
-Maybe we should go--

1128
01:22:21,745 --> 01:22:25,579
-Don`t tell me what to do, damn it!
-Will you calm down?

1129
01:22:28,451 --> 01:22:31,352
l don`t feel well.
l`m gonna get some air.

1130
01:22:31,554 --> 01:22:33,283
No, you stay here.

1131
01:22:56,780 --> 01:23:00,272
This homeless story is too long,
I want five pages,

1132
01:23:00,483 --> 01:23:02,212
Five real pages,

1133
01:23:02,419 --> 01:23:06,446
His secretary types it tighter,
He doesn`t take a thing out,

1134
01:23:06,656 --> 01:23:08,556
I want Johanson off the show,

1135
01:23:08,758 --> 01:23:12,854
He has cancer, Send him flowers,
He`s not funny,

1136
01:23:13,063 --> 01:23:14,257
I want him off,

1137
01:23:14,464 --> 01:23:19,527
Can`t anyone write funny anymore? I`m
supposed to write everything myself?

1138
01:23:19,736 --> 01:23:22,227
Write, direct and produce it myself?

1139
01:23:22,439 --> 01:23:26,671
I can`t believe this!
Look at the people out there!

1140
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:31,540
These people are looking for
something funny in their lives!

1141
01:23:31,748 --> 01:23:34,740
They`re waiting for something funny!

1142
01:23:53,303 --> 01:23:55,134
This is terrible.

1143
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:57,305
What are you doing to me?

1144
01:23:57,507 --> 01:24:00,408
This isn`t a profile
of a creative mind!

1145
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:05,804
It`s tough for a woman in this
profession, Men always hit on them,

1146
01:24:06,015 --> 01:24:08,984
What is this? When did you shoot that?

1147
01:24:09,185 --> 01:24:12,643
l was lurking around the corner.
l couldn`t resist.

1148
01:24:12,856 --> 01:24:15,324
I don`t wanna do it
in a vulgar way,,,

1149
01:24:15,525 --> 01:24:18,289
,,,and take it off
from what I see here,

1150
01:24:18,495 --> 01:24:21,055
I wanna find out what`s in here,

1151
01:24:21,264 --> 01:24:24,927
So I gotta spend some time,
have dinner together,

1152
01:24:25,135 --> 01:24:27,228
l`m taking over this film.

1153
01:24:27,437 --> 01:24:31,168
-You can`t finish my film.
-l can`t? Read your contract.

1154
01:24:31,374 --> 01:24:34,969
-You promised.
-The idea was to show the real me.

1155
01:24:35,178 --> 01:24:38,705
l`m not perfect, but l don`t
promote values that--

1156
01:24:38,915 --> 01:24:40,280
Let me quote you:

1157
01:24:40,483 --> 01:24:43,281
``--deaden the sensibilities
of democracy.``

1158
01:24:43,486 --> 01:24:46,011
You`re fired. Get out of here!

1159
01:24:46,222 --> 01:24:48,554
Go! Thank you! Goodbye!

1160
01:24:48,892 --> 01:24:53,090
If it bends, it`s funny,
If it breaks, it isn`t,

1161
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:57,591
Don`t get discouraged.
You have your own vision.

1162
01:24:57,801 --> 01:25:02,170
Why was he so mad? As if nobody
was ever compared to Mussolini.

1163
01:25:02,372 --> 01:25:07,503
l`d no idea you`d cut it like this. l
could`ve told you they`d never use it.

1164
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:10,042
They want an upbeat profile.

1165
01:25:10,246 --> 01:25:13,807
He`s gonna re-cut it
and make himself into a saint.

1166
01:25:14,017 --> 01:25:18,454
Wendy`s right. l`m jealous of him
with his limos and his money.

1167
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:22,421
-You have your own style.
-Listen. Marry me. l`m serious.

1168
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:24,820
That`s all l want. Marry me.

1169
01:25:25,028 --> 01:25:28,259
l`m crazy about you.
My marriage won`t last.

1170
01:25:28,465 --> 01:25:32,265
l gotta talk to you.
Can we sit down for a second?

1171
01:25:32,469 --> 01:25:35,700
l`m not joking.
l`m really nuts about you.

1172
01:25:35,905 --> 01:25:37,805
l`m going away.

1173
01:25:40,043 --> 01:25:42,341
Yeah? Meaning what?

1174
01:25:43,146 --> 01:25:47,674
l`ve got a chance to produce
a couple of shows in London...

1175
01:25:47,884 --> 01:25:50,478
...and, you know, l couldn`t say no.

1176
01:25:51,754 --> 01:25:56,384
-How long are you going for?
-Well, probably three or four months.

1177
01:25:56,926 --> 01:25:59,588
Three or four months?

1178
01:26:00,763 --> 01:26:04,927
Jesus. You`re kidding.
What a discouraging thought.

1179
01:26:05,134 --> 01:26:07,227
But l think it`s a good thing...

1180
01:26:07,437 --> 01:26:11,874
...because l need-- Well,
it will give me a little distance.

1181
01:26:12,075 --> 01:26:15,909
About 3000 miles, to be exact.
When are you leaving?

1182
01:26:16,112 --> 01:26:18,876
Oh, l guess 1 0 days or so.

1183
01:26:20,183 --> 01:26:21,650
God, l`m--

1184
01:26:26,656 --> 01:26:30,490
God, l`m gonna miss you.
l don`t know what to say.

1185
01:26:31,528 --> 01:26:34,827
l`m not gonna see you
for three or four months?

1186
01:26:35,932 --> 01:26:40,460
l feel like l`ve, you know,
been handed a prison sentence.

1187
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:13,224
Ben, your daughter
will make a beautiful bride.

1188
01:27:14,103 --> 01:27:17,630
This is Barbara,
the sister of my brother-in-law.

1189
01:27:18,241 --> 01:27:23,304
Congratulations. l wish
your daughter all the happiness.

1190
01:27:24,547 --> 01:27:25,536
Thank you.

1191
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:32,247
Jesus, l`m so self-conscious.
Every single thing on me is rented:

1192
01:27:32,455 --> 01:27:35,515
A rented tux, rented shoes,
rented underwear.

1193
01:27:35,725 --> 01:27:37,955
You look fine. Do me a favor.

1194
01:27:38,161 --> 01:27:42,325
This is your last occasion
with my family. Let`s get along.

1195
01:27:42,532 --> 01:27:44,966
Oh, and this is Dr. Rosenthal.

1196
01:27:45,168 --> 01:27:47,227
-l`m Miriam.
-This is Miriam.

1197
01:27:47,437 --> 01:27:49,405
This is Marian and Peter.

1198
01:27:49,606 --> 01:27:52,131
How do you do? lt`s a pleasure.

1199
01:27:52,342 --> 01:27:54,367
-Judah?
-Yes, Ben?

1200
01:27:54,577 --> 01:27:57,740
l`m so glad you could make it.
lt means a lot.

1201
01:28:00,464 --> 01:28:03,956
What is the matter with you?
You seem so depressed.

1202
01:28:04,168 --> 01:28:07,604
Wendy and l finally
decided to call it quits.

1203
01:28:07,805 --> 01:28:12,640
Even though the last few years
have been terrible, it makes me sad.

1204
01:28:12,843 --> 01:28:15,368
-l`ll have a vodka and tonic.
-Me too.

1205
01:28:15,579 --> 01:28:18,946
You told me it`s been
platonic for a year.

1206
01:28:19,150 --> 01:28:21,448
Once the sex goes, it all goes.

1207
01:28:21,652 --> 01:28:26,715
Last time l was inside a woman was
when l visited the Statue of Liberty.

1208
01:28:35,366 --> 01:28:38,893
Your father`s celebrating
enough for two people.

1209
01:28:39,103 --> 01:28:42,869
He and Ben will get high
and argue about belief in God.

1210
01:28:43,073 --> 01:28:45,337
My dad takes after his Aunt May.

1211
01:28:45,543 --> 01:28:50,503
She rejected the Bible because it had
an unbelievable sense of character.

1212
01:28:51,215 --> 01:28:56,016
l walked in. l said, ``The Waldorf
Astoria.`` You see the centerpieces?

1213
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:59,212
Did you see the matches?
Lester paid for it.

1214
01:28:59,423 --> 01:29:02,824
l can`t believe a brother
would pay for a wedding.

1215
01:29:03,027 --> 01:29:06,428
That`s the sort of thing
Lester`s always doing.

1216
01:29:06,630 --> 01:29:11,590
-You`ve known him for a long time?
-Since high school.

1217
01:29:24,915 --> 01:29:28,009
They`re pretty.
They`re very, very pretty.

1218
01:29:28,219 --> 01:29:30,187
-Hi, Cliff.
-Cliff, hello.

1219
01:29:30,387 --> 01:29:33,015
Lester, how are you? Good to see you.

1220
01:29:33,224 --> 01:29:36,887
-My fiancée, Halley.
-Congratulations. My wife, Nancy.

1221
01:29:37,862 --> 01:29:40,456
-Jesus, you look wonderful.
-Thank you.

1222
01:29:41,131 --> 01:29:42,598
When did you return?

1223
01:29:43,033 --> 01:29:46,764
l got back this morning.
l`ve been trying to call you.

1224
01:29:46,971 --> 01:29:50,236
l finally won her heart.
What a romantic story.

1225
01:29:50,441 --> 01:29:52,466
We saw each other in London.

1226
01:29:52,676 --> 01:29:55,839
l sent her white roses
around the clock...

1227
01:29:56,046 --> 01:30:00,107
...all the time, for days.
Then l found out she was allergic.

1228
01:30:00,317 --> 01:30:02,444
-Hi.
-Hi. Congratulations.

1229
01:30:02,653 --> 01:30:03,881
Good to see you.

1230
01:30:04,088 --> 01:30:06,454
So l started pleading with her.

1231
01:30:06,657 --> 01:30:09,285
l just begged her day and night.

1232
01:30:09,493 --> 01:30:12,485
And l think it was
the caviar that did it.

1233
01:30:12,696 --> 01:30:15,164
l`ve envied this guy for years.

1234
01:30:15,366 --> 01:30:18,858
He`d show up with a beautiful woman
all the time.

1235
01:30:19,069 --> 01:30:22,038
-But l envy you more now.
-Thank you.

1236
01:30:48,365 --> 01:30:51,027
Standing here
in the presence of God...

1237
01:30:51,235 --> 01:30:55,569
...the guardian of our homes,
ready to enter the bonds of wedlock...

1238
01:30:55,773 --> 01:30:59,265
...answer each of you,
in reverence for God...

1239
01:30:59,476 --> 01:31:02,673
...and in hearing of
the assembly gathered here...

1240
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,314
...so joyously with you.

1241
01:31:13,757 --> 01:31:15,850
-l know the perfect guy.
-Who?

1242
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:20,019
-He`s brilliant, attractive.
-There`s a hitch. l`m waiting.

1243
01:31:20,230 --> 01:31:24,223
There is, but it sounds worse
than it is. He`s in prison.

1244
01:31:24,435 --> 01:31:28,132
-That`s a drawback.
-Nothing terrible. lnsider trading.

1245
01:31:28,339 --> 01:31:32,002
He made a fortune in the market.
He`ll be out soon.

1246
01:31:32,209 --> 01:31:34,404
Very soon. A couple of years.

1247
01:31:34,611 --> 01:31:36,738
You mean with good behavior.

1248
01:31:55,532 --> 01:31:57,796
l wanted to talk to you.

1249
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:08,442
What is there really to say?
You know, l`m just stunned still.

1250
01:32:11,181 --> 01:32:14,548
He`s not what you think.
He`s wonderful.

1251
01:32:14,752 --> 01:32:18,017
He`s warm and caring...

1252
01:32:18,222 --> 01:32:22,181
-...and romantic.
-He`s a success, that`s what he is.

1253
01:32:22,393 --> 01:32:26,261
-He`s rich and he`s a success.
-Give me a little credit.

1254
01:32:26,463 --> 01:32:29,955
l always did give you
a little credit until today.

1255
01:32:30,167 --> 01:32:35,161
We used to laugh at him. The silly
shows he puts on, the way he talks.

1256
01:32:35,372 --> 01:32:37,306
He`s endearing.

1257
01:32:38,742 --> 01:32:42,041
This is my worst fear realized.

1258
01:32:47,584 --> 01:32:50,246
l wanted to give you this letter back.

1259
01:32:53,757 --> 01:32:56,851
-lt`s my one love letter.
-lt`s beautiful.

1260
01:32:57,061 --> 01:32:59,689
l`m just the wrong person.

1261
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,493
lt`s probably just as well.

1262
01:33:07,471 --> 01:33:10,565
l plagiarized most of it
from James Joyce.

1263
01:33:11,909 --> 01:33:15,401
You probably wondered
about the Dublin references.

1264
01:33:17,281 --> 01:33:20,808
l hope we can always be friends.

1265
01:34:05,013 --> 01:34:08,414
Off by yourself, huh? You`re like me.

1266
01:34:09,584 --> 01:34:12,382
l always get sad at these events.

1267
01:34:12,587 --> 01:34:14,646
You look very deep in thought.

1268
01:34:17,525 --> 01:34:19,959
l was plotting the perfect murder.

1269
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:23,954
Movie plot?

1270
01:34:24,899 --> 01:34:26,196
Movie?

1271
01:34:27,335 --> 01:34:31,237
That`s what Ben told me.
He says you make films.

1272
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:35,773
Yeah, but not that kind.
You know, a different kind.

1273
01:34:37,545 --> 01:34:39,945
l have a great murder story.

1274
01:34:41,249 --> 01:34:43,547
-Yes?
-A great plot.

1275
01:34:44,552 --> 01:34:45,883
Yeah.

1276
01:34:47,856 --> 01:34:51,587
Hey, l`ve had too many to drink.
l mean, forgive me.

1277
01:34:51,793 --> 01:34:53,920
l know you want your privacy.

1278
01:34:54,129 --> 01:34:58,463
No, it`s okay.
l`m not doing anything special.

1279
01:34:59,033 --> 01:35:04,369
Except my murder story
has a very strange twist.

1280
01:35:06,174 --> 01:35:07,471
Yeah?

1281
01:35:09,244 --> 01:35:13,408
Let`s say there`s this man
who is very successful.

1282
01:35:13,615 --> 01:35:15,344
He has everything.

1283
01:35:22,891 --> 01:35:25,086
-Let me ask you something.
-What?

1284
01:35:25,293 --> 01:35:27,261
-Am l a phony?
-Are you what?

1285
01:35:27,462 --> 01:35:30,556
-Am l a phony?
-Are you a little high?

1286
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:32,689
-He hates me.
-Who?

1287
01:35:32,901 --> 01:35:37,065
Your annoying husband.
Every time l`m with him, l get tense.

1288
01:35:37,272 --> 01:35:39,467
-He`s angry.
-At what?

1289
01:35:39,674 --> 01:35:40,800
Are you kidding?

1290
01:35:41,009 --> 01:35:44,410
He`s got these fantasies
about changing the world.

1291
01:35:44,612 --> 01:35:47,240
ln the end, his films come to nothing.

1292
01:35:47,448 --> 01:35:51,578
He`s gotta grow up.
This is the real world, the big time.

1293
01:35:51,786 --> 01:35:55,620
They don`t pay for high aspirations.
You gotta deliver.

1294
01:35:55,824 --> 01:35:59,419
Not to mention the fact that--
You`re still young.

1295
01:35:59,627 --> 01:36:03,859
-You`re not getting what you deserve.
-Lester, l met somebody.

1296
01:36:07,068 --> 01:36:09,229
That is music to my ears.

1297
01:36:11,005 --> 01:36:13,496
And after the awful deed is done...

1298
01:36:13,708 --> 01:36:17,144
...he finds that he`s plagued
by deep-rooted guilt.

1299
01:36:17,345 --> 01:36:20,803
Little sparks of
his religious background...

1300
01:36:21,015 --> 01:36:25,076
...which he`d rejected,
are suddenly stirred up.

1301
01:36:26,521 --> 01:36:29,513
He hears his father`s voice.

1302
01:36:29,858 --> 01:36:33,726
He imagines that God
is watching his every move.

1303
01:36:33,928 --> 01:36:36,795
Suddenly, it`s not
an empty universe...

1304
01:36:36,998 --> 01:36:39,831
...but a just and moral one...

1305
01:36:40,134 --> 01:36:42,159
...and he`s violated it.

1306
01:36:42,837 --> 01:36:45,067
Now he`s panic-stricken.

1307
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:48,036
He`s on the verge
of a mental collapse.

1308
01:36:48,243 --> 01:36:52,703
An inch away from confessing
the whole thing to the police.

1309
01:36:53,748 --> 01:36:56,808
And then one morning...

1310
01:36:57,018 --> 01:36:58,849
...he awakens...

1311
01:36:59,454 --> 01:37:03,185
...and the sun is shining,
and his family is around him.

1312
01:37:03,391 --> 01:37:07,555
Mysteriously, the crisis is lifted.

1313
01:37:09,197 --> 01:37:13,497
He takes his family to Europe
and as the months pass...

1314
01:37:13,701 --> 01:37:15,669
...he finds he`s not punished.

1315
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:18,061
ln fact, he prospers.

1316
01:37:18,673 --> 01:37:21,369
The killing`s attributed
to a drifter...

1317
01:37:21,576 --> 01:37:24,067
...who has many murders to his credit.

1318
01:37:24,279 --> 01:37:27,043
What the hell,
one more doesn`t matter.

1319
01:37:27,715 --> 01:37:29,808
Now he`s scot-free.

1320
01:37:30,351 --> 01:37:33,684
His life is completely
back to normal...

1321
01:37:34,222 --> 01:37:38,921
...back to his protected world
of wealth and privilege.

1322
01:37:39,294 --> 01:37:42,855
Yes, but can he ever really go back?

1323
01:37:44,732 --> 01:37:48,668
Well, people carry sins
around with them, l mean....

1324
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:53,603
Oh, maybe once in a while
he has a bad moment, but it passes.

1325
01:37:54,008 --> 01:37:56,875
And with time, it all fades.

1326
01:37:57,345 --> 01:37:59,677
Yeah, but-- So then, you know--

1327
01:37:59,881 --> 01:38:03,612
Then his worst beliefs are realized.

1328
01:38:03,818 --> 01:38:06,787
l said it was
a chilling story, didn`t l?

1329
01:38:08,856 --> 01:38:12,485
l think it`d be tough for
somebody to live with that.

1330
01:38:12,694 --> 01:38:16,926
Very few guys could actually live
with something like that.

1331
01:38:17,131 --> 01:38:21,067
People carry awful deeds with them.
What should he do?

1332
01:38:21,269 --> 01:38:22,827
Turn himself in?

1333
01:38:23,404 --> 01:38:25,235
l mean, this is reality.

1334
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,533
ln reality, we rationalize.

1335
01:38:27,742 --> 01:38:31,109
We deny, or we couldn`t go on living.

1336
01:38:34,515 --> 01:38:37,609
l would have him turn himself in...

1337
01:38:37,819 --> 01:38:41,414
...because then your story
assumes tragic proportions.

1338
01:38:41,622 --> 01:38:43,920
Because in the absence of a God...

1339
01:38:44,125 --> 01:38:47,288
...he is forced to assume
that responsibility.

1340
01:38:47,495 --> 01:38:49,827
Then you have tragedy.

1341
01:38:50,164 --> 01:38:53,190
But that`s fiction,
that`s movies. l mean--

1342
01:38:53,401 --> 01:38:57,497
You see too many movies.
l`m talking about reality.

1343
01:38:57,705 --> 01:39:01,732
lf you want a happy ending,
go see a Hollywood movie.

1344
01:39:03,344 --> 01:39:07,371
Come on, darling.
Let`s think about going home, huh?

1345
01:39:07,582 --> 01:39:09,777
Nice talking to you. Good luck.

1346
01:39:09,984 --> 01:39:14,318
We`ll have a wedding like this
for Sharon, and l can`t wait.

1347
01:39:14,522 --> 01:39:16,752
She`ll be radiant.

1348
01:39:17,091 --> 01:39:21,687
-You`re looking very handsome tonight.
-And you look beautiful.

1349
01:39:45,153 --> 01:39:48,384
We are all faced
throughout our lives,,,

1350
01:39:48,589 --> 01:39:51,023
,,,with agonizing decisions,,,

1351
01:39:51,225 --> 01:39:53,216
,,,moral choices,

1352
01:39:53,428 --> 01:39:56,329
Some are on a grand scale,

1353
01:39:56,531 --> 01:40:00,763
Most of these choices
are on lesser points,

1354
01:40:01,803 --> 01:40:06,866
But we define ourselves
by the choices we have made,

1355
01:40:07,075 --> 01:40:12,035
We are, in fact,
the sum total of our choices,

1356
01:40:12,346 --> 01:40:15,645
Events unfold so unpredictably,,,

1357
01:40:16,050 --> 01:40:18,245
,,,so unfairly,,,

1358
01:40:18,453 --> 01:40:22,583
,,,human happiness does not seem
to have been included,,,

1359
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:25,190
,,,in the design of Creation,

1360
01:40:25,393 --> 01:40:29,887
It is only we,
with our capacity to love,,,

1361
01:40:30,098 --> 01:40:33,898
,,, that give meaning
to the indifferent universe,

1362
01:40:34,302 --> 01:40:37,499
And yet, most human beings,,,

1363
01:40:37,705 --> 01:40:41,607
,,,seem to have the ability
to keep trying,,,

1364
01:40:41,809 --> 01:40:46,075
,,,and even to find joy
from simple things,,,

1365
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:49,010
,,,like their family,,,

1366
01:40:49,217 --> 01:40:50,912
,,, their work,,,

1367
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:52,711
,,,and from the hope,,,

1368
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:55,616
,,, that future generations,,,

1369
01:40:55,823 --> 01:40:59,020
,,,might understand more,

1370
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:06,020
