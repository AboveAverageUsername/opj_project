3
00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:32,444
If, and only if,
both sides of the numerator -

4
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,097
- is divisible by the inverse
of the square root -

5
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:37,619
- of the two unassigned variables.

6
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,924
Good. Except when the value
of the "X" coordinate -

7
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:44,099
- is equal to or less than
the value of one.

8
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:47,448
- Yes, Isaac?
- What about that problem?

9
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:49,970
Oh, that?
Don't worry about that.

10
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:52,448
- "M" is...
- Wait. Why?

11
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,840
I just put that up as a joke.
That's probably -

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,146
- the hardest geometry
equation in the world.

13
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:59,798
How much extra credit is it worth?

14
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:02,755
Well, considering I've never
seen anyone get it right, -

15
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,885
- including my mentor,
Dr. Leaky at M.I.T. -

16
00:01:05,972 --> 00:01:08,582
- I guess if anyone here can solve
that problem, -

17
00:01:08,626 --> 00:01:12,192
- I'd see to it that none of you ever
have to open another math book again -

18
00:01:12,234 --> 00:01:14,583
- for the rest of your lives.

19
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:24,672
Max? Care to try it?

20
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,237
I'm sorry, did someone
say my name?

21
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:16,465
Fischer! Fischer!
Fischer! Fischer! Fischer!

22
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:31,597
Thank you.

23
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:35,423
You guys have it real easy.

24
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:39,598
I never had it like this
where I grew up.

25
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:43,338
But I send my kids here
because, the fact is, -

26
00:02:43,426 --> 00:02:45,860
- you go to one of the best
schools in the country:

27
00:02:45,947 --> 00:02:47,861
- Rushmore.
- Shh.

28
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:50,079
Now, for some of you, -

29
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:52,775
- it doesn't matter.

30
00:02:52,863 --> 00:02:56,124
You were born rich,
and you're going to stay rich.

31
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:59,124
But here's my advice
to the rest of you:

32
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,038
Take dead aim on the rich boys.

33
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,560
Get them
in the cross hairs -

34
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:09,604
- and take them down.

35
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:14,388
Just remember:
They can buy anything, -

36
00:03:14,475 --> 00:03:18,388
- but they can't buy backbone.

37
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,563
Don't let them forget that.

38
00:03:20,649 --> 00:03:22,563
Thank you.

39
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:32,086
Free for graduation, Herman?
Perhaps you could give us an encore.

40
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,566
- Nicholas! Copernicus!
- I don't give a shit.

41
00:03:34,652 --> 00:03:36,565
I paid for the whole damn natatorium.

42
00:03:36,653 --> 00:03:39,261
The least these little pricks
can do is hear me out.

43
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:41,741
- Hi, Dr. Guggenheim.
- Hello, Max.

44
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:43,914
Hello, I'm Max Fischer.

45
00:03:44,002 --> 00:03:47,959
I just wanted to say that I strongly
agree with your views concerning Rushmore.

46
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:51,220
Um... your speech was excellent.

47
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:53,438
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

48
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,438
- Thank you.
- Hello.

49
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:58,614
- Oh, Mr. Blume, this is my
chapel partner, Dirk Calloway.

50
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:00,788
Nice to meet you, Dirk.

51
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:02,788
Well, thanks.

52
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:09,572
You know...

53
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:13,137
I really think you're
right about Rushmore.

54
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:15,138
Come on, Dirk.

55
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:20,401
- What's his name again?
- Max Fischer.

56
00:04:21,617 --> 00:04:23,574
Sharp little guy.

57
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,576
He's one of the worst
students we've got.

58
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:49,764
We're putting you on what we call
"Sudden death academic probation."

59
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,200
And what does that entail?

60
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:54,765
It entails that if you
fail another class, -

61
00:05:54,808 --> 00:05:56,809
- you'll be asked
to leave Rushmore.

62
00:05:56,852 --> 00:05:59,331
In other words,
I'll be expelled.

63
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:00,679
That's correct.

64
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:03,375
Could I see some documentation
on that, please?

65
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,941
Too many extracurricular
activities, Max.

66
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:10,333
Not enough studying.

67
00:06:12,943 --> 00:06:16,682
Dr. Guggenheim, I don't want
to tell you how to do your job, -

68
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:18,856
- but, the fact is,
no matter how hard I try, -

69
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:20,858
- I still might flunk another class.

70
00:06:20,944 --> 00:06:24,944
If that means I have to stay on for a
postgraduate year, then so be it, but...

71
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:26,945
We don't offer
a postgraduate year.

72
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:30,424
Well... we don't offer it yet.

73
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:32,338
Just bring up the grades.

74
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:36,251
Do you remember how
I got into this school?

75
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:37,338
Yes.

76
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:40,469
- You wrote a play.
- That's right.

77
00:06:40,556 --> 00:06:44,557
Second grade.
A little one act about Watergate.

78
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:47,079
And my mother read it
and felt I should go to Rushmore.

79
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:50,210
And you read it, and
you gave me a scholarship, didn't you?

80
00:06:50,297 --> 00:06:52,384
Mm-hmm.

81
00:06:52,471 --> 00:06:55,255
- Do you regret it?
- No, I don't regret it.

82
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:58,125
But I still might
have to expel you.

83
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,125
Couldn't...

84
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:02,864
Couldn't we just
let me float by?

85
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:05,126
For old time's sake?

86
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:07,300
Can't do it, Max.

87
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:11,867
- They want to kick me out.
- Oh, no, not again.

88
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:14,475
- What are you gonna do?
- The only thing I can do:

89
00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:17,042
Try and pull some strings
with the administration, I guess.

90
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,521
Did you hear they're teaching
Japanese next year?

91
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:26,520
That's the rumor.

92
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:28,478
And they're canceling Latin.

93
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:30,479
What?

94
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:33,218
I tried to get Latin
canceled for five years.

95
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:35,697
"It's a dead language",
I'd always say.

96
00:07:35,783 --> 00:07:38,393
Well, I guess
they finally heard you.

97
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:55,092
Excuse me.

98
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,223
Could I please see a list
of all the people -

99
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:00,222
- who've checked out this book
in the past year?

100
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,659
Why?

101
00:08:02,745 --> 00:08:05,180
Look at that.

102
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:07,355
Hmm.

103
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:49,537
"I have seen wicked men and fools,
a great many of both -

104
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:52,189
- and I believe they both
get paid in the end.

105
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:55,059
But the fools first.

106
00:08:55,146 --> 00:08:59,235
Chapter 15.
The Lad with the Silver Button."

107
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:04,495
- Meet me on the corner in ten minutes.
- Where are you going?

108
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,844
I'll tell you
in the squad car.

109
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:08,845
Oh, and, Willie,

110
00:09:08,888 --> 00:09:11,019
you were wrong
about Enrique Sanchez.

111
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:14,150
He died in his sleep.

112
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:16,193
Excellent. That was excellent.

113
00:09:16,237 --> 00:09:18,193
That was great.
That was great.

114
00:09:18,237 --> 00:09:21,673
Um, Irving... could you get some
root beers for anybody who wants one?

115
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,674
- I don't want one, okay?
- Okay.

116
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,195
All right, next scene.

117
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:29,978
Frank, you enter stage right
with a bag of cocaine.

118
00:09:30,065 --> 00:09:32,675
I was just telling Mr. Calloway
the other day how fortunate we are -

119
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:34,241
- to have someone like you
looking out for Dirk.

120
00:09:34,284 --> 00:09:35,371
Oh, don't be silly.

121
00:09:35,414 --> 00:09:38,371
Dirk's a great kid,
and I'm just trying to impart -

122
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:42,764
- some of the experiences
I've accrued to help him.

123
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:44,851
This has my number on it
if you need to call me -

124
00:09:44,938 --> 00:09:48,591
- or need help with Dirk or
anything like that.

125
00:09:48,678 --> 00:09:50,721
Well, thank you very much. Hello, Dirk.

126
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:52,722
- Hi, Mom.
- How are you, honey?

127
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:53,766
Fine.

128
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:54,722
- Bye.
- Bye.

129
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:56,332
It was so nice
to see you again.

130
00:09:56,418 --> 00:10:00,723
- Hey, Dirk. How'd your math test go?
- What math test?

131
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:03,375
- I thought you had a math test today.
- No.

132
00:10:03,463 --> 00:10:05,899
Did you turn in your paper
on the Berlin Airlift?

133
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:07,942
Yeah, I got an extension.

134
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:10,725
- Hey, George.
- So how'd it go with Mrs. Calloway?

135
00:10:10,813 --> 00:10:14,074
- We shook hands.
- Big deal.

136
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:16,248
And I gave her
my phone number.

137
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:18,423
Buchan said he'd have
already banged her by now.

138
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,423
What?

139
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,249
Just tell that deformed Scottish gorilla
to shut his fat face.

140
00:10:25,597 --> 00:10:28,163
That's my best friend's mother
he's talking about.

141
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:30,729
I always thought that's why
you picked Dirk as your chapel partner.

142
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:32,860
What are you, a lawyer?

143
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:36,860
Hey, Mr. Blume.
Hey, it's Max Fischer.

144
00:10:36,947 --> 00:10:39,470
- Oh, hi.
Hey, Max, my mom just showed up.

145
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,470
Is it okay if I leave early? Over.

146
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:43,471
Sure, Charlie.

147
00:10:48,253 --> 00:10:51,212
What's the secret, Max?

148
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:53,037
- "The secret"?
- Yeah.

149
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,560
Well, you seem to have it
pretty figured out.

150
00:10:56,604 --> 00:10:58,908
The secret.
I don't know. Uh...

151
00:10:58,994 --> 00:11:01,256
I think you just gotta find
something you love to do, -

152
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:04,866
- and then do it
for the rest of your life.

153
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:07,562
For me, it's going to Rushmore.

154
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:10,301
Shotgun.

155
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:13,998
- Hey, Ronny. Hey, Donny. How you guys...
- Get in the back.

156
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:16,216
- I said, "Shotgun".
- Get in the back, Donny.

157
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:20,172
Let's go.

158
00:11:22,478 --> 00:11:25,044
Did you invite that kid
to your party?

159
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,044
Max Fischer?

160
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:27,566
Come on, Dad. There's
gonna be girls there.

161
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:30,392
- I'd rather die.
- Pull your head out of your ass.

162
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:34,915
- Good night, Mr. Littlejeans.
- Good night, Max.

163
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:36,959
I'll see you tomorrow.

164
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,917
May I see the back, please?

165
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:49,917
Certainly.

166
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:54,048
How's that?

167
00:11:54,136 --> 00:11:57,267
Thank you.

168
00:11:57,354 --> 00:12:01,268
I need a signature
on this geometry test, by the way.

169
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,355
Let's see.

170
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:07,269
- Hmm.
- I know, I know.

171
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:09,269
A 37.

172
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,791
Oh, I don't know
what to do anymore.

173
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,401
It could have been worse.

174
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:20,837
You almost got the "A".

175
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,576
"Almost got the 'A"?
Dad, what are you writing?

176
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:33,491
Maybe I'm spending too much
of my time starting up clubs -

177
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:35,578
- and putting on plays.

178
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,752
That's possible.

179
00:12:37,796 --> 00:12:41,406
- I should probably be trying
harder to score chicks.

180
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:44,579
That's the only thing
anybody really cares about.

181
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,537
It's not my forte, unfortunately.

182
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,755
It'll happen, Max. It's just...

183
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:52,408
You're like one of those
clipper ship captains.

184
00:12:52,494 --> 00:12:54,756
You're married to the sea.

185
00:12:54,843 --> 00:12:56,756
Yes, that's true.

186
00:12:56,843 --> 00:13:00,408
But I've been out to sea
for a long time.

187
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:09,541
- Hello.
- Hi.

188
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:19,847
I like your hat.

189
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:22,717
Oh, thank you.

190
00:13:22,804 --> 00:13:25,892
You're a teacher here,
aren't you?

191
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:30,066
And this is your first year
at Rushmore, I take it.

192
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,241
Uh-huh.

193
00:13:32,283 --> 00:13:35,676
And how long have you been a smoker,
if you don't mind me asking?

194
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:39,155
Well, let's see now.
H- How old are you?

195
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:41,546
Fifteen.

196
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:44,547
- Since I was your age.
- You're kidding.

197
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:46,504
You should quit.

198
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:49,287
You're right.

199
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:51,722
And I should mind my own business.

200
00:13:58,158 --> 00:14:00,594
Where did you go
to school, by the way?

201
00:14:00,637 --> 00:14:02,507
- Harvard.
- Really?

202
00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:04,507
That's a coincidence.

203
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:07,638
My top schools where I want
to apply to are Oxford and the Sorbonne.

204
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:09,683
My safety's Harvard.

205
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:13,509
- That's very ambitious.
- Thank you.

206
00:14:13,596 --> 00:14:15,727
What do you want to study?

207
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,857
Well... I haven't
decided for sure, -

208
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:23,685
- but probably a double major
in mathematics and premed.

209
00:14:23,772 --> 00:14:25,729
What was your major?

210
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:30,773
I didn't have a major, but my thesis
was on Latin American economic policy.

211
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,991
Oh, that's interesting.

212
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:34,731
Did you hear they're not going
to teach Latin here anymore?

213
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,862
This was more like Central America.

214
00:14:37,948 --> 00:14:40,905
Oh, Central America
and whatnot. Hmm.

215
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:43,559
But moving on:
They're gonna cancel Latin.

216
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:46,907
They've got
to make room for Japanese.

217
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,081
That's a shame because all the Romance
languages were based on Latin.

218
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,124
Yeah, they are,
aren't they?

219
00:14:53,212 --> 00:14:55,865
Nihilo sanctum estne?

220
00:14:55,952 --> 00:14:59,735
What's that?
Oh, it's Latin, isn't it?

221
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:01,909
What does that mean?

222
00:15:01,996 --> 00:15:04,997
Is nothing sacred?

223
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:15,346
Sic transit gloria.
Glory fades.

224
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:18,173
I'm Max Fischer.

225
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:20,783
- Hi.
- Hi.

226
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:28,349
- Come on, come on. File out.
- Sign here, please.

227
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:30,480
- Sic transit gloria.
- All right, all right.

228
00:15:38,264 --> 00:15:40,395
In summation,
I have only one question:

229
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:43,265
Is Latin dead?

230
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:51,528
Why don't you just piss off,
Fischer, you dotty skid mark?

231
00:15:51,614 --> 00:15:53,527
Was that Latin?

232
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:03,182
Never in my wildest
imagination -

233
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:06,660
- did I ever dream I would have
sons like these.

234
00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:11,357
What's your dad do, Max?

235
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,532
He's a neurosurgeon...
at, uh, St. Joseph's Hospital.

236
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:19,532
Personally, I could never see myself
cutting open somebody's brain, -

237
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:22,575
- but he seems to enjoy it.

238
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:25,707
Oh, no, no, no. I got this one.

239
00:16:27,926 --> 00:16:30,186
So you were in Vietnam,
if I'm not mistaken?

240
00:16:30,186 --> 00:16:31,013
Yeah.

241
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,188
Were you in the shit?

242
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:37,884
Yeah, I was in the shit.

243
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,450
See you Sunday, Mr. Blume.

244
00:16:40,536 --> 00:16:43,188
- All right.
- What's on Sunday?

245
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:46,059
Oh, that's right.
The twins' birthday party.

246
00:16:46,103 --> 00:16:49,843
Do you want to come?

247
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:53,364
I'd love to, except I've already got
a previous obligation to attend to.

248
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:56,756
Yeah. Thanks for
the invitation, though.

249
00:16:58,627 --> 00:17:01,236
Come work for me.

250
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,323
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I-I-I could use someone like you.

251
00:17:07,715 --> 00:17:10,150
Look, I may not be rich, Mr. Blume.

252
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:13,281
My father may only be
a doctor, but we manage.

253
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:16,847
- One-twelves!
- Excuse me, Mr. Blume. Nice talking to you.

254
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:20,805
You're on the team?

255
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:22,806
I'm an alternate.

256
00:17:24,414 --> 00:17:26,848
How you doin'? Good to see you again.

257
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:39,286
Whoa. Neat.

258
00:18:56,561 --> 00:19:00,041
Miss Cross?

259
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:03,302
I thought I'd just let you know
as per our conversation, the other day...

260
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:06,129
- Latin?
- Right. The Romance languages.

261
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:08,998
- Well, I gave a little speech.
- I heard about this.

262
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,607
Oh, you did?

263
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:14,304
I understand you made a
very convincing argument.

264
00:19:14,391 --> 00:19:17,130
I just thought you'd be pleased -

265
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,826
- to hear they're gonna
continue the Latin program.

266
00:19:19,913 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm very impressed.

267
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:25,001
Well, thank you very much.

268
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:27,349
Hey, you need an assistant?

269
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:30,002
Do we get to have an
assistant around here?

270
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,176
No, I doubt it.

271
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:33,655
I'm on scholarship, though...
academic scholarship, -

272
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:36,351
- so I get to do odd jobs and...

273
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:39,004
Say, how did you decide
to teach at Rushmore?

274
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:41,004
My husband went here.

275
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:48,006
I, uh... I didn't know
you were married.

276
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:50,005
Well, he's dead now.

277
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:52,006
So I'm not, actually.

278
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:54,180
When did he die?

279
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:56,181
Last year.

280
00:19:57,747 --> 00:19:59,703
My mother's dead.

281
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,704
I'm sorry to hear that.

282
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,704
She died when I was seven.

283
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,879
I guess we both have
dead people in our families.

284
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,880
What's going on in here?

285
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:20,272
These were just born.

286
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:26,230
I don't want alloys. I want steel.

287
00:20:26,273 --> 00:20:29,883
I don't give a rat's ass what he says.

288
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,232
Steel, Harry.

289
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:37,188
So you've changed your
mind, and you want the job?

290
00:20:37,797 --> 00:20:40,233
No, but I've got an idea,
and I need some money.

291
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,886
What Rushmore
needs is an aquarium -

292
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:45,582
- a first-class aquarium...
where the scientists can lecture -

293
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:48,755
- and the students can observe the
marine life in its natural habitat.

294
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,582
I don't know. What
do you think, Ernie?

295
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,540
An aquarium?

296
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:52,888
What kind of fish?

297
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:55,584
Barracudas, stingrays,
electric eel, trout, -

298
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,584
- hammerheads, piranhas,
giant squid, octopi...

299
00:20:58,671 --> 00:20:59,975
Piranhas? Really?

300
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:02,672
Yes, I'm talking to
a guy in South America.

301
00:21:02,716 --> 00:21:04,455
What'd Guggenheim say?

302
00:21:04,455 --> 00:21:06,195
Nothing. I felt I
should go to you first.

303
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:08,368
Why?

304
00:21:08,455 --> 00:21:12,194
Because at this moment, I feel the
best strategy is to keep it low profile.

305
00:21:12,282 --> 00:21:15,196
The more preparation work I can do,
the stronger our case will be -

306
00:21:15,283 --> 00:21:18,240
- when we take it to the administration.
- How much money do you want?

307
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:22,545
Thirty-five thousand dollars,
for the initial plans.

308
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:33,851
I'll give you 2.500.

309
00:21:33,937 --> 00:21:35,982
Okay.

310
00:22:24,296 --> 00:22:26,253
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

311
00:23:02,737 --> 00:23:06,347
- Max.
- Mm-hmm?

312
00:23:06,434 --> 00:23:09,999
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

313
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:14,435
Has it ever crossed your mind
that you're far too young for me?

314
00:23:19,436 --> 00:23:23,871
It crossed my mind that you might
consider that a possibility. Yeah.

315
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:26,046
Quite apart from the fact
that you're a student...

316
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:29,047
I'm not trying to pressure you
into anything, Miss Cross.

317
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,916
I'm surprised you
brought it up so bluntly.

318
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,090
I just want to make sure...

319
00:23:35,786 --> 00:23:38,787
- We've become friends, haven't we?
- Yes.

320
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,831
Good.

321
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,222
And, um... -

322
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:46,527
- the... the truth is, neither one of us
has the slightest idea -

323
00:23:46,615 --> 00:23:48,572
- where this relationship is going.

324
00:23:48,658 --> 00:23:52,443
- We can't predict the future.
- We don't have a relationship, Max.

325
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:55,399
- But we're friends.
- Yes, and that's all we're going to be.

326
00:23:55,443 --> 00:23:58,051
That's all I meant by "relationship".

327
00:23:58,138 --> 00:24:00,139
You want me to grab a dictionary?

328
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:03,661
No, I just want to make sure
that we understand each other.

329
00:24:03,749 --> 00:24:05,662
I understand.

330
00:24:05,748 --> 00:24:08,662
You're not attracted to me.

331
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:11,098
C'est la vie.

332
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:14,360
Max, you're 15 years old.

333
00:24:14,402 --> 00:24:16,968
Attraction doesn't enter into it.

334
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:19,664
If you say so.

335
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:22,012
Look, all I'm getting at is that -

336
00:24:23,926 --> 00:24:27,535
- that I've never met anyone like you.

337
00:24:29,275 --> 00:24:31,884
So you can take that
for whatever it's worth.

338
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:38,711
I think I can safely say
I've never met anyone like you either.

339
00:24:42,277 --> 00:24:44,451
You haven't, have you?

340
00:24:46,844 --> 00:24:49,452
Want to shake hands?

341
00:24:50,496 --> 00:24:52,887
I'm glad we had this conversation.

342
00:24:52,975 --> 00:24:54,888
So am I.

343
00:24:56,757 --> 00:24:58,541
I can't wear a wire.
They're feeling me up every day.

344
00:24:58,629 --> 00:25:01,716
Oh, come on, Frank.
You'll have complete protection.

345
00:25:01,802 --> 00:25:03,672
Yeah, I've heard that one before.

346
00:25:03,716 --> 00:25:05,803
- I gotta put a dime in the meter.
- Sit down, Frank.

347
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,152
Joe, go put a dime in the meter
for Officer Serpico.

348
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:11,457
Look, Serpico, if you agree
to testify in open court...

349
00:25:11,457 --> 00:25:12,066
No!

350
00:25:12,152 --> 00:25:15,892
- No, what?
- No, I'm not gonna testify.

351
00:25:15,978 --> 00:25:17,979
Go, go, go.

352
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:22,024
I'll expect your gun
and your badge on my desk...

353
00:25:22,068 --> 00:25:24,502
- Promise me one thing, O'Reilly.
- Name it.

354
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,851
That you're gonna follow this thing
all the way to the end -

355
00:25:26,938 --> 00:25:28,894
- of the line... where I got to be.

356
00:25:28,938 --> 00:25:31,199
So help me God.

357
00:25:31,243 --> 00:25:33,853
- Someone coming out of the building.
- I've got something!

358
00:25:33,939 --> 00:25:36,374
- Wait. This could be it.
- There's action across the street.

359
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:39,157
- Yeah, it's him.
- It's Snowman.

360
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:43,681
- He's getting on the "L" train!
- Take him!

361
00:25:45,985 --> 00:25:48,202
- What happened to the cannoli line?
- Max...

362
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,289
You're supposed to say, -

363
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:51,376
- "Forget about it, Sanchez.
The old man likes his cannolis."

364
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,030
Look, I made a mistake, all right?
It didn't make any difference anyway.

365
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:56,856
Hey, I'm letting it go,
but don't say it doesn't matter.

366
00:25:56,944 --> 00:25:59,552
- Every line matters.
- Get off my back!

367
00:25:59,596 --> 00:26:01,553
Don't fuck with my play!

368
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:03,640
- You fucking cocksucker...
- Hey, break it up. Break it up.

369
00:26:03,726 --> 00:26:06,075
I'm gonna kill you.

370
00:26:13,077 --> 00:26:15,642
Max. Max.

371
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,256
I thought the acting tonight
was excellent.

372
00:26:42,256 --> 00:26:43,169
Thanks.

373
00:26:43,256 --> 00:26:45,691
Well, it was better in rehearsals.

374
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:48,693
I'll catch up with you later, Dad.
I got a dinner to go to.

375
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:52,214
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Cast and crew only.

376
00:26:52,258 --> 00:26:55,345
- Oh. You need some money?
- No, Dad.

377
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:01,042
- Well, how was the slap?
- It was good.

378
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:04,652
- There he is. Max, that was great.
- I'm so glad you could come.

379
00:27:04,694 --> 00:27:07,652
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Peter Flynn, Max Fischer.

380
00:27:07,695 --> 00:27:10,130
- Hi.
- Who's this guy?

381
00:27:11,566 --> 00:27:12,435
Peter.

382
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:16,479
I really liked your
play. It was really cool.

383
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:20,479
- Yeah.
- What happened to your nose?

384
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:23,829
- I got punched in the face.
- Oh, boy.

385
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:27,308
- What's your excuse?
- Hey, author.

386
00:27:27,351 --> 00:27:29,308
- How you doing?
- Nice job.

387
00:27:29,351 --> 00:27:31,482
- Thank you.
- Gonna get to meet your dad tonight?

388
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:33,483
Oh, no. The old man's on call.

389
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,527
Mr. Blume, I'd like you
to meet Miss Cross -

390
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,527
- and I didn't catch this young
gentleman's name.

391
00:27:38,614 --> 00:27:42,528
I like your nurse's uniform, guy.

392
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:44,659
These are O.R. Scrubs.

393
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:49,181
"O.R." they?

394
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:52,660
Well, they're totally
inappropriate for the occasion.

395
00:27:52,747 --> 00:27:54,139
Well, I didn't know
we were going to dinner.

396
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:57,357
That's because you weren't invited.

397
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:58,618
Take it easy, Max.

398
00:27:58,618 --> 00:28:00,836
You were the one that
ordered him a whiskey and soda.

399
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,835
So what's wrong with that?

400
00:28:02,923 --> 00:28:07,968
I can write a hit play. Why can't I have
a little drink to unwind myself?

401
00:28:09,924 --> 00:28:12,316
So, tell me, curly,
how do you know Miss Cross?

402
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,620
- We went to Harvard together.
- Oh, that's great.

403
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:16,664
I wrote a hit play
and directed it.

404
00:28:16,707 --> 00:28:18,665
So I'm not sweating it either.

405
00:28:18,709 --> 00:28:20,666
Can we get a check, please?

406
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:22,970
- What do you think you're doing?
- Getting the check.

407
00:28:23,057 --> 00:28:24,970
No, you're not. Excuse me.

408
00:28:25,057 --> 00:28:27,144
I just want to thank you
for accommodating us.

409
00:28:27,232 --> 00:28:29,320
You see, we only thought
we were going to be three, -

410
00:28:29,406 --> 00:28:32,841
- but, uh, someone invited
himself along, so I apologize.

411
00:28:32,885 --> 00:28:35,886
- Quite all right, sir. Very well.
- Okay.

412
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:37,929
You're being rude, Max.

413
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,930
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

414
00:28:40,016 --> 00:28:42,974
No, I'm not. I'm just trying to figure out
why you brought this gentleman to my play -

415
00:28:43,061 --> 00:28:45,844
- and my dinner,
which was invitation only.

416
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,626
Would you like me to
pass you the creamer, Doc?

417
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,757
Yes, please.

418
00:28:49,844 --> 00:28:53,845
- What is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with you?

419
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:56,498
You hurt my feelings!
This night was important to me!

420
00:28:56,585 --> 00:28:59,934
How did I hurt your feelings?

421
00:28:59,976 --> 00:29:04,370
Oh, my God!
I wrote a hit play!

422
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,457
And I'm in love with you.

423
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:21,633
Put that a little bit there.

424
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:44,507
- Hi.
- Were you hiding over there?

425
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,986
Uh, I didn't want
to disrupt class.

426
00:29:49,552 --> 00:29:51,509
What's that you're painting?

427
00:29:51,595 --> 00:29:54,856
That's a... a jellyfish.

428
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,508
What can I do for you, Mr. Blume?

429
00:29:57,596 --> 00:30:00,032
Max wants to talk to you.

430
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:03,858
- What for?
- To apologize, I think.

431
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,336
Should we talk over here?

432
00:30:07,902 --> 00:30:09,860
He sent you?

433
00:30:09,947 --> 00:30:12,034
Yeah.

434
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:14,339
Are you his messenger?

435
00:30:14,425 --> 00:30:17,861
No, I'm his friend.

436
00:30:17,947 --> 00:30:22,514
You were right.
I should not have allowed him to drink.

437
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:27,863
I don't think
I should see Max anymore.

438
00:30:27,949 --> 00:30:29,950
Well, he's not gonna like
the sound of that.

439
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,212
No. No, I know, but...

440
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:36,560
I think I let him
get too attached.

441
00:30:36,603 --> 00:30:38,690
What do you think?

442
00:30:38,778 --> 00:30:42,039
Well, I think
you did your best.

443
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,214
Tell him I'm sorry.

444
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,564
Okay.

445
00:30:57,477 --> 00:31:00,391
What is your first name?

446
00:31:00,477 --> 00:31:04,521
Rosemary. What's yours?

447
00:31:04,565 --> 00:31:06,653
Herman.

448
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:13,131
He wrote you a letter.

449
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:14,828
Dear Miss Cross,

450
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:17,350
I would like to take this opportunity
to formally apologize -

451
00:31:17,437 --> 00:31:19,872
- for the events of the night
of the 23rd.

452
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:22,699
I'm not accustomed
to drinking alcohol.

453
00:31:22,742 --> 00:31:27,003
Please do me the service of coming to the
unveiling of a new venture I've undertaken.

454
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:29,526
I hope you will attend,
if possible.

455
00:31:29,614 --> 00:31:33,396
I remain your friend, Max Fischer.

456
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:42,877
Cut the music and no more pictures.

457
00:31:42,963 --> 00:31:44,876
- What time is it, Alan?
- 1:15.

458
00:31:44,964 --> 00:31:47,877
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Hey, lay off the chips, Buchan.

459
00:31:47,964 --> 00:31:49,877
Did you see her?

460
00:31:49,965 --> 00:31:52,226
- She's not here.
- Well, go check her classroom.

461
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,922
Shall I go ahead and
take care of this tree?

462
00:31:53,922 --> 00:31:54,705
Let's wait a few minutes.

463
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:57,400
- What's going on here, Maxie?
- Oh, hey, Coach Beck. Good to see you.

464
00:31:57,444 --> 00:31:59,401
This is where we're
putting in the new aquarium.

465
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:01,403
I'm in charge of the committee,
if you can believe it.

466
00:32:01,445 --> 00:32:04,011
This is my baseball diamond.

467
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:08,229
Yeah, I know, and I believe
it's being relocated a few feet over.

468
00:32:08,316 --> 00:32:10,663
Is it true the aquarium
will have piranhas?

469
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:12,230
Where did you hear that?

470
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,666
- My source indicated
that it was a possibility.

471
00:32:14,752 --> 00:32:17,492
Yes, it's true, but piranhas
are a very tricky species.

472
00:32:17,578 --> 00:32:20,361
- Max?
- Excuse me, George.

473
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,362
- Bad news.
- What's the story?

474
00:32:22,405 --> 00:32:24,668
- She had a substitute teacher today.
- Why?

475
00:32:24,754 --> 00:32:26,058
I guess she got sick.

476
00:32:26,058 --> 00:32:28,189
You know she's not sick.
Give me the phone.

477
00:32:32,277 --> 00:32:34,537
Janet, Max Fischer.
Is Mr. Blume there?

478
00:32:34,582 --> 00:32:38,017
Well, where is he?

479
00:32:38,104 --> 00:32:40,453
Goddamn it.
He's supposed to be here.

480
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:42,714
- I don't give a shit
about the barracudas, -

481
00:32:42,757 --> 00:32:45,714
- but, fuck it, I'm building it anyway.

482
00:32:45,758 --> 00:32:48,019
Max!

483
00:32:48,106 --> 00:32:50,715
Where are those damn chain saws
coming from?

484
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:52,715
- He's right over there!
- Max!

485
00:32:52,802 --> 00:32:54,890
- Max!
- Oh, hello, Dr. Guggenheim.

486
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:57,543
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- We're having a fund-raiser for the...

487
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,195
Turn that damn thing off!

488
00:33:00,283 --> 00:33:02,152
Tell me this isn't happening.

489
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:05,283
Dr. Guggenheim, I'd rather not have
this conversation in front of my crew.

490
00:33:28,243 --> 00:33:31,853
...chapter seven.

491
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:36,028
One more thing.
We have a new student with us today.

492
00:33:36,072 --> 00:33:39,115
His name's Max Fischer,
and he's actually asked -

493
00:33:39,202 --> 00:33:42,116
- to say a few words to the class.

494
00:33:42,204 --> 00:33:45,030
Max, you want to take it away?

495
00:33:45,116 --> 00:33:48,203
Sure. Thanks very much.

496
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,378
I just wanted to introduce myself.

497
00:33:56,945 --> 00:33:58,858
I'm Max Fischer.

498
00:33:58,945 --> 00:34:01,728
I'm a former student
of Rushmore Academy, -

499
00:34:01,771 --> 00:34:04,468
- which I recently got expelled from.

500
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,990
This is my first time
in a public school.

501
00:34:09,077 --> 00:34:12,642
I know you probably think I was born
with a silver spoon in my mouth, -

502
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,643
- but I'm no elitist.

503
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,340
I think you've got
some great facilities, -

504
00:34:17,384 --> 00:34:20,080
- and I'm really looking forward to making
the best of it here at Grover Cleveland.

505
00:34:21,384 --> 00:34:23,341
One footnote.

506
00:34:23,384 --> 00:34:25,645
I notice you don't have
a fencing team.

507
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:28,734
Well, I'm gonna try my hardest
to start one up for you guys.

508
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,343
- Max?
- Yes?

509
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:39,171
Hi, I'm Margaret Yang.
I'm in Mrs. Whitney's class.

510
00:34:39,257 --> 00:34:41,692
I just wanted to tell you
that I liked your speech.

511
00:34:41,692 --> 00:34:42,518
Thank you.

512
00:34:42,606 --> 00:34:46,867
I don't think I've ever heard of anyone
asking to give a speech in class before.

513
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,999
No? How unfortunate.

514
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:51,868
The silver spoon remark
might rub some people the wrong way, -

515
00:34:51,911 --> 00:34:53,868
- but I think I know...
- What do you mean?

516
00:34:53,912 --> 00:34:55,869
- Well...
- You know what?

517
00:34:55,955 --> 00:34:59,391
I gotta go into class in here.
I'll see you later, Mrs. Chang.

518
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,827
En garde!

519
00:35:14,524 --> 00:35:16,568
Janet, Max Fischer. Is he in?

520
00:35:20,438 --> 00:35:22,482
Yeah?

521
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,830
Okay.

522
00:35:24,918 --> 00:35:26,831
Hey, Max, how's it going?

523
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:29,483
Terrible. Tell me something. When you
talked to Miss Cross the other day...

524
00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:31,484
Do you have a telephone pass?

525
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:35,615
- Excuse me. Do you have a telephone pass?
- One second.

526
00:35:35,702 --> 00:35:37,528
I gotta tell ya, I don't
know what you see in her.

527
00:35:37,528 --> 00:35:39,355
I don't think she's right for you.

528
00:35:39,399 --> 00:35:41,007
What's that supposed to mean?

529
00:35:43,747 --> 00:35:45,835
I mean, she's not
that beautiful.

530
00:35:45,922 --> 00:35:49,269
She's not that intriguing.

531
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,792
I mean, she has something that
you can't put your finger on, but...

532
00:35:52,836 --> 00:35:55,706
Look, Mr. Blume, your comments are
valuable, but let's get to the point.

533
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,706
- Son?
- Will she see me again, yes or no?

534
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,533
- No.
- Hang on.

535
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,794
I'm talking on the telephone.

536
00:36:04,881 --> 00:36:06,795
Oh, come on.

537
00:36:06,882 --> 00:36:08,969
That's rude.

538
00:36:24,493 --> 00:36:26,450
Hey, Fischer.

539
00:36:26,538 --> 00:36:29,451
You better beat it, sonny.

540
00:36:29,538 --> 00:36:32,452
You know, Fischer,
I've been watching you.

541
00:36:32,538 --> 00:36:35,974
Showboat. Always talkin'.

542
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:40,497
Picking a kid like Dirk because his mother's
a great piece, and then getting nowhere.

543
00:36:40,584 --> 00:36:42,715
Like everything you do.

544
00:36:42,758 --> 00:36:45,845
Big show. No results.

545
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:49,671
What do you call getting a hand job from
Mrs. Calloway in the back of her Jaguar?

546
00:36:49,759 --> 00:36:52,717
A fucking lie.

547
00:36:52,803 --> 00:36:57,326
You think I got kicked out
for just the aquarium? Nah.

548
00:36:57,413 --> 00:37:01,021
It was the hand job.
You want to know something else?

549
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:02,935
It was worth it.

550
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:08,111
I'm sorry I embarrassed you at dinner.

551
00:37:08,197 --> 00:37:11,980
And please apologize
to what's-his-name for me.

552
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:16,112
I will. You okay?

553
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,634
Yeah, I'm fine,
but I miss Rushmore.

554
00:37:19,721 --> 00:37:22,287
I miss the seasons.

555
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,157
Watching the leaves change.

556
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:27,984
By the way, what time
does the library close?

557
00:37:28,027 --> 00:37:31,332
I've got an overdue book
to turn in.

558
00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:40,334
That is your handwriting,
isn't it?

559
00:37:41,508 --> 00:37:43,465
My husband gave me this book -

560
00:37:43,551 --> 00:37:46,465
- when he came to visit England
when I was 13 and he went to Rushmore.

561
00:37:46,552 --> 00:37:49,379
So when he died,
I gave it to the library here.

562
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:54,683
You remind me of him, you know?

563
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:57,163
I do?

564
00:37:57,249 --> 00:37:59,337
How?

565
00:37:59,425 --> 00:38:02,294
Well... -

566
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:05,947
- you were a member of
the Rushmore Beekeepers, weren't you?

567
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,773
Yeah. I was president of them.

568
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,122
He founded that club.

569
00:38:18,384 --> 00:38:21,472
Do you think we can be
friends again, Miss Cross?

570
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:25,951
- In-In a strictly platonic way?
- Of course I do.

571
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:30,299
Do you think you can make a go of it
and settle down at Grover Cleveland?

572
00:38:30,386 --> 00:38:34,301
Yeah, but I need a tutor.

573
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,311
Fighting Owls, let's go!

574
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,095
Let's go!

575
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:53,011
Okay, what else do we got?

576
00:39:53,097 --> 00:39:55,489
- Alan's got the birds for your approval.
- I'll take the green one.

577
00:39:55,576 --> 00:39:58,011
- And here's the knife.
- That's too fake.

578
00:39:58,054 --> 00:40:00,490
- Hi, Max.
- Hello.

579
00:40:02,752 --> 00:40:04,665
What's your name again?

580
00:40:04,752 --> 00:40:06,665
- Margaret Yang.
- Margaret Yang.

581
00:40:06,752 --> 00:40:08,665
What are you doing seventh period,
Margaret Yang?

582
00:40:08,752 --> 00:40:11,840
- I have guitar lessons.
- Classical guitar or... In what school?

583
00:40:11,926 --> 00:40:12,754
Rock.

584
00:40:12,754 --> 00:40:15,188
Ro... That's good.
We can get you out of that.

585
00:40:15,232 --> 00:40:17,667
Could I see you without
your glasses on, please?

586
00:40:19,232 --> 00:40:21,668
Let's put Margaret down for 3:30
in the auditorium, Woody.

587
00:40:21,754 --> 00:40:24,016
Thank you.

588
00:40:24,103 --> 00:40:26,190
And-And bring
a head shot, please.

589
00:40:37,932 --> 00:40:40,541
Hello, Herman.

590
00:40:40,584 --> 00:40:42,454
- How are you, Rosemary?
- I'm fine, thanks.

591
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:47,412
I just got home,
and I'm having a little snack.

592
00:40:47,456 --> 00:40:51,586
- Having some carrots?
- Yeah.

593
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:54,891
Nice house.

594
00:40:54,935 --> 00:41:00,196
Yeah. Um, it isn't mine.
I'm just sort of house-sitting.

595
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:05,241
Um... you were
in the neighborhood?

596
00:41:05,328 --> 00:41:09,155
Uh... did Max have something
planned for us today?

597
00:41:09,242 --> 00:41:12,155
A trip to the museum
or something?

598
00:41:12,243 --> 00:41:15,808
No, I don't think so.
I- I think he's rehearsing tonight.

599
00:41:15,895 --> 00:41:18,765
Oh, that's right.
He's doing his new play.

600
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,505
Yeah, he's really making a go of it
over there at Grover Cleveland.

601
00:41:21,592 --> 00:41:23,853
Yeah, he's doing very well,
isn't he?

602
00:41:26,897 --> 00:41:30,158
Do you want a carrot?

603
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:32,246
Yeah, I'll have one of those.

604
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:36,029
Thank you.

605
00:41:47,161 --> 00:41:49,510
Well, I'll probably
be seeing you soon.

606
00:41:52,032 --> 00:41:55,989
Or we could go for a walk now,
if you like.

607
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:06,905
Sure.

608
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:11,166
The weather's nice, isn't it?

609
00:42:11,209 --> 00:42:14,296
A little brisk.

610
00:42:14,384 --> 00:42:17,646
I'll just get a sweater.
I'll be back in a minute.

611
00:42:48,435 --> 00:42:50,348
Dirk?

612
00:42:50,435 --> 00:42:53,956
I know about you
and the teacher.

613
00:43:03,698 --> 00:43:08,481
- Does Max know?
- No, and I don't want him to know, ever.

614
00:43:08,525 --> 00:43:11,004
I just want it
to stop right now.

615
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,351
You're a married man, Blume, -

616
00:43:13,395 --> 00:43:16,613
- and you're supposed
to be his friend.

617
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,266
Look, Dirk, I am his friend.

618
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:21,657
Oh, yeah. And with friends
like you, who needs friends?

619
00:43:35,877 --> 00:43:37,660
Unlock it!

620
00:43:41,922 --> 00:43:44,183
Little Calloway.

621
00:43:49,402 --> 00:43:51,662
You're standing up
for the wrong guy.

622
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,663
Fischer ain't your mate.

623
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,707
What are you talking about, Buchan?

624
00:43:55,751 --> 00:43:57,708
He thinks your mom's good for a bonk.

625
00:43:57,752 --> 00:44:00,839
That's the only reason he picked you
as his chapel partner.

626
00:44:00,925 --> 00:44:04,143
- Who sold you that crock?
- He told me himself.

627
00:44:04,187 --> 00:44:08,623
He says she gave him a hand job
in the backseat of her bloody Jaguar.

628
00:44:10,536 --> 00:44:14,145
- Max would never say that.
- Yeah.

629
00:44:14,188 --> 00:44:16,145
I suppose you're right.

630
00:44:16,189 --> 00:44:18,277
After all, the son of a brain doctor -

631
00:44:18,277 --> 00:44:20,320
- doesn't need to impress
anybody now, does he?

632
00:44:22,365 --> 00:44:25,626
The killings gotta stop, esse.
It's getting too loco.

633
00:44:25,712 --> 00:44:28,148
- No more gats.
- Nigger, you're the crazy one.

634
00:44:28,234 --> 00:44:29,888
People be trying to
kill you.

635
00:44:29,888 --> 00:44:32,149
Are you talkin' about
you're gonna get rid of your gun?

636
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:35,671
It's time, homey.

637
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,671
Kiss me, Little Juan.

638
00:44:37,715 --> 00:44:39,976
All right, then he kisses her
and we're out. Okay.

639
00:44:40,064 --> 00:44:42,021
Is that for me?

640
00:44:42,107 --> 00:44:45,499
Dear Max, I am sorry to say
that I have secretly found out -

641
00:44:45,586 --> 00:44:48,499
- that Mr. Blume is having
an affair with Miss Cross.

642
00:44:48,587 --> 00:44:51,326
My first suspicions came when I saw them
Frenching in front of her house, -

643
00:44:51,414 --> 00:44:53,109
- and then I knew for
sure when they went -

644
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:54,805
- skinny-dipping in Mr.
Blume's swimming pool, -

645
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:58,675
- giving each other hand jobs while you
were taking a nap on the front porch.

646
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:01,458
Why am I telling you this now?

647
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:03,764
Because you're such a good friend.

648
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,937
Take care, pal.

649
00:45:06,025 --> 00:45:09,242
Fondly, Dirk Calloway.

650
00:45:09,372 --> 00:45:12,460
God.

651
00:45:14,374 --> 00:45:16,940
How was she, Herman?

652
00:45:17,027 --> 00:45:19,288
Jesus Christ.

653
00:45:19,374 --> 00:45:21,984
Was she good?
I bet she was.

654
00:45:22,028 --> 00:45:24,985
Although, I wouldn't know
because I never screwed her.

655
00:45:25,028 --> 00:45:29,290
Going skinny-dipping while I took a nap.

656
00:45:29,377 --> 00:45:32,464
"Are you comfortable, Max?
I'll just, uh, be out back, nude, -

657
00:45:32,551 --> 00:45:35,159
- getting hand jobs from the
woman you love."

658
00:45:35,203 --> 00:45:37,987
We never went skinny-dipping.

659
00:45:38,074 --> 00:45:40,336
Sure, you didn't.
And next you're gonna tell me -

660
00:45:40,378 --> 00:45:43,640
- you didn't just walk out of her house
at 2:00 in the morning.

661
00:45:46,901 --> 00:45:49,164
I'm in love with her.

662
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:54,164
Well, I was in love
with her first.

663
00:45:55,729 --> 00:46:00,340
And all that crap about,
"I don't think she's that great."

664
00:46:00,426 --> 00:46:02,295
"I don't think she's right
for you, Max."

665
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:04,775
That was all bullshit,
wasn't it?

666
00:46:06,688 --> 00:46:08,949
Do you think
she's in love with you?

667
00:46:10,689 --> 00:46:13,168
I don't know.

668
00:46:13,254 --> 00:46:17,473
Well, I guarantee you she's not,
and she never will be.

669
00:46:19,342 --> 00:46:21,300
Max.

670
00:46:24,213 --> 00:46:26,300
I saved Latin.

671
00:46:29,388 --> 00:46:31,650
What did you ever do?

672
00:46:34,215 --> 00:46:36,302
On the planet I come from -

673
00:46:36,389 --> 00:46:38,824
- the sun only comes out once a year.

674
00:46:41,389 --> 00:46:43,303
- That is why my skin...
- Excuse me.

675
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:47,870
I just came by to thank you
for wrecking my life.

676
00:46:52,957 --> 00:46:53,739
Max, what are you doing?

677
00:47:10,396 --> 00:47:12,613
Hello, Mrs. Blume.
This is Max Fischer.

678
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,744
I have some information regarding
your husband.

679
00:47:15,744 --> 00:47:18,093
Please return my call
on my voice mail:

680
00:47:18,093 --> 00:47:19,963
Grover Cleveland High
School, extension 23.

681
00:47:20,006 --> 00:47:22,441
Thank you very much.

682
00:47:25,354 --> 00:47:27,964
Thank you for meeting me.

683
00:47:28,008 --> 00:47:29,965
You're welcome.

684
00:47:31,704 --> 00:47:34,312
Would you like a sandwich?

685
00:47:35,878 --> 00:47:37,791
All right.

686
00:47:39,705 --> 00:47:44,488
I have a tuna
and peanut butter and jelly.

687
00:47:44,532 --> 00:47:46,489
Sorry it's not
something more exotic.

688
00:47:46,532 --> 00:47:49,315
- I'll take the tuna fish.
- Okay.

689
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:53,186
Milk or apple juice?

690
00:47:53,273 --> 00:47:55,620
Get to the point.

691
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:59,230
Okay.

692
00:47:59,274 --> 00:48:02,884
Your husband's...

693
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:13,233
How long will you be
staying with us, Mr. Blume?

694
00:48:13,233 --> 00:48:14,190
Indefinitely.

695
00:48:14,277 --> 00:48:16,886
- I'm being sued for divorce.
- Very good, sir.

696
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:19,364
Yo, shorty.

697
00:48:19,452 --> 00:48:21,365
Say, can you tell me
where the pool is located?

698
00:48:21,451 --> 00:48:23,713
I might want to take a dip
after I have dinner and hit the bar.

699
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:25,714
It's on the roof, sir.

700
00:51:03,047 --> 00:51:07,395
He's about five foot three,
112 pounds, -

701
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:11,484
- black hair, glasses, oval face.

702
00:51:27,573 --> 00:51:30,182
Thanks for bailing me out, Dad.
Can you drop me off at Rushmore?

703
00:51:30,269 --> 00:51:33,575
- I gotta go get a teacher fired.
- I don't think that's wise, Max.

704
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,533
Whoa! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

705
00:51:47,621 --> 00:51:49,446
This is private property!
You're trespassing!

706
00:51:49,446 --> 00:51:50,447
What, are you crazy?

707
00:51:52,621 --> 00:51:54,621
Wait a minute!

708
00:51:54,664 --> 00:51:57,275
Stop!

709
00:51:57,361 --> 00:52:02,102
- Let's have a truce for a second.
- Wait! Truce! Truce!

710
00:52:11,581 --> 00:52:13,494
What's this all about?

711
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:17,320
Did you say my mom
gave you a hand job?

712
00:52:17,408 --> 00:52:19,452
- What?
- Did you say it?

713
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,671
Who told you
that goddamn lie?

714
00:52:22,757 --> 00:52:24,670
Never mind.
I know who said it.

715
00:52:24,758 --> 00:52:26,671
I think I'm gonna stick
a knife in his heart, -

716
00:52:26,757 --> 00:52:28,670
- then I'm gonna send him back to
Ireland in a body bag.

717
00:52:28,758 --> 00:52:30,672
He's from Scotland.

718
00:52:30,759 --> 00:52:34,846
Well, tell that stupid Mick he just
made my list of things to do today.

719
00:52:36,108 --> 00:52:38,716
I'm gonna pop a cap in his ass.

720
00:52:40,587 --> 00:52:43,544
So you received the package?

721
00:52:43,587 --> 00:52:45,544
Good.

722
00:52:45,588 --> 00:52:49,023
I just wanted to inform you
about what's going on.

723
00:52:52,111 --> 00:52:54,720
I never took you
for an informer, Max.

724
00:52:54,763 --> 00:52:57,372
What's that supposed to mean?

725
00:52:57,459 --> 00:52:59,720
"What's that supposed to mean?"

726
00:53:03,461 --> 00:53:07,070
She resigned this morning before
I even got your little snapshots.

727
00:53:07,156 --> 00:53:09,201
So your latest attempt
at sabotage backfired.

728
00:53:09,244 --> 00:53:12,332
But she's one of the best teachers
you've got. How could you let her go?

729
00:53:12,374 --> 00:53:15,029
- Why are you trying to get her fired?
- You stupid old fool!

730
00:53:15,115 --> 00:53:18,028
I'm trying to win her back!

731
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,989
Miss Cross?

732
00:53:36,075 --> 00:53:38,032
Hi, Max.

733
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,685
- Need any help?
- No, I have it.

734
00:53:47,947 --> 00:53:49,470
Oh, here, let me see.

735
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:52,208
No. Please. Look, I don't
think you should come in here.

736
00:53:53,252 --> 00:53:56,817
Look, I'm sorry
I hurt your feelings.

737
00:53:56,905 --> 00:54:00,862
I'm sorry I love your friend
instead of you, but...

738
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,167
Please, Max...

739
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:05,037
You honestly believe you
love Blume instead of me?

740
00:54:05,124 --> 00:54:06,428
Yes.

741
00:54:06,515 --> 00:54:09,081
Well, you'll have to forgive me
if I don't take your word for that.

742
00:54:09,167 --> 00:54:10,995
- Oh, stop.
- Miss Cross...

743
00:54:11,082 --> 00:54:14,386
Listen, if you don't stop,
I'm gonna lose it. I mean it! Don't...

744
00:54:14,386 --> 00:54:17,691
It's too late.

745
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:23,867
Wait. Please.

746
00:54:29,563 --> 00:54:31,520
I got kicked out
because of you.

747
00:54:31,563 --> 00:54:34,825
- No, you got kicked out...
- Rushmore was my life.

748
00:54:34,912 --> 00:54:38,173
- Now you are.
- No, I'm not.

749
00:54:40,087 --> 00:54:43,523
What do you really think
is gonna happen between us?

750
00:54:43,566 --> 00:54:46,567
Do you think
we're gonna have sex?

751
00:54:49,436 --> 00:54:51,871
That's a kind
of cheap way to put it.

752
00:54:51,915 --> 00:54:54,829
Not if you've ever
fucked before, it isn't.

753
00:54:57,438 --> 00:55:00,134
Oh, my God.

754
00:55:00,177 --> 00:55:03,569
How would you describe it
to your friends?

755
00:55:03,612 --> 00:55:05,570
Would you say
that you'd fingered me?

756
00:55:05,658 --> 00:55:08,831
Or maybe I could give you a hand job.
Would that put an end to all of this?

757
00:55:11,527 --> 00:55:14,484
Please get out of my classroom.

758
00:55:23,225 --> 00:55:25,660
Fresh are you, sporty, wee fuckup.

759
00:55:25,703 --> 00:55:27,661
Hey, Magnus.

760
00:55:27,705 --> 00:55:30,488
Got any good hand jobs lately?

761
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:37,488
Hey, Dirk! Look who's here.

762
00:55:37,576 --> 00:55:41,489
It's your stepfather, waiting
for your mom so that he can get a piece.

763
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:46,838
Your mind's as warped
as your ear, Buchan.

764
00:55:51,622 --> 00:55:54,187
Don't get nasty, brother.

765
00:56:11,843 --> 00:56:17,409
We got him, Dirk.
We got him.

766
00:56:32,542 --> 00:56:34,020
Max?

767
00:56:35,804 --> 00:56:37,848
Oh, hey, Mr. Blume.

768
00:56:41,544 --> 00:56:43,500
You said you wanted to meet?

769
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:47,110
W-When?

770
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:49,415
Right now.

771
00:56:49,459 --> 00:56:52,676
You said you wanted
to put an end to all this.

772
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:58,286
Oh, yeah. I, uh, was gonna try and
have that tree over there fall on you.

773
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:01,591
- That big one?
- Yup.

774
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:03,939
It would have flattened me
like a pancake.

775
00:57:04,026 --> 00:57:05,940
What stopped you?

776
00:57:07,027 --> 00:57:09,854
I don't know.
What's the point?

777
00:57:09,941 --> 00:57:11,854
She loves you.

778
00:57:26,857 --> 00:57:28,770
She's my Rushmore, Max.

779
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:33,076
Yeah, I know.
She was mine too.

780
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:39,654
Hello.

781
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:42,523
Hi, I was wondering
if Max was home.

782
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:47,393
He's not in.

783
00:58:56,004 --> 00:58:57,395
I'm sorry.

784
00:59:55,188 --> 00:59:58,146
Good night, Stan.
Merry Christmas.

785
00:59:58,233 --> 01:00:00,146
See you next time.

786
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:10,104
It's been nice having
your company here at the shop, Max.

787
01:00:10,191 --> 01:00:12,061
You put any more thought -

788
01:00:12,148 --> 01:00:15,322
- into giving school another shot?
- No.

789
01:00:17,149 --> 01:00:21,585
Max, I like being a barber.
I'm good at it.

790
01:00:21,629 --> 01:00:25,368
But I always thought
you'd try another line of work.

791
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:29,369
You talked about being
a senator or a diplomat.

792
01:00:29,456 --> 01:00:31,456
Pipe dreams, Dad.

793
01:00:31,499 --> 01:00:33,586
I'm a barber's son.

794
01:00:38,674 --> 01:00:40,632
See you at dinner.

795
01:01:00,244 --> 01:01:02,157
Hello, Dirk.

796
01:01:02,244 --> 01:01:05,201
- Hi, Max.
- What can I do for you?

797
01:01:05,289 --> 01:01:09,375
- I thought I might get a haircut.
- We're closed.

798
01:01:09,463 --> 01:01:14,334
Well, I just want to say
I'm sorry I threw rocks at you that day.

799
01:01:14,377 --> 01:01:16,725
But I guess I'll go now.

800
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,466
Merry Christmas.

801
01:01:27,554 --> 01:01:29,467
What in the hell's that?

802
01:01:47,122 --> 01:01:49,775
So, did you hear the news?

803
01:01:49,862 --> 01:01:53,776
I doubt it. I don't really
follow the news anymore.

804
01:01:53,818 --> 01:01:56,123
Dr. Guggenheim had a stroke.

805
01:01:57,385 --> 01:02:00,951
I'll send him a box of candy.

806
01:02:01,038 --> 01:02:03,560
Maybe you ought to go visit him.

807
01:02:11,431 --> 01:02:15,910
- Mrs. Guggenheim?
- Hello, Max. Come in.

808
01:02:21,042 --> 01:02:23,477
It's so good to see you.

809
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:29,434
Oh, these are glorious.
I'll put them in some water.

810
01:02:29,477 --> 01:02:32,130
Have a seat.

811
01:02:32,218 --> 01:02:34,958
Should I say hello to Dr. Guggenheim
or can he not hear me?

812
01:02:35,044 --> 01:02:36,957
No, he can hear you.

813
01:02:44,263 --> 01:02:48,786
Hey, old-timer.
It's, uh, Max Fischer.

814
01:02:50,003 --> 01:02:53,395
You probably can't hear me,
because... -

815
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:55,309
- I don't know if your brain
is damaged or...

816
01:02:55,309 --> 01:02:56,266
What do you want?

817
01:02:59,918 --> 01:03:04,657
Nelson?

818
01:03:07,746 --> 01:03:11,050
That's the first thing
he's said in ten days.

819
01:03:13,051 --> 01:03:15,008
Do you think he recognized me?

820
01:03:15,094 --> 01:03:19,357
- Oh, I don't think so.
- It's Fischer.

821
01:03:36,402 --> 01:03:38,622
See ya later. Bye.
Hope you feel better.

822
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,013
Hey, amigo.

823
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:48,361
So, who gave you the shiner?

824
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:51,406
Either Ronny or Donny.

825
01:03:51,493 --> 01:03:53,450
Can't tell the difference anymore.

826
01:03:54,928 --> 01:03:57,363
Well, whichever one it was
really clocked you.

827
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:59,537
Hmm.

828
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:02,626
Kids don't like it when
their parents get divorced.

829
01:04:02,669 --> 01:04:06,104
- I don't blame 'em.
- Neither do I.

830
01:04:20,628 --> 01:04:22,890
How is she?

831
01:04:22,976 --> 01:04:24,890
I really wouldn't know.

832
01:04:24,978 --> 01:04:28,587
- Why not?
- I haven't seen her in six weeks.

833
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:31,239
What happened?

834
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:34,022
She left?

835
01:04:34,066 --> 01:04:37,067
She's in love
with a dead guy anyway.

836
01:04:38,806 --> 01:04:40,763
Edward Appleby.

837
01:04:43,763 --> 01:04:46,242
You know, uh... -

838
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:48,634
- she's sweet, but she's fucked-up.

839
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:56,157
- Adis, muchacho.
- Hey, are you okay?

840
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:00,767
Mmm, I'm a little bit
lonely these days.

841
01:05:33,642 --> 01:05:35,991
Max?

842
01:05:36,034 --> 01:05:37,990
What are you doing here?

843
01:05:39,729 --> 01:05:42,166
I don't know. Jesus.
They came at me out of nowhere.

844
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:45,080
- It was... It was so sudden.
- What?

845
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:47,079
I'm sorry. Can I use your phone?

846
01:05:47,167 --> 01:05:50,949
- I just got hit by a car.
- Oh, my God. A-A-Are you okay?

847
01:05:51,037 --> 01:05:52,951
Hmm? What did you say?

848
01:05:53,037 --> 01:05:55,168
- Come inside.
- Thank you.

849
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:01,386
- I'm gonna get something for your head.
- Okay.

850
01:06:07,518 --> 01:06:09,475
So, this is where it all happens.

851
01:06:09,561 --> 01:06:12,606
- All what happens?
- I wouldn't know.

852
01:06:12,692 --> 01:06:15,998
So, why did you dump Blume?

853
01:06:16,085 --> 01:06:20,042
- That's none of your business.
- I know it's not.

854
01:06:20,129 --> 01:06:23,651
But I just got hit by a car,
and I'm a little confused right now.

855
01:06:23,738 --> 01:06:25,651
I mean, I thought
you dumped me for Blume.

856
01:06:25,738 --> 01:06:26,653
Then I hear...

857
01:06:26,653 --> 01:06:28,175
I never dumped you because
we were never going out.

858
01:06:28,261 --> 01:06:31,696
It would just help me
if you talked to me for a minute.

859
01:06:31,783 --> 01:06:33,697
Tell me what happened.

860
01:06:33,783 --> 01:06:37,611
Okay.

861
01:06:41,394 --> 01:06:45,916
Um, A: He's married.

862
01:06:45,959 --> 01:06:49,178
He hates himself.

863
01:06:49,265 --> 01:06:52,830
And C: Well,
he smashed up your bicycle, -

864
01:06:52,918 --> 01:06:57,397
- didn't he?
- My previous bicycle, yes.

865
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,224
Well, what sort of person
does something like that?

866
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:01,398
I don't know.

867
01:07:04,746 --> 01:07:07,702
War does funny things to men.

868
01:07:07,746 --> 01:07:11,877
He thinks you dumped him
because of Edward Appleby.

869
01:07:13,748 --> 01:07:15,661
What does that mean?

870
01:07:17,748 --> 01:07:22,967
Well, I mean, you live in his room,
with all his stuff. It's kind of...

871
01:07:25,445 --> 01:07:27,532
I was married to him.

872
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:31,055
- I know you were.
- Although, I will say -

873
01:07:31,141 --> 01:07:36,100
- that Edward has more spark
and character -

874
01:07:36,186 --> 01:07:38,143
- and imagination in one fingernail -

875
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:41,101
- than Herman Blume has
in his entire body.

876
01:07:43,535 --> 01:07:45,537
One dead fingernail.

877
01:07:49,928 --> 01:07:52,059
Right.

878
01:07:52,145 --> 01:07:55,059
One dead fingernail.

879
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:00,278
How did he die, by the way?

880
01:08:00,365 --> 01:08:03,409
He drowned.

881
01:08:04,974 --> 01:08:06,889
How did your mother die?

882
01:08:06,975 --> 01:08:09,758
She got cancer.

883
01:08:14,845 --> 01:08:18,890
Hold still for a moment, okay?

884
01:08:24,717 --> 01:08:27,413
You're very pretty.

885
01:08:27,457 --> 01:08:29,415
Thank you.

886
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:53,592
Is this fake blood?

887
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:58,028
Yes, it is.

888
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:01,898
You know, you and Herman
deserve each other.

889
01:09:03,464 --> 01:09:05,507
You're both little children.

890
01:09:07,856 --> 01:09:09,769
Let me show you the door.

891
01:09:09,855 --> 01:09:13,988
I'll just go back out the window.

892
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:30,859
- Good-bye, Miss Cross.
- Good-bye, Max.

893
01:09:48,776 --> 01:09:50,516
Hey.

894
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:54,907
I'm, uh...
I'm sorry about what I said -

895
01:09:54,951 --> 01:09:57,343
- about your mom giving me
a hand job.

896
01:09:57,386 --> 01:10:00,474
I know, Max.

897
01:10:00,518 --> 01:10:04,170
I'm sorry I didn't take your hand
when Buchan kicked your ass.

898
01:10:04,257 --> 01:10:07,257
Hey, uh, that's okay.

899
01:10:13,389 --> 01:10:16,129
What's that?

900
01:10:16,173 --> 01:10:20,348
I don't know.

901
01:10:34,046 --> 01:10:35,959
Nice landing.

902
01:10:39,915 --> 01:10:43,569
What's, uh... What's that you got there,
a little flight plan or something?

903
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:46,047
Hmm, pretty good.

904
01:10:46,091 --> 01:10:48,178
- Do you know Dirk Calloway?
- I don't think so.

905
01:10:48,265 --> 01:10:51,179
Dirk, this is Margaret Yang.

906
01:10:59,398 --> 01:11:03,398
I, uh, heard about your science project
on Action 13.

907
01:11:03,442 --> 01:11:05,052
They said the Navy wants
to buy it from you. That's...

908
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:06,008
No, not anymore.

909
01:11:07,225 --> 01:11:10,312
- Why not?
- Because it was a fake.

910
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,270
- What do you mean?
- I faked all the results.

911
01:11:13,357 --> 01:11:16,009
- Why?
- Because it didn't work.

912
01:11:16,097 --> 01:11:18,227
I thought it would,
but it didn't.

913
01:11:25,228 --> 01:11:28,099
You're a real jerk to me,
you know that?

914
01:11:29,882 --> 01:11:31,839
I'm sorry, Margaret.

915
01:11:31,882 --> 01:11:36,013
Well, anyway, nice to see you.

916
01:11:57,539 --> 01:11:59,931
Do you want to take over for a while?

917
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:26,892
Take dictation, please.

918
01:12:29,023 --> 01:12:34,023
Possible candidates
for Kite Flying Society.

919
01:12:34,111 --> 01:12:36,677
David Connors. Murray Marshall.

920
01:12:36,764 --> 01:12:39,677
Greg Holloway. Duncan Wright.

921
01:12:39,765 --> 01:12:42,329
Margaret Yang. Woody Jackson.
Shoeshine Pickens.

922
01:13:20,206 --> 01:13:23,120
- Thanks for meeting me, Mr. Blume.
- What can I do for you?

923
01:13:27,643 --> 01:13:29,860
What's this?

924
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:37,775
That's the Perfect Attendance Award
and the Punctuality Award.

925
01:13:37,862 --> 01:13:40,253
I got those at Rushmore.

926
01:13:40,297 --> 01:13:42,385
I thought you could choose
which one you like more -

927
01:13:42,472 --> 01:13:45,733
- and you could wear that one,
and I could wear the other.

928
01:13:49,037 --> 01:13:50,951
I'll take Punctuality.

929
01:13:52,342 --> 01:13:54,300
Okay.

930
01:13:54,343 --> 01:13:56,300
Come here.

931
01:14:05,215 --> 01:14:08,911
- Thank you.
- Come on inside.

932
01:14:13,086 --> 01:14:16,043
Well, well, well, well,
look what the cat dragged in.

933
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:18,695
Sorry I'm late.

934
01:14:18,783 --> 01:14:20,957
That's okay.

935
01:14:21,043 --> 01:14:23,000
I want you to meet someone.

936
01:14:23,044 --> 01:14:26,001
Mr. Blume,
this is my father, Bert Fischer.

937
01:14:29,785 --> 01:14:31,916
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Fischer.

938
01:14:32,002 --> 01:14:34,959
Now Mr. Fischer was my father's name.
Call me Bert, please.

939
01:14:35,046 --> 01:14:39,222
- Okay, Bert.
- So, Max tells me you need a haircut.

940
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:42,569
I can see that. Why don't you sit down,
and we'll have a look.

941
01:14:46,961 --> 01:14:48,919
Mm-hmm.

942
01:14:52,006 --> 01:14:53,963
I don't know, Bert.

943
01:14:54,006 --> 01:14:58,224
Don't worry, Mr. Blume.
It's a relatively painless procedure.

944
01:14:58,268 --> 01:15:01,051
Maybe we'll throw in a shave as well.

945
01:15:01,139 --> 01:15:04,443
Okay, are you fond
of that mustache?

946
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:09,052
Do you think you want to keep it
for a while? Mm-hmm.

947
01:15:09,139 --> 01:15:13,010
- How much are you worth, by the way?
- I don't know.

948
01:15:13,054 --> 01:15:15,141
- Over ten million?
- Yeah, I guess so.

949
01:15:15,184 --> 01:15:17,141
- Good, good.
- Why?

950
01:15:17,184 --> 01:15:19,750
'Cause we're gonna
need all of it.

951
01:16:28,763 --> 01:16:31,329
She's not coming, is she?

952
01:16:31,416 --> 01:16:34,330
Hmm, doesn't look good.

953
01:16:34,416 --> 01:16:36,938
But don't worry. Come on, Herman.

954
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:40,026
- Shit, what am I doing here?
- Hey!

955
01:16:40,113 --> 01:16:42,766
- Scatter. Scatter.
- Damn it!

956
01:16:42,809 --> 01:16:46,940
How in the hell did you ever
get so rich? You're a quitter, man!

957
01:16:47,026 --> 01:16:50,201
I paid $8 million for this.

958
01:16:52,203 --> 01:16:54,507
And that's all
you're prepared to spend?

959
01:17:03,987 --> 01:17:07,988
I'm, uh, sorry you couldn't make it to
our little groundbreaking the other day.

960
01:17:08,074 --> 01:17:11,771
It's kind of a shame,
since he's building it for you.

961
01:17:11,857 --> 01:17:16,163
Well, you know, I never asked anyone
to build me an aquarium.

962
01:17:16,207 --> 01:17:19,642
I'm not quite sure
how that rumor got started.

963
01:17:19,685 --> 01:17:22,511
Me neither.

964
01:17:22,599 --> 01:17:26,513
You think Edward Appleby
would have built one for you?

965
01:17:26,556 --> 01:17:29,382
Yeah, I think he would have,
if he'd had the money.

966
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:31,383
That's what I thought.

967
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:35,253
Blume's got a bit more spark and
vitality than you expected, doesn't he?

968
01:17:35,297 --> 01:17:39,515
I thought the aquarium
was your idea.

969
01:17:39,602 --> 01:17:41,515
Well, I gave it to my friend.

970
01:17:41,733 --> 01:17:44,255
- Fifteen sticks?
- Yes, please.

971
01:17:44,342 --> 01:17:48,082
And... could you make
the order out to... -

972
01:17:48,169 --> 01:17:50,430
- Ready Demolition,
Tucson, Arizona?

973
01:17:51,735 --> 01:17:54,430
Thank you very much.

974
01:17:58,737 --> 01:18:00,650
Make sure these don't get wet.

975
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:05,433
I'll see you at 3:15.

976
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,433
- Where are you going?
- Rushmore.

977
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,434
I've got one last piece
of unfinished business to attend to.

978
01:18:26,872 --> 01:18:30,219
- Fischer, you fuck!
- Hello, Magnus.

979
01:18:30,307 --> 01:18:32,221
I'd have shot you in the other ear, -

980
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:34,699
- but it got blown off
a long time ago.

981
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:39,308
- Besides, now we're even.
- Not for long, Kemo Sabe.

982
01:18:39,396 --> 01:18:42,396
We'll see. I got
a proposition for you.

983
01:18:42,482 --> 01:18:46,049
Well, you can stick it up
your mother's ass, you little prick.

984
01:18:46,137 --> 01:18:48,789
I gotta hand it to you, Magnus.

985
01:18:48,833 --> 01:18:50,788
You've got a way with words.

986
01:18:50,832 --> 01:18:52,833
You want to be in a play?

987
01:18:55,877 --> 01:18:57,834
What's all that shite?

988
01:18:59,965 --> 01:19:02,443
Nothing.

989
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:04,617
I just think
you're right for the part.

990
01:19:21,751 --> 01:19:25,012
I always wanted to be
in one of your fucking plays.

991
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:29,274
I know you did, mate.

992
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,494
This is gonna be exciting.
My son Max wrote it.

993
01:19:43,581 --> 01:19:47,016
Oh, boy, I gotta call the hospital.

994
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:49,539
Excuse me. Are you
Mrs. Whitney, the English teacher?

995
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:50,452
Yes.

996
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,453
Hi, I'm William Yang,
Margaret Yang's father.

997
01:19:52,539 --> 01:19:54,453
- This is my wife, Lucille.
- Nice to meet you.

998
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,583
- Hello.
- That's kid's gonna burn this place down.

999
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,975
You better believe it.

1000
01:19:57,975 --> 01:20:00,279
Well, the plans were never
formally submitted to the city.

1001
01:20:00,323 --> 01:20:02,281
- Were they supposed to be?
- I assume so.

1002
01:20:02,367 --> 01:20:04,933
- Too late now.
- Officers Brooks and Donovan -

1003
01:20:05,021 --> 01:20:07,282
- requesting additional units
at Grover Cleveland High School.

1004
01:20:07,368 --> 01:20:09,281
- Units responding identify.
- A program.

1005
01:20:09,369 --> 01:20:13,196
Let me look at that.
Turn it, turn it.

1006
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,196
That's enough.

1007
01:20:17,414 --> 01:20:20,197
- Excuse me. Right here.
- Thanks.

1008
01:20:24,154 --> 01:20:26,068
Hi, Herman.

1009
01:20:29,807 --> 01:20:32,372
Looks like Max
pulled a fast one on us.

1010
01:20:40,331 --> 01:20:42,983
Thank you very much.

1011
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:47,072
I don't usually do this,
but this play means a lot to me, -

1012
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:49,420
- and I wanted to make a dedication.

1013
01:20:49,506 --> 01:20:53,159
So, I'll just say that this play
is dedicated to the memory of my mother,

1014
01:20:53,246 --> 01:20:56,377
Eloise Fischer, -

1015
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:59,466
- and to Edward Appleby,
a friend of a friend.

1016
01:20:59,552 --> 01:21:03,161
Also, you'll find a pair
of safety glasses and some earplugs -

1017
01:21:03,248 --> 01:21:05,161
- underneath your seats.

1018
01:21:05,249 --> 01:21:08,815
Please feel free to use them.
Thank you very much.

1019
01:21:15,511 --> 01:21:17,598
Bravo Company, this is Tango 7.
Do you copy?

1020
01:21:17,685 --> 01:21:21,383
We order the military forces
of the United States to take action...

1021
01:21:21,469 --> 01:21:23,991
This is a different kind of war.

1022
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:27,382
We are making progress,
progress, progress, progress.

1023
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:41,213
How long you been
in country, soldier?

1024
01:21:41,255 --> 01:21:43,560
I ain't even here, Sergeant.

1025
01:21:43,604 --> 01:21:45,560
I'm in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

1026
01:21:45,604 --> 01:21:48,213
Right on, brother.

1027
01:21:50,387 --> 01:21:53,084
Hoo. Hoo-hoo.

1028
01:21:55,171 --> 01:21:58,780
Let's rock, Esposito!
I repeat, let's rock!

1029
01:21:58,867 --> 01:22:01,519
Let's rock and roll!

1030
01:22:36,004 --> 01:22:37,918
Fischer!

1031
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:42,440
I'm okay.
Go, go, go, go.

1032
01:22:42,527 --> 01:22:44,919
- Damn it!
- Take it easy, Dirk.

1033
01:22:45,006 --> 01:22:47,093
- How much time do we got, Wood?
- Two minutes.

1034
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:48,833
All right, bring me some more
ketchup very quickly, please.

1035
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:49,703
Effects!

1036
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:53,138
- This is gonna look stupid.
- No, it's not. It's gonna look real.

1037
01:23:10,401 --> 01:23:13,969
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1038
01:23:14,055 --> 01:23:16,099
Hold this one too, okay?

1039
01:23:19,491 --> 01:23:23,753
So, what do you think
of Max's latest opus?

1040
01:23:25,145 --> 01:23:27,058
It's good.

1041
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:32,666
But let's hope
it's got a happy ending.

1042
01:23:50,279 --> 01:23:54,888
- Adis, Esposito.
- Adis, Sarge.

1043
01:23:54,976 --> 01:23:58,889
Say a prayer for Surf Boy,
wherever he is.

1044
01:23:58,977 --> 01:24:03,021
Semper fi, soldier.
Semper fi,

1045
01:24:03,063 --> 01:24:05,585
Sic transit gloria.

1046
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:07,631
Maybe we'll meet again someday -

1047
01:24:07,673 --> 01:24:10,544
- when the fighting stops.

1048
01:24:13,414 --> 01:24:16,414
Tag 'em and bag 'em, cherries!
We're movin' out!

1049
01:24:31,896 --> 01:24:33,852
Hello, Esposito.

1050
01:24:38,201 --> 01:24:40,115
Will you marry me, Le-Chahn?

1051
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,637
You bet I will.

1052
01:24:57,769 --> 01:25:01,509
That's my son.
That's my Maxie.

1053
01:25:10,163 --> 01:25:12,989
I just didn't expect to see you here.

1054
01:25:13,077 --> 01:25:15,077
Did Max send you an invitation?

1055
01:25:15,165 --> 01:25:18,512
Yeah, and he told me to wear a tie.

1056
01:25:20,339 --> 01:25:24,602
- Congratulations, Max.
- Thank you very much, Mrs. Yang.

1057
01:25:24,688 --> 01:25:27,775
I, uh, actually wrote a different
version of the play two years ago, -

1058
01:25:27,863 --> 01:25:29,776
- but I couldn't get it done
over at Rushmore.

1059
01:25:29,862 --> 01:25:32,124
- Oh, really? Why?
- Too political?

1060
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:35,168
No, a kid got his finger blown off
during rehearsals.

1061
01:25:35,254 --> 01:25:38,169
A very good evening
to you, Fischers. Hi.

1062
01:25:38,256 --> 01:25:40,691
Miss Cross, I'd like for you
to meet my father, Bert Fischer.

1063
01:25:40,778 --> 01:25:43,865
He's a barber.
This is my friend, Rosemary Cross.

1064
01:25:43,952 --> 01:25:46,692
- Hello, Rosemary.
- Nice to meet you at last, Bert.

1065
01:25:46,779 --> 01:25:48,693
Of course you know Mr. Blume.

1066
01:25:48,779 --> 01:25:53,085
I'd also like everyone to meet
Mr. And Mrs. Yang. This is Margaret.

1067
01:25:53,171 --> 01:25:55,911
- Hello, Margaret.
- It's nice to meet you, Miss Cross.

1068
01:25:55,998 --> 01:25:58,216
I'm surprised they let him build
a real campfire on the stage.

1069
01:25:58,304 --> 01:26:00,217
It's clearly a safety hazard.

1070
01:26:00,303 --> 01:26:02,173
Well, last year,
he tried to raise piranhas.

1071
01:26:02,173 --> 01:26:03,738
Yeah, I know he did.

1072
01:26:03,782 --> 01:26:06,956
- What did you think, Mr. Littlejeans?
- Best play ever, man.

1073
01:26:09,522 --> 01:26:11,479
I thought it was
a very realistic performance.

1074
01:26:11,523 --> 01:26:14,523
Yeah? Fischer stepped
over half my bloody lines.

1075
01:26:14,610 --> 01:26:16,567
That's funny.
I didn't notice.

1076
01:26:16,653 --> 01:26:19,219
Mr. Blume, how are Ronny and Donny
enjoying military school?

1077
01:26:19,263 --> 01:26:21,872
- They love it.
- Lucky bastards.

1078
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:26,612
- I understand you're a neurosurgeon.
- No, I'm a barber.

1079
01:26:26,699 --> 01:26:29,482
But a lot of people make that mistake.

1080
01:26:34,527 --> 01:26:36,831
You were incredible tonight, Margaret.

1081
01:26:36,875 --> 01:26:40,092
- You were that poor girl.
- Thank you.

1082
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:43,877
I loved it when you grabbed onto the
bottom of the chopper as it was taking off.

1083
01:26:43,921 --> 01:26:45,876
- That was totally improvised.
- I know.

1084
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,877
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

1085
01:26:47,921 --> 01:26:50,443
Can you do
an Australian accent?

1086
01:26:50,486 --> 01:26:53,051
I'm working on something
that's set in the outback.

1087
01:26:53,095 --> 01:26:56,052
I really feel like celebrating,
you know?

1088
01:26:56,096 --> 01:26:59,618
- Would you care to dance?
- Oh, yes, I-I would love to.

1089
01:26:59,705 --> 01:27:01,662
- Great.
- Come on.

1090
01:27:01,705 --> 01:27:03,792
You're looking good, Bert.

1091
01:27:03,836 --> 01:27:06,185
Hello, Mr. Blume.

1092
01:27:06,272 --> 01:27:08,838
Hello, Margaret.
May I cut in?

1093
01:27:08,925 --> 01:27:11,881
I haven't had a chance to cut a rug
with your new girlfriend yet.

1094
01:27:11,969 --> 01:27:15,490
- Ah, new girlfriend.
- Yes, I am.

1095
01:27:15,577 --> 01:27:19,143
Find your own dance partner, Mr. Blume.
I'm spoken for.

1096
01:27:19,231 --> 01:27:23,449
No, it's okay.
He's my friend.

1097
01:27:29,059 --> 01:27:31,929
Well... you pulled it off.

1098
01:27:32,016 --> 01:27:35,625
Yeah, it went okay.
At least nobody got hurt.

1099
01:27:37,494 --> 01:27:39,408
Except you.

1100
01:27:41,409 --> 01:27:44,149
No, I didn't get hurt that bad.

1101
01:27:44,235 --> 01:27:47,670
Come on, you two. Shake a leg.

1102
01:27:50,019 --> 01:27:52,715
- Would you like to dance?
- Yeah, but...

1103
01:27:52,759 --> 01:27:55,020
Here, let's see if the deejay can play
something with a little more...

1104
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:55,889
Reuben!
