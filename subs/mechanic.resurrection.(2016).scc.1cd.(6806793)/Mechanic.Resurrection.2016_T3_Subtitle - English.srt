2
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,083
Five months in Brazil.

3
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,751
You're a hard man to find.

4
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,841
You even have the accent right.

5
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,221
I do say so.

6
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:44,475
The principal I represent
has an offer for you.

7
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,352
He would like three men killed.

8
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:48,855
Each death must look like an accident.

9
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:50,481
Your specialty, I believe.

10
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,864
Seems that reports of your demise
have been greatly exaggerated.

11
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:02,201
My principal could make that known
to certain... interested parties.

12
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:07,790
Which means that your new life here
would end rather quickly.

13
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,836
Or you can do the job
and go back to being dead.

14
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,548
What's your pleasure,
<i>Senhor</i> Otto Santos?

15
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:21,179
Let me make a call.

16
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:25,016
What are you doing?

17
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:30,271
Tell your principal it never pays
to fuck with the dead.

18
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:34,502
Get the fuck on the ground!

19
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:37,130
Get the fuck down!
Don't look at me!

20
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,156
- Bishop.
- Hello, Mei.

21
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,200
You're different.

22
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:54,577
Older.

23
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,996
Something more than that.

24
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,958
I need time to find someone
before they find me.

25
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:03,210
Then I'll be moving on.

26
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:04,962
Who else is here?

27
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:07,798
No one. Diving season's over.

28
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,133
Come.

29
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,968
Your home's waiting for you.

30
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:12,720
How was your trip?

31
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,180
It was okay.

32
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:19,226
It was a busy season.

33
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,688
But don't worry,
no one came near your home.

34
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:32,657
Nothing's changed.

35
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,949
Get some rest.

36
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:09,420
Hi. How can I help you?

37
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:10,755
Great, you speak English.

38
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,759
I'm running low on first aid.
I'm staying on the boat.

39
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:16,969
Sure.

40
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:22,516
This is all I have.

41
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:24,435
Thanks.

42
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:33,652
If I don't have what you need,
I can call our supply boat.

43
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:36,822
They can take you back
to Phuket to get it.

44
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:40,993
No, this is great.
Thanks so much.

45
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,161
Anytime.

46
00:11:56,717 --> 00:12:02,056
- ...don't fucking tease me!
- Frank-- help!

47
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,265
- Help!
- Bishop!

48
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,601
Bishop!

49
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,563
They're fighting. It's bad.

50
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,653
You want a piece of me?!

51
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:16,779
Stay down.

52
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:27,706
I've met her.
She has a backbone.

53
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,001
Women like that
get killed in these situations.

54
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,671
Domestic squabble, Mei.

55
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,297
Not my business.

56
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,385
You helped me once.

57
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:41,554
Help her.

58
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:44,139
Or I will do it.

59
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,021
Hold this.

60
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,434
Frank, get the fuck away from me!

61
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,519
Frank!

62
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:31,812
Not worth it.

63
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:34,815
Bitch!

64
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:39,987
Let her go.

65
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,488
Who the fuck are you?

66
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,991
Please, help me.

67
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:48,287
I said, let her go. Last chance.

68
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,331
Let go of me, Frank.

69
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:51,457
You don't want to do that.

70
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,250
Fuck you!

71
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:12,853
Is he dead?

72
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:21,320
Bishop.

73
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,408
Shit.

74
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,832
Take her ashore.
I'll deal with the boat.

75
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,000
Okay.

76
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,613
- Bishop.
- Where is she?

77
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,407
Sleeping. In your bungalow.

78
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,293
What's going on?

79
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,962
Gina Thornton. American.

80
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,922
- That's you, right?
- Yeah.

81
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:07,176
You're the second woman
who has my picture in her phone.

82
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,470
The first was working
for a guy called Crain.

83
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:11,805
Name ring a bell?

84
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,725
The only thing
you got right was my name.

85
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,351
The first woman was a messenger.

86
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,646
Is that what you are?

87
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,690
So what's the message?

88
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:22,983
I already told you--

89
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,735
Tell me about Crain.

90
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,278
What are you supposed to do for him?

91
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:27,529
Where is he?

92
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,244
Fine. I'll talk.

93
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,171
Look... I don't work for Crain.

94
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,715
That's the truth.
But he did send me.

95
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,675
Where is he?

96
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,719
- I don't know.
- Why are you here?

97
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,306
He has something on me.

98
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,557
I had no choice.

99
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,142
Right.

100
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,852
Any of his men nearby?

101
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,479
He didn't say, I didn't ask.

102
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,314
What about Frank?

103
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,440
Part of the setup.

104
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,776
Explain.

105
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,863
He was supposed to get mean,
I escape to this island.

106
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:11,490
It wasn't meant to be real.

107
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,909
But then Frank got drunk
and attacked me.

108
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,203
Crain wanted me to look like a victim.

109
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,830
And get next to me?

110
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,207
Yeah.

111
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,376
But Frank took his part too far.

112
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,087
So we meet. What next?

113
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,881
I use the cell and call
the pre-programmed number.

114
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:30,968
Let it ring once.
After that, I don't know.

115
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:34,137
My new girl gets kidnapped is what.

116
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:35,556
What?

117
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:37,432
The thought didn't cross your mind?

118
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:45,357
Okay, so you fall for me,
and Crain thinks he has leverage on you.

119
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,942
Why?

120
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,486
Well, to force me to do something
I don't want to do.

121
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,572
What is it that you do?

122
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:55,409
I'll make the call, not you.
I choose when they come.

123
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,494
Then I'll take Crain out.

124
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,998
No. I'm not going to help you kill anyone.

125
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,916
Do you really believe that Crain

126
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,544
lets the people he blackmails
into helping him, live?

127
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,549
I've spent my whole life
setting people up to die.

128
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,427
I can set you up to live.

129
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:39,286
My father was a doctor
of Eastern medicine.

130
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:40,746
He was a healer.

131
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:43,916
Bishop used to study with him.

132
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,418
To learn how to heal?

133
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:49,046
A man like him?

134
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,505
I thought so, too.

135
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,093
But my father understood

136
00:18:55,177 --> 00:19:00,933
that those who have been hurt the most
often have the greatest ability to heal.

137
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,072
<i>Eighteen months ago,</i>

138
00:19:57,197 --> 00:20:00,993
<i>special military operative, Gina Thornton,
left the war zone in Afghanistan</i>

139
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:04,079
<i>to offer humanitarian
assistance in Cambodia.</i>

140
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,124
<i>After my last deployment,
I just needed a change.</i>

141
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,961
<i>Too many innocent people
getting caught in the line of fire.</i>

142
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,213
<i>Rules of engagement
made it impossible to prevent.</i>

143
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:20,595
<i>And then, you know,
when I came to Phnom Penh, I, uh,</i>

144
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:23,515
<i>I don't know, it just felt right here.</i>

145
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:29,229
<i>And, um, I felt like I can maybe
do something good with my life.</i>

146
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,790
I can't afford any surprises.

147
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,542
Need to know what Crain has on you.

148
00:20:57,007 --> 00:21:01,053
I run a shelter for victims
of human trafficking in Cambodia.

149
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:05,182
There's always been an issue or two,
but I've managed to handle it.

150
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:12,439
A few weeks ago...
one of my staff members was kidnapped.

151
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:17,944
Two days later, she was thrown off a truck
at my front door.

152
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,947
Beaten. Died within an hour.

153
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:27,621
Crain sent this asshole, Jeremy,
who said it was just a taste

154
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:30,582
of what he'd do
to everyone at the shelter.

155
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:33,877
Including the children.

156
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,173
They are my weakness.
All the leverage Crain needed.

157
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:46,139
So, you see, I didn't have a choice.
I had to do what Crain wanted me to.

158
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,174
- What are you doing?
- Hold my hand.

159
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,301
It's for Crain's people.

160
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:05,802
They're watching.

161
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:06,887
Where?

162
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,307
Two men in the Zodiac.

163
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,600
Out in the ocean.

164
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,988
There you are.
Come on, you two.

165
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,907
You're gonna miss the best part.

166
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,825
Give me your hands.

167
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,666
Hold this, please.

168
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,668
- We can just get a drink and...
- No, you will not.

169
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,045
- You will stay right there.
- Mei...

170
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,589
- Thank you very much.
- What are you doing?

171
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:45,592
All couples have to be tied together.

172
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:47,427
But we're not a couple.

173
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,222
You sure looked like it on the beach.

174
00:23:56,811 --> 00:24:00,315
So... do you go to weddings... a lot?

175
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:06,154
Not my idea of a good time.

176
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,031
Me neither.

177
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,157
Here.

178
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,244
We supposed to drink this?

179
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:14,371
No. Put your fingertips in it

180
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:18,833
and place three dots
on each other's foreheads for good luck.

181
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,169
- Enjoy.
- I could use some good luck.

182
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,462
"Enjoy"?

183
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,225
Okay, my turn.

184
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:36,977
Come on, let's just get a drink.
Leave that.

185
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,020
All right. One second.

186
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,359
This is a great look for you.

187
00:24:58,665 --> 00:24:59,791
You missed a spot.

188
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:05,964
It's really kind of stuck.

189
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:09,050
Okay, okay.

190
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:11,511
Next time, use your shoe.

191
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,397
I love this song.

192
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,526
- This a Thai song?
- Yeah.

193
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:28,570
It's so good.

194
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,242
Wanna dance?

195
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:39,247
No, don't worry.

196
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,499
I don't-- I don't want to dance with you.

197
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,168
What, you think I'm a bad dancer?

198
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:46,046
- You look like you're a terrible dancer.
- Fine.

199
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,116
Hey.

200
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:23,666
I... I just wanted to thank you
for everything.

201
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:25,585
Everything?

202
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:38,056
And I wanted to apologize for...
getting you into this mess.

203
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:45,313
Those kids are everything to me.

204
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:50,235
If they get trafficked or...
or killed...

205
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,739
I couldn't bear it.

206
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,284
I understand.

207
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,083
I was an orphan, too.

208
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,921
I was sold to an East End gangster

209
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:12,632
who specialized
in training child soldiers.

210
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:14,134
Crain was there, too.

211
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,220
What happened?

212
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,640
I escaped, he didn't.

213
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:25,603
No doubt they blamed him.

214
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,272
Took it out in blood.

215
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:31,276
So now he blames you.

216
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:34,487
Yeah, this is his payback.

217
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,326
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

218
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:42,704
It's not your fault.

219
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:24,597
What are we gonna do?

220
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:32,605
I worked it out.

221
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:36,442
Supply boat from the back side
of the island, out of view.

222
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:38,403
By tomorrow night,
you'll be out of danger.

223
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:40,113
Your kids, too.

224
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:41,906
It's all arranged.

225
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,075
What about Crain?

226
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:46,327
I'm not doing his three kills.

227
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:52,792
Once you're safe,
there's only going to be one. Him.

228
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,877
But they'll never let you near him.

229
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:58,298
They'll never know I was there.

230
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:05,179
I want you to hold on
to something for me.

231
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:06,806
Until I come back.

232
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:12,562
My father gave this to me.

233
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,940
It's the only memory I have of him.

234
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:22,447
I'll keep it safe.

235
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,193
That's Crain's guy.

236
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,236
Look at me.

237
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,198
Remember, I'll make sure
to get you home.

238
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:06,366
Trust me.

239
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,180
Bishop!

240
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,766
Bishop!

241
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:34,352
Help!

242
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,524
Bishop!

243
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:40,983
Bishop!

244
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:52,286
Mr. Crain, I have him right here.

245
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:57,041
Tell me how to find you face-to-face.

246
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:31,993
Are we done?

247
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:34,287
Follow me.

248
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,175
Sit down.

249
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:54,974
Please, don't move.

250
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:57,643
I'd listen to her
if I were you, Arthur.

251
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,730
No need for guards or guns

252
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:03,232
when the man you want's
sitting on a pound of Semtex.

253
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:05,276
How did you find me, Riah?

254
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,820
What, no, "Hello.
Nice to see you after all these years"?

255
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:13,201
But then, you always were one
for getting down to business.

256
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:15,870
How did I find you?

257
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:17,705
You should know better
than anyone, Arthur,

258
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:19,749
there's no privacy anymore.

259
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,626
Not with wonderful things like

260
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:24,795
facial recognition
and satellite tracking.

261
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:29,175
I'm going to give you something
I never give anyone;

262
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,219
chance to walk away.

263
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:33,888
Give me the girl and walk away.

264
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:38,059
I see you've developed
a sense of humor over the years.

265
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:42,688
But if it's all the same: no.
I need you. You're the best.

266
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:46,692
Open it.

267
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,906
I need you to eliminate three people.

268
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,366
And this is the first.

269
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:56,661
His name is Krill.
Mass-murderer and warlord.

270
00:33:56,744 --> 00:34:00,623
He's also the highest-profile
arms dealer in Africa.

271
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,793
He's imprisoned
on Penjara Kaedah in Malaysia.

272
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,295
His imprisonment
is what keeps him secure.

273
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:09,298
It's impossible for his enemies
to get to him.

274
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:11,926
And this?

275
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:14,095
It's important that you
swallow it only after the kill,

276
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:17,348
or the fuel cell will degrade
and we'll never find you.

277
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:18,933
Where's Gina?

278
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:22,937
Do the three kills, Arthur.
Get the girl back.

279
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:26,315
Even if you don't love her,
you at least owe her, no?

280
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,859
I mean, she's in this shit
because of you.

281
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:31,112
How do I know you'll keep her alive?

282
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:34,323
Finish your kill, get a video call.

283
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:37,159
After the last one, you'll receive
instructions where to find her.

284
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:39,036
And your word's good, is it?

285
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,039
Good heavens, absolutely not.

286
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:45,710
But I do have a very keen
sense of self-preservation.

287
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:49,213
I know that cheating you
will only make me your target.

288
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:52,091
And since that concludes
our business for the moment,

289
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:56,721
I wish you <i>bonne chance.</i>

290
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:30,671
Let's get moving, sweetheart, come on.

291
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:33,966
Come on, let's go.

292
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:48,272
<i>The prison is 70 miles out to sea,</i>

293
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:52,151
<i>set atop cliffs
more than 100 meters high</i>

294
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:55,029
<i>and surrounded by shark-infested waters.</i>

295
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:59,575
<i>So, basically impossible to get in,
and nobody has ever gotten out.</i>

296
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,370
<i>It will be even harder to get your man.</i>

297
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:06,374
<i>He's surrounded at all times
by his team of loyal soldiers.</i>

298
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:10,169
<i>Getting him alone
will be your main challenge.</i>

299
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:52,503
Shark repellent. Yes, sir.

300
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:57,758
Thank you.

301
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,395
It's powerful stuff.

302
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:10,980
Hope you know what you're doing.

303
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:41,237
- Hey!
- Hey, hey, hey, you!

304
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,989
What? What?
What do you want, huh?

305
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:46,367
- Hey, stop.
- Yeah, right.

306
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,202
- Stop.
- Fuck you.

307
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:01,006
Martin Basman,
you are under arrest.

308
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,182
Thank you.

309
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:27,384
<i>Bishop, remember,
it has to look like an accident.</i>

310
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:32,264
<i>If he dies with a knife in his back,
no one will be there to pick you up.</i>

311
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:37,019
<i>Good luck.</i>

312
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,629
- Who the hell is that?
- Krill.

313
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:10,344
He was an executioner for people like
Charles Taylor and the Sudanese militia.

314
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:13,305
People say he ate
the hearts of his victims.

315
00:41:15,683 --> 00:41:17,976
Some have relatives who want revenge.

316
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:21,730
Like that guy over there.

317
00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:24,817
He used to be Krill's best assassin.

318
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,986
Now all he wants to do is kill him.

319
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:32,074
But he has his bodyguards
constantly protecting him.

320
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:17,054
You are a good man.

321
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,723
Why don't you join us for dinner?

322
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,311
I'm not sure I like the company.

323
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:29,441
Then they are not invited.

324
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:03,433
Hey. Come, come.

325
00:44:03,517 --> 00:44:05,310
Come in, my friend.

326
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:11,942
There are six murders
and 23 stabbings every week

327
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:15,404
in this shithole.

328
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,447
Most of them pointed at me.

329
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:22,786
That guy you stopped,
he used to work for me.

330
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:27,583
Maybe he is still upset
that I killed his brother.

331
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:36,216
Loyalty is a scarce commodity
in my line of business.

332
00:44:39,136 --> 00:44:41,972
Oh, yes.

333
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:45,267
How did you know
that he would want to kill me?

334
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:46,935
I hear things.

335
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:50,522
My juju tells me everything
that I need to hear.

336
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:53,358
Maybe you weren't listening hard enough.

337
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,032
Do you know who I am?

338
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:02,576
Krill.

339
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:04,995
You run this place.

340
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:07,456
Exactly.

341
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:12,961
And when I get out of this place,
I'm going to run all of Africa.

342
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:15,714
There could be a job
for a man like you.

343
00:45:19,343 --> 00:45:21,053
I already have a job.

344
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:23,138
- What job?
- You.

345
00:46:35,377 --> 00:46:37,170
Let the man pray.

346
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,500
Here he comes.

347
00:48:49,136 --> 00:48:50,345
He's right below us.

348
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:52,389
Bring up the net.

349
00:49:11,158 --> 00:49:12,742
Nothing in the net, sir.

350
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:15,829
What the fuck?

351
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:17,497
Looking for someone?

352
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:20,959
I want my call.

353
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:28,091
Well, Bishop survived.

354
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:37,851
<i>Hello, Arthur.</i>

355
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:39,102
Happy now?

356
00:49:39,186 --> 00:49:41,188
<i>Nice work on Krill.</i>

357
00:49:41,271 --> 00:49:43,231
Prison food'll kill you.

358
00:49:44,316 --> 00:49:45,942
Put Gina on.

359
00:49:46,026 --> 00:49:47,527
<i>Here's your boyfriend.</i>

360
00:49:47,611 --> 00:49:48,987
<i>Hi.</i>

361
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,363
How are you holding up?

362
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:52,032
<i>I'm okay.</i>

363
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:56,328
<i>Crain wanted me to let you know that
you have 36 hours</i>

364
00:49:56,411 --> 00:50:00,040
<i>to eliminate the next target,
or they will eliminate me.</i>

365
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:02,876
That won't happen.

366
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:05,587
<i>Okay, this is all very sweet, Arthur.</i>

367
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,631
<i>But you heard what she said.</i>

368
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:09,674
<i>You need to pick up the pace.</i>

369
00:50:09,758 --> 00:50:12,510
<i>This is your next kill.
Adrian Cook.</i>

370
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:35,200
Did Bishop tell you where he got this?

371
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:40,872
It belonged to his father.

372
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:45,794
I never saw him take it off. Never.

373
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:48,838
You know, I wasn't sure
there was anything

374
00:50:48,922 --> 00:50:50,757
in the world that could break Arthur,

375
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,302
until I saw you wearing this watch.

376
00:50:54,386 --> 00:50:56,721
Now I know he'll do anything for you.

377
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:20,996
<i>In the heart of downtown Sydney,
atop a 58-story high-rise,</i>

378
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:24,165
<i>is the penthouse suite
owned by Adrian Cook,</i>

379
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:26,710
<i>the mining and minerals billionaire.</i>

380
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:28,545
<i>Few people know that he originally</i>

381
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:33,717
<i>made his fortune in human trafficking,
specializing in underage sex workers.</i>

382
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,720
<i>He has plenty of manpower
protecting him, of course.</i>

383
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:38,638
<i>But that's the least of it.</i>

384
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:43,393
<i>There you go.</i>

385
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:46,396
<i>The Sydney Opera House
and the Harbour Bridge.</i>

386
00:51:52,736 --> 00:51:55,697
<i>Cook's paranoia
is only trumped by his ego.</i>

387
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,158
<i>Exhibit A. His cantilever pool.</i>

388
00:52:01,328 --> 00:52:05,582
<i>The walls and floors are all concrete,
three-feet thick.</i>

389
00:52:08,126 --> 00:52:11,254
<i>Every door is made
of six-inch nickel chromium steel.</i>

390
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:13,923
<i>That's like 12 armor plates.</i>

391
00:52:14,007 --> 00:52:16,718
<i>And the biometric sensors
and retina readers at the access points</i>

392
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:18,219
<i>are impossible to hack.</i>

393
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:21,222
<i>It's a fortress in the sky.</i>

394
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:53,755
Mr. Clark.
Good to meet you. Shall we?

395
00:52:55,256 --> 00:53:00,261
So each apartment has over 300
square meters of premium living space.

396
00:53:00,345 --> 00:53:03,598
But this one gets the Sydney sunset.

397
00:53:05,183 --> 00:53:08,103
The specifications
are all in the brochure.

398
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:11,022
Let me show you
the detailed floor plan.

399
00:53:11,106 --> 00:53:15,443
We've got Italian tiles
running completely across here.

400
00:53:17,237 --> 00:53:19,614
- Oh, excuse me.
- Sure.

401
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,575
Hello? Samantha Burns.

402
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:25,120
Hello?

403
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:31,960
Sorry about that.
So, where were we?

404
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:33,962
You were about to tell me
about the floor plans.

405
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:35,213
Oh, yes.

406
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:23,428
But we're not dumping <i>on</i> the reef.

407
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:25,680
"Near" is not on.

408
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:28,558
And if the tree-huggers
do kick up, well, then...

409
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:30,894
Yeah. That's right.

410
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:34,022
Now I've gotta go.
Now I've gotta go.

411
00:57:53,096 --> 00:57:54,931
Everyone, evacuate!

412
00:57:57,517 --> 00:57:59,352
Call the police!

413
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:09,737
<i>Billionaire Adrian Cook</i>

414
00:58:09,821 --> 00:58:12,490
<i>plunged 76 floors
to his death this morning,</i>

415
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:16,202
<i>when the glass pool
of his Sydney penthouse collapsed.</i>

416
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:17,453
<i>Although authorities...</i>

417
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:19,539
Give him his call.

418
00:58:19,831 --> 00:58:21,416
Okay.

419
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:23,292
<i>...described his death
as a tragic accident,</i>

420
00:58:23,376 --> 00:58:25,628
<i>effectively ruling out foul play.</i>

421
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:44,188
- Ready.
- Go ahead.

422
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:55,032
<i>Bishop, your watch stopped.</i>

423
00:58:56,284 --> 00:58:57,702
<i>I think it's a sign.</i>

424
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,830
Maybe it just needs cleaning.

425
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:04,125
No. Look closer.

426
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:09,422
Son of a bitch!

427
00:59:29,025 --> 00:59:30,067
<i>All right?</i>

428
00:59:30,151 --> 00:59:31,903
This the harbor master's office?

429
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:33,696
<i>Yeah, it is.
How may I assist you?</i>

430
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:36,199
My name is Tom Silva.

431
00:59:36,282 --> 00:59:40,244
Some bastard in a bloody gray yacht
just scraped my vessel.

432
00:59:40,328 --> 00:59:42,121
I have the hull number,

433
00:59:42,205 --> 00:59:44,916
but my insurance
needs the owner's details.

434
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,252
<i>Okay, mate. Go ahead.</i>

435
00:59:48,336 --> 00:59:53,382
WRX 489-674-2239.

436
00:59:53,466 --> 00:59:56,052
<i>Okay. Give me one moment.</i>

437
00:59:56,135 --> 00:59:59,764
<i>The vessel's berth is in
Sydney Harbour on Pier 7.</i>

438
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:02,433
<i>That's about it.</i>

439
01:00:02,517 --> 01:00:04,310
<i>If you need any further details...</i>

440
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:23,913
<i>The boat you're looking for
is gone, mate.</i>

441
01:00:24,872 --> 01:00:27,917
<i>It's a big one, too.</i>

442
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,504
Head out of the harbor.
It couldn't have gone far.

443
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:33,798
<i>It's your money, boss.</i>

444
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:52,275
There! East!

445
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:57,405
Come out of the sun,
so he can't see you.

446
01:00:58,072 --> 01:01:01,242
Drop it down to 60 feet
and hold it steady.

447
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:45,179
Got it. I'm heading aft deck.

448
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:52,103
Hey!

449
01:03:37,565 --> 01:03:38,983
Take him out!

450
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:42,611
Go.

451
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:56,333
Go, go!

452
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:15,686
Bishop!

453
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:46,592
You know your problem, Bishop?
You just can't help yourself.

454
01:04:46,675 --> 01:04:48,511
That's how I knew
you'd come back for her.

455
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:51,806
That's your weakness.

456
01:04:51,889 --> 01:04:54,642
Now do the third kill,
or the girl's dead.

457
01:04:56,477 --> 01:04:59,355
Take him down below.
And give him a proper sendoff.

458
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:58,664
<i>Bishop, if you pull
another stunt like that,</i>

459
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:03,085
<i>our deal is off, and you'll never
see your little girlfriend again.</i>

460
01:06:07,256 --> 01:06:10,426
<i>Now, playtime's over.</i>

461
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:17,975
<i>Go to the port town of Varna,
on the Black Sea.</i>

462
01:06:19,393 --> 01:06:21,729
<i>That's where you'll find
your third kill.</i>

463
01:06:23,772 --> 01:06:28,319
<i>His name is Max Adams,
a wealthy American arms dealer.</i>

464
01:06:35,743 --> 01:06:39,413
<i>On the north side of Varna,
you'll find a truly vulgar memorial</i>

465
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,248
<i>to Bulgarian communism...</i>

466
01:06:41,874 --> 01:06:44,001
<i>Adams spent a fortune restoring it</i>

467
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:47,171
<i>and putting in the most
comprehensive security system.</i>

468
01:06:56,472 --> 01:06:59,350
<i>But the interesting part
is what you don't see.</i>

469
01:07:00,643 --> 01:07:03,187
<i>Hidden in the mountainside
below is the sub pen.</i>

470
01:07:04,104 --> 01:07:08,192
<i>Adams stocks his U-boats with
intercontinental ballistic missiles.</i>

471
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:14,949
<i>Nobody gets in or out.
Many have died trying.</i>

472
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:20,204
<i>So, needless to say, this will be
the hardest site to penetrate by far.</i>

473
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:24,124
<i>On top of all that, Krill and Cook's
deaths may have Adams on the defense.</i>

474
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:31,674
<i>You have 24 hours.</i>

475
01:07:47,773 --> 01:07:50,693
You're using me
to take out the competition.

476
01:09:07,561 --> 01:09:09,438
We will dispatch helicopter.

477
01:10:04,076 --> 01:10:05,577
<i>Once you reach the compound,</i>

478
01:10:05,661 --> 01:10:08,247
<i>you'll have to deal with
several layers of security.</i>

479
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,695
<i>The building has
its own power system, oxygen supply,</i>

480
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:24,072
<i>and a state-of-the-art panic room.</i>

481
01:11:26,408 --> 01:11:27,910
<i>Good luck, Arthur.</i>

482
01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:57,189
Open the goddamn door.

483
01:11:57,314 --> 01:11:58,899
Please?

484
01:12:12,579 --> 01:12:13,914
Call me when you know something.

485
01:12:21,088 --> 01:12:23,799
<i>No sign of the intruder, Mr. Adams.</i>

486
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:25,509
That's because he's sitting
right in front of me

487
01:12:25,592 --> 01:12:28,011
here in the safe room, jackoff.

488
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:33,725
Magnificent.
Even if it is all stolen and looted.

489
01:12:33,809 --> 01:12:35,727
Cubo-futurist totalitarianism.

490
01:12:35,811 --> 01:12:40,107
Of course it's magnificent.
Like... dinosaur bones.

491
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:41,358
It's ugly.

492
01:12:43,193 --> 01:12:44,653
Who the fuck are you?

493
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:46,238
I'm here to talk.

494
01:12:46,363 --> 01:12:48,031
Lose your cell phone?

495
01:12:48,115 --> 01:12:50,701
I should've hired
those guys from Houston.

496
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:52,494
All right, what is it
that you want to talk about?

497
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:55,247
I want to help you avoid an accident.

498
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:58,333
Krill, Cook, that was you.

499
01:12:58,417 --> 01:13:01,670
I warned those guys that one day Crain
would come after all of us.

500
01:13:01,753 --> 01:13:03,255
Cappuccino? Espresso?

501
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:05,132
Espresso. No sugar.

502
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:11,930
Krill was a warlord, and also the
number-one arms dealer in Africa.

503
01:13:12,014 --> 01:13:15,726
Cook used his mining empire as a cover
to control the Asian franchise.

504
01:13:15,809 --> 01:13:18,770
You got Europe, most of South America.

505
01:13:18,854 --> 01:13:22,065
North America, too,
if you count Mexicans.

506
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:23,650
That didn't leave much for Crain.

507
01:13:24,484 --> 01:13:26,278
So I have a deal for you.

508
01:13:27,029 --> 01:13:30,365
Well, I'm a dealer.

509
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:31,825
We can talk about it.

510
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:41,877
I've been called
a lot of ugly names over the years,

511
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:44,963
Communist, socialist, racist, fascist...

512
01:13:45,047 --> 01:13:47,132
None of which is true, of course.

513
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:48,216
Well...

514
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:51,636
I'm certainly not a communist.

515
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,431
You just admire
their architecture.

516
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:56,058
I believe in fair play.

517
01:13:56,141 --> 01:14:00,771
I saw the David and Goliath story
play out on the frontlines of Vietnam.

518
01:14:00,854 --> 01:14:04,608
Soviets in Afghanistan.
Ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.

519
01:14:04,691 --> 01:14:06,526
Chemical weapons on the Kurds.

520
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:09,696
The little guy is always
gonna need a slingshot,

521
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:11,907
and somebody's always gonna pay for it.

522
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:15,327
An arms dealer with a moral clause.

523
01:14:16,745 --> 01:14:21,166
Let's talk about Crain.
We both need him gone.

524
01:14:21,249 --> 01:14:24,586
The question is, how do we accomplish
that? He's got an army around him.

525
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:28,215
We need something tempting enough so
that Crain uses his men to go after it.

526
01:14:29,257 --> 01:14:33,345
- What do you have in mind?
- Your submarine pen.

527
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:37,224
Have them search
for weapons, treasure...

528
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:38,475
Your corpse.

529
01:14:39,267 --> 01:14:40,477
What?

530
01:14:41,937 --> 01:14:43,522
You'll have to die.

531
01:14:43,605 --> 01:14:45,315
Well, that's easy.

532
01:14:45,399 --> 01:14:47,484
Although it will cost
a tremendous amount of money.

533
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:50,112
You can afford it.

534
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:04,376
Are the boats all secured?

535
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:06,086
Yes, sir.

536
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:08,004
- Batteries charged?
- Yes, sir.

537
01:15:08,088 --> 01:15:10,298
- Fully provisioned?
- Yes, sir.

538
01:15:10,382 --> 01:15:12,384
You get those Russian girls
in here last night for the crew?

539
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:13,510
Yes, sir.

540
01:15:13,593 --> 01:15:15,804
Well, looks like we're ready to go.

541
01:15:23,895 --> 01:15:25,272
Stay here.

542
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:58,805
<i>There was an explosion,
and Mr. Adams fell into the water.</i>

543
01:15:58,889 --> 01:16:02,726
<i>His security, they tried to reach him,
but the rocks came down,</i>

544
01:16:02,809 --> 01:16:06,021
<i>and he was buried under the water.
Gone.</i>

545
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:13,570
Oh, my God.

546
01:16:15,113 --> 01:16:20,118
I never imagined that dying would be
so goddamn invigorating!

547
01:16:20,202 --> 01:16:21,912
Stay out of sight for two days.

548
01:16:21,995 --> 01:16:24,331
After that,
you can invigorate all you want.

549
01:16:47,521 --> 01:16:49,731
You calling for the driver?

550
01:16:49,814 --> 01:16:52,067
Making dinner reservations?

551
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:53,777
Checking in with Mom?

552
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:55,862
I'm calling Crain
to make sure he takes the bait.

553
01:17:04,037 --> 01:17:06,498
You do know how to put on a show.

554
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:08,250
There's a pier
a few miles north of Varna.

555
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:10,502
Be there tomorrow with the girl.

556
01:17:10,627 --> 01:17:12,712
Not until I see Adams' body.

557
01:17:12,796 --> 01:17:16,132
You'll find him
with his most prized possessions.

558
01:17:16,216 --> 01:17:17,759
<i>In his submarine pen.</i>

559
01:17:25,058 --> 01:17:28,436
Get over there. Find Adams' body.

560
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:31,147
Secure everything inside the pen.

561
01:17:31,231 --> 01:17:33,483
And... what about Bishop?

562
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:35,735
Kill him.

563
01:18:49,184 --> 01:18:52,145
Jeremy, point the camera forward,
so I can see.

564
01:19:11,748 --> 01:19:13,249
All right. Let's go. Fan out.

565
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:31,309
Where the hell is Bishop?

566
01:19:34,688 --> 01:19:36,773
Sir, it's clear.

567
01:19:36,856 --> 01:19:38,108
Two-one clear.

568
01:19:43,947 --> 01:19:45,782
- Contact right rear.
- Take cover!

569
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:57,502
Take cover! Take cover!

570
01:20:27,866 --> 01:20:29,033
Go, go, go!

571
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:56,394
Motherfucker!

572
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:13,495
Anything?

573
01:21:13,578 --> 01:21:15,747
No sign of him, Mr. Crain.

574
01:21:15,872 --> 01:21:21,294
Stay sharp. Bishop's coming.
You can count on it.

575
01:21:27,258 --> 01:21:29,928
- What's going on?
- Your boyfriend's coming to die.

576
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:33,932
And you're the bait. Move!

577
01:22:04,337 --> 01:22:05,839
Come on, Bishop.

578
01:22:07,757 --> 01:22:09,551
I know you're not going to let her die.

579
01:22:11,636 --> 01:22:13,263
Clear.

580
01:22:18,268 --> 01:22:19,519
Nothing here.

581
01:22:27,861 --> 01:22:29,237
Yeah, we're clear.

582
01:22:51,885 --> 01:22:53,094
Bring her to the bridge.

583
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:09,485
Let's move.

584
01:26:05,453 --> 01:26:08,289
Let's go. We have three minutes
before it blows.

585
01:26:18,174 --> 01:26:20,009
Gina. You okay?

586
01:26:20,927 --> 01:26:22,011
I'll be fine.

587
01:26:24,764 --> 01:26:27,600
Let me see. Oh, shit.

588
01:26:28,101 --> 01:26:30,061
I saw Crain doing something
on the console.

589
01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:33,981
What's going on?

590
01:26:34,065 --> 01:26:35,733
Crain is trying to kill us.

591
01:26:36,192 --> 01:26:37,610
Let's go.

592
01:26:38,444 --> 01:26:40,029
Move this shit on the boat, now!

593
01:26:40,113 --> 01:26:41,531
Yes, sir.

594
01:26:43,741 --> 01:26:45,660
- What is this?
- Just get in.

595
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:49,539
Wait. What are you doing?

596
01:26:49,622 --> 01:26:50,915
Making sure you live.

597
01:26:50,998 --> 01:26:54,085
No! Come with me! Bishop!

598
01:26:55,336 --> 01:26:57,088
- There he is!
- Bishop!

599
01:27:05,012 --> 01:27:06,305
Find him. Now!

600
01:27:06,389 --> 01:27:08,141
- ...move!
- Fletcher!

601
01:27:09,058 --> 01:27:10,601
Let's get going.

602
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:26,260
You never asked why.

603
01:28:26,344 --> 01:28:28,179
I know why.

604
01:28:28,304 --> 01:28:30,139
'Cause I got out, and you didn't.

605
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:32,642
And here we are again.

606
01:28:32,725 --> 01:28:36,687
You deserted me.
It's time you paid for that.

607
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:38,147
No chance.

608
01:28:39,732 --> 01:28:41,317
You're gonna get your third kill.

609
01:28:43,402 --> 01:28:46,155
But this one won't look like
an accident.

610
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:40,376
You're a dead man, Bishop.

611
01:29:43,921 --> 01:29:46,966
You might get off the boat,
but you'll never swim far enough away

612
01:29:47,049 --> 01:29:48,217
before she blows.

613
01:29:49,218 --> 01:29:50,678
Who said I was swimming?

614
01:29:57,476 --> 01:29:58,853
Bishop!

615
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:04,400
Bishop!

616
01:30:07,278 --> 01:30:08,946
Bishop!

617
01:30:35,014 --> 01:30:36,307
Hey!

618
01:30:37,767 --> 01:30:39,185
Hey!

619
01:31:03,876 --> 01:31:05,920
Were there any survivors?

620
01:31:07,630 --> 01:31:08,923
No.

621
01:31:24,355 --> 01:31:26,357
So Bishop never made it.

622
01:31:26,482 --> 01:31:28,109
Even legends die.

623
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:53,717
<i>Dear Mei. I'm back
in Cambodia with the kids.</i>

624
01:31:53,801 --> 01:31:55,803
<i>The water filter's working.</i>

625
01:31:55,886 --> 01:31:58,556
<i>Thank you so much
for your generous gift.</i>

626
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:00,474
<i>You have to come here someday.</i>

627
01:32:00,558 --> 01:32:03,561
<i>I think you'd like it a lot.</i>

628
01:32:03,644 --> 01:32:08,482
<i>Bishop would have loved it.
See you soon. I hope.</i>

629
01:32:08,566 --> 01:32:11,527
<i>Lots of love, Gina.</i>

630
01:33:40,991 --> 01:33:42,243
Clever son of a bitch.

631
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:03,597
Sneaky bastard.

632
01:34:03,681 --> 01:34:07,643
Bang. You're dead.

632
01:34:08,305 --> 01:35:08,943
