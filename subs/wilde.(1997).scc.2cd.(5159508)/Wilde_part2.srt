1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,259
- Mr. Wilde, sir.
- Yes?

2
00:00:06,821 --> 00:00:08,577
- For you.
- Thank you.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.org ] ==-

4
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:23,159
"For Oscar Wilde...

5
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:24,542
Ponce," is it?

6
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:26,845
"Ponce and 'somdomite."'

7
00:00:26,946 --> 00:00:30,906
"Posing as a sodomite."
He's illiterate... illiterate, ignorant.

8
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:33,877
- It's hideous.
- We've got him now, Robbie.

9
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:35,707
He wrote it down.
The porter read it.

10
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:38,457
That makes it a public libel.
Now we can take him to court.

11
00:00:38,624 --> 00:00:40,566
For God's sake.

12
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:46,611
Oscar, you mustn't do that.
That would be... I mean...

13
00:00:46,718 --> 00:00:48,954
We've just been waiting for a chance
to get him in the dock...

14
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:51,735
and show the world what a swine
and shit he's always been.

15
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:55,578
- To me, my mother, my brothers.
- But he'll plead justification.

16
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:58,293
He'll call all the renters
as witnesses for the defense.

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,078
Of course he won't.
He doesn't know what a renter is.

18
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:05,498
I hear he's had detectives following you
ever since you came back from Egypt.

19
00:01:05,627 --> 00:01:08,081
He can't prove anything.
But we can.

20
00:01:09,434 --> 00:01:11,539
We can prove he's the vilest man
that ever walked the earth.

21
00:01:11,642 --> 00:01:13,397
Tear the card up, Oscar.
Pretend you never got it.

22
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:16,430
Are you mad?
That's our main piece of evidence.

23
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:18,925
I'm sure if Oscar went abroad
for a few months...

24
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:21,006
lived on royalties
while your father calms down...

25
00:01:21,112 --> 00:01:23,600
- Whose side are you on?
- Bosie, if this goes to court...

26
00:01:23,736 --> 00:01:25,645
Oscar will have to tell lies...

27
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:28,402
perjure himself...
everything will come out.

28
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:31,184
Whatever the result,
it will be utter disaster.

29
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,877
You're an enemy then.

30
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:36,843
No, no, Bosie, please.
Robbie...

31
00:01:36,949 --> 00:01:40,331
you're a dear boy, but I can't
even think of leaving the country.

32
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:45,323
As a matter of fact, I can't even
leave this hotel. I can't pay the bill.

33
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:47,980
We can raise you money,
for heaven's sake.

34
00:01:48,147 --> 00:01:50,634
Anyway, what about
your royalties?

35
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,592
We shall need all the money
we can get for the libel case.

36
00:01:53,842 --> 00:01:57,103
My father can't go on making
all our lives a torment like this.

37
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:00,143
Oscar, I beg you.

38
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:02,792
I'm not going to run away, Robbie.

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,124
I'm not going to hide.
That would be the English thing to do.

40
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:09,551
If you take Queensberry to court,
all hell will break loose.

41
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,061
All my life I've fought
against the English vice:

42
00:02:13,198 --> 00:02:15,947
Hypocrisy...
not that that's the point.

43
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,300
The point is, Queensberry's already
caused the death of one of his sons.

44
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:24,170
If I don't try and stop him now,
whom will he harm next?

45
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:27,976
<i>He's avoiding me, Robbie.</i>

46
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,773
I know what everyone's saying,
but it's not true.

47
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:34,695
It's not true.

48
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:39,298
- Is it?
- Of course not.

49
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,598
Oh, it's so shaming.

50
00:02:44,393 --> 00:02:48,484
No, I find it easier to stand.

51
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:52,707
I'm going to Torquay for a month,
try to get my back right.

52
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:56,102
- Oscar's been so busy...
- I'm sure he'll be terribly upset...

53
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:59,492
when he knows you've been
in so much pain.

54
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,547
The truth is,
I need some money.

55
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,321
Not even sure where he is
to ask for it.

56
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:11,102
It does seem rather hard when he's
having such an extraordinary success.

57
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:12,730
I think I can find him.

58
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:18,754
I keep hearing these stories
about Bosie and his father.

59
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:23,006
- I'm sure you don't want to...
- Oh, yes. I do.

60
00:03:24,802 --> 00:03:29,111
Men think women should be
protected by not knowing.

61
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:31,518
Not knowing only makes it worse.

62
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,082
Is there going to be trouble?

63
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:40,889
I hope not.

64
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:45,212
<i>I believe a prosecution
would certainly succeed...</i>

65
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:47,130
provided...
and I stress this...

66
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:51,003
provided there is no truth whatever in
the accusation made by Lord Queensberry.

67
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:52,921
Of course
there's no truth in it.

68
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,827
Then so long as I have Mr. Wilde's
assurance that that is indeed the case.

69
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:11,699
There is no truth
in the accusation whatever.

70
00:04:12,857 --> 00:04:16,370
Good. Excellent.

71
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:20,943
The defense, I understand,
will be led by Mr. Edward Carson.

72
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:25,516
Old Ned? I was at college
with him in Dublin.

73
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:29,845
No doubt he will perform his task with
all the bitterness of an old friend.

74
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:34,413
In writing a book or a play,
I'm concerned entirely with literature...

75
00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:38,509
with art... I do not aim
at doing good or evil...

76
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:40,784
but at making a thing that will have
some quality of beauty.

77
00:04:40,884 --> 00:04:46,001
Well, listen, sir. Here is
one of your pieces of literature.

78
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:48,782
"Wickedness is a myth
invented by good people...

79
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:51,150
to account for the curious
attractiveness of others."

80
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,191
Do you think that true?

81
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:59,598
Oh, I rarely think
anything I write is true.

82
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:05,096
"If one tells the truth, one is sure,
sooner or later, to be found out."

83
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:11,334
That is a pleasing paradox, but
I do not set store by it as an axiom.

84
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:13,773
Is it good for the young?

85
00:05:13,902 --> 00:05:17,000
Anything is good that stimulates
thought, at whatever age.

86
00:05:17,102 --> 00:05:18,857
Whether moral or immoral?

87
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:21,771
There's no such thing
as morality or immorality in thought.

88
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:23,459
What about this then?

89
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:27,146
"Pleasure is the only thing
one should live for."

90
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:32,544
I think that the realization of
one's self is the prime aim of life...

91
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:36,807
and that to realize through pleasure is
finer than to do so through pain.

92
00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:40,615
I am, on this point, entirely on
the side of the ancients, the Greeks.

93
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:46,562
<i>How long have you known
Alfred Taylor?</i>

94
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:49,381
<i>About two years,
two-and-a-half years.</i>

95
00:05:49,544 --> 00:05:53,089
- Is he an intimate friend of yours?
- I wouldn't call him that, no.

96
00:05:53,255 --> 00:05:55,676
But you went often to his rooms?

97
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:58,019
About seven or eight times,
perhaps.

98
00:05:58,118 --> 00:06:02,176
Did you know Mr. Taylor kept
ladies' dresses in his rooms?

99
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:09,633
Did you know he was notorious
for introducing young men to older men?

100
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:12,895
I never heard it in my life.

101
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:14,818
Has he introduced
young men to you?

102
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,695
Yes.

103
00:06:17,859 --> 00:06:21,241
- How many young men?
- About five.

104
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:25,786
- What were their occupations?
- I really don't know.

105
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:28,409
Oh, well, let me tell you,
Mr. Wilde.

106
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:32,221
You met a man called
Charles Parker there, I believe.

107
00:06:32,385 --> 00:06:33,399
Yes.

108
00:06:33,505 --> 00:06:36,155
Charles Parker is...

109
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,076
a gentleman's valet.

110
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,339
You met his brother there
too, I believe.

111
00:06:41,503 --> 00:06:43,673
- Yes.
- He is a groom.

112
00:06:45,694 --> 00:06:47,897
I didn't care tuppence
what they were.

113
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:52,405
I liked them. I have a passion
to civilize the community.

114
00:06:52,573 --> 00:06:56,696
I recognize no social distinctions
at all of any kind.

115
00:06:56,828 --> 00:06:58,737
To me, youth...
the mere fact of youth...

116
00:06:58,844 --> 00:07:02,836
is so wonderful that I would sooner
talk to a young man for half an hour...

117
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,128
than, well, than be
cross-examined in court.

118
00:07:07,258 --> 00:07:10,127
So, do I understand that...

119
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:13,529
even a boy you might pick up in the
street would be a pleasing companion?

120
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:17,683
I would talk to a street Arab
with pleasure if he would talk to me.

121
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:19,540
- And take him to your rooms?
- Yes.

122
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:22,159
And then commit
improprieties with him?

123
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,137
Certainly not.

124
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,077
<i>You withdraw your libel action
against Lord Queensberry.</i>

125
00:07:32,246 --> 00:07:34,068
Well and good.

126
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,393
But there remains the question
of the evidence...

127
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:40,840
Lord Queensberry's evidence
against you.

128
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,038
My information is that the Crown
wishes to pursue the matter.

129
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:51,304
In which case, an arrest
and a charge of gross indecency...

130
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,319
are certain to follow.

131
00:07:53,426 --> 00:07:57,103
The maximum sentence
is two years hard labor.

132
00:07:57,266 --> 00:08:00,975
Nine months hard labor
is reckoned to be more...

133
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:02,892
than a man of our background...

134
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:04,714
can survive.

135
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,163
The children, the boys...

136
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:12,196
- I must go and see them.
- You have no time for that.

137
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:16,426
But my wife...
I have to say good-bye to my wife.

138
00:08:16,558 --> 00:08:19,046
Unless you positively wish
to subject her...

139
00:08:19,213 --> 00:08:21,417
to the further humiliation
of seeing you arrested...

140
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:24,616
and taken away
in front of the gutter press...

141
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:26,472
<i>Mr. Wilde, you must go.</i>

142
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:37,028
Oscar, you must take that train.

143
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,879
Practically everyone
you know will be on it.

144
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:44,384
At least 600 single gentlemen,
all in abject terror of arrest.

145
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:52,481
Where your life leads you,
you must go.

146
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:55,581
<i>I defy society.</i>

147
00:08:55,687 --> 00:08:57,148
Tell him to go.

148
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:01,283
He must save himself.

149
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:04,954
Tell him to go abroad.

150
00:09:05,062 --> 00:09:07,134
I've been telling him all day.

151
00:09:08,677 --> 00:09:10,237
He won't budge.

152
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:21,181
People have never understood
the courage he needed to be himself.

153
00:09:21,282 --> 00:09:23,321
You must go abroad too.

154
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:26,393
We must all go abroad at once.

155
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,874
Oscar says, will you
tell the boys good-bye.

156
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,928
I need to go through his papers.

157
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,583
You know,
I was always too silent.

158
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,506
If I'd known...

159
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:51,794
If I'd only spoken up.

160
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:53,908
It wouldn't have made
any difference.

161
00:09:55,581 --> 00:09:57,075
Perhaps not...

162
00:09:58,204 --> 00:10:01,171
but at least I wouldn't
blame myself now.

163
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:26,994
<i>You're an Irish gentleman.
Of course, you must stay.</i>

164
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:29,298
Your father fought
when he was libeled.

165
00:10:29,398 --> 00:10:32,115
<i>- I was in the courts myself. I fought...
- Yes, I know, Madre.</i>

166
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:35,855
You will fight these
English philistines, and you'll win.

167
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:40,527
And even if you lose...
if you go to prison...

168
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:43,562
you'll always be my son.

169
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:45,872
Of course, it's too late
to change that now.

170
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:48,907
If you go, Oscar...

171
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:51,311
I'll never speak to you again.

172
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,508
No one will ever speak
to me again, whatever I do.

173
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:59,307
<i>Of course I'm your son, Madre...</i>

174
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,507
which is why,
even if I lose...

175
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:04,812
the English
will never forget me.

176
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,221
My darling.

177
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:39,527
Get out of my way.
Get out! Out!

178
00:11:40,842 --> 00:11:42,597
Take me away at once!

179
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:52,639
Lady Wilde. Lady Wilde!

180
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:55,492
Have you anything to say about
your son's disgrace, Lady Wilde?

181
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:57,411
<i>Have you anything to say?</i>

182
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:06,082
Come in.

183
00:12:12,644 --> 00:12:14,432
Mr. Wilde, I believe.

184
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:16,985
Yes, yes.

185
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:19,196
We have a warrant here
for your arrest...

186
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:22,081
on a charge
of committing indecent acts.

187
00:12:29,793 --> 00:12:31,865
<i>I recommend Switzerland
as soon as possible.</i>

188
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:34,685
You will have to change
your name, of course.

189
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:38,233
I can't.

190
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:40,790
My dear Constance,
the name of Wilde will be...

191
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,901
a word of execration
for the next thousand years.

192
00:12:43,006 --> 00:12:46,453
You can't possibly let your boys grow up
with people knowing who they are.

193
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,345
Think of their lives at school.

194
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:50,778
Thank you for your advice.

195
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,165
I'm sorry our friendship
has to end like this.

196
00:12:54,268 --> 00:12:58,261
- Oh, you will always be my friend.
- I am still Oscar's wife.

197
00:12:58,364 --> 00:13:02,454
That must cease forthwith.
Forthwith. Do you understand?

198
00:13:02,555 --> 00:13:05,238
Anybody who has anything
to do with Oscar from now on...

199
00:13:05,403 --> 00:13:08,152
will never be received
in society again...

200
00:13:08,314 --> 00:13:09,491
ever.

201
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:18,417
Oh, God, Ada.
What is going to happen to him?

202
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,557
That's Oscar Wilde's boy.

203
00:13:28,663 --> 00:13:31,051
Oscar, you must let me
in the witness box.

204
00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:33,426
If the jury can only hear
what I have to say...

205
00:13:33,558 --> 00:13:35,630
Bosie, darling boy.

206
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:38,515
As soon as they see you
in all your golden youth...

207
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:40,716
and me in all my corruption...

208
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,016
You didn't corrupt me.
I corrupted you, if anything.

209
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:45,903
That's not how it will seem.

210
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:49,133
But I must have my say.
It's outrageous.

211
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:52,201
Everyone else has said everything,
anything that came into his head.

212
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:54,793
But I'm the person
all this is about.

213
00:13:54,962 --> 00:13:57,263
It's me my father wants
to get at, not you.

214
00:13:57,393 --> 00:13:59,662
It's outrageous
that I can't have my say.

215
00:13:59,793 --> 00:14:04,014
It won't help, Bosie.
It may actually make things worse.

216
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:08,486
But my father will win.
I can't endure my father winning.

217
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:12,328
You must go away, dear boy.

218
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,918
I couldn't bear for them
to arrest you.

219
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:21,061
I can't bear what they're
saying about you in court.

220
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:25,930
Jesus Christ.

221
00:14:27,948 --> 00:14:29,987
Good-bye, Bosie, dear boy.

222
00:14:30,092 --> 00:14:33,125
Don't let anyone, anything,
ever change your feeling for me...

223
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:34,753
change your love.

224
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:37,608
- See you next time.
- Time's up, my lord.

225
00:14:37,771 --> 00:14:41,926
Oscar, never. They never will.
I won't let them.

226
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:54,751
<i>You've been a great deal
in the company of Lord Alfred Douglas?</i>

227
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,228
Oh, yes.

228
00:14:57,671 --> 00:15:00,572
- Did he read his poems to you?
- Yes.

229
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:03,841
So, you can perhaps
understand that...

230
00:15:03,974 --> 00:15:06,177
some of his verses...

231
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:11,524
would not be acceptable to a reader
with an ordinary balance to mind?

232
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,143
I'm not prepared to say.

233
00:15:14,307 --> 00:15:17,274
It's a question of taste
and temperament...

234
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:19,418
and individuality.

235
00:15:19,523 --> 00:15:22,424
I should say that one man's poetry
is another man's poison.

236
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,831
Yes, I daresay.

237
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:27,383
But in this poem
by Lord Alfred Douglas...

238
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:29,758
"Two Loves"...

239
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:31,645
there is one love,
true love...

240
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:35,288
which... and I quote...

241
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:38,936
"fills the hearts of boy and girl
with mutual flame."

242
00:15:39,103 --> 00:15:43,096
And, there is another:

243
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,387
"I am the love
that dare not speak its name."

244
00:15:49,502 --> 00:15:51,443
Was that poem explained to you?

245
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:55,705
- I think it's clear.
- There's no doubt as to what it means?

246
00:15:55,836 --> 00:15:57,363
Most certainly not.

247
00:15:57,532 --> 00:16:00,281
So, is it not clear
that the love described...

248
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:03,923
relates to natural
and unnatural love?

249
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,177
Then what is the love
that dare not speak its name?

250
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:27,792
The love that dare not
speak its name...

251
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,379
in this century...

252
00:16:30,518 --> 00:16:32,940
is such a great affection...

253
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:36,372
of an elder for a younger man...

254
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,867
as there was between
David and Jonathan...

255
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:43,568
such as Plato made
the very basis of his philosophy...

256
00:16:43,732 --> 00:16:47,244
and such as you may find in
the sonnets of Michelangelo...

257
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:48,785
and Shakespeare.

258
00:16:51,027 --> 00:16:55,336
It is, in this century,
misunderstood...

259
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:58,822
so much misunderstood
that it may be described as...

260
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:01,579
the love that dare not
speak its name.

261
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:05,192
And, on account of it,
I am placed where I am now.

262
00:17:06,863 --> 00:17:09,798
It is beautiful.
It is fine.

263
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,453
It is the noblest form
of affection.

264
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:16,963
There's nothing unnatural
about it.

265
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:21,226
It is intellectual...

266
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:24,968
and it repeatedly exists
between an elder and a younger man...

267
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:28,710
when the elder has intellect...

268
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,209
and the younger man...

269
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,746
has all the joy, hope
and glamour of life before him.

270
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:42,215
That it should be so,
the world does not understand.

271
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:44,319
The world mocks at it...

272
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:48,385
and sometimes puts one
in the pillory for it.

273
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:09,371
The crime of which
you have been convicted...

274
00:18:09,477 --> 00:18:11,484
is so bad...

275
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:14,751
that I shall pass
the severest sentence...

276
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:17,982
that the law will allow.

277
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:22,686
In my judgment, it is totally
inadequate for such a case as this.

278
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:26,808
It is the worst case
I have ever tried!

279
00:18:26,914 --> 00:18:29,531
The sentence of the court...

280
00:18:29,696 --> 00:18:31,801
is that you will be imprisoned...

281
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:35,035
<i>and held to hard labor...</i>

282
00:18:35,136 --> 00:18:37,721
<i>- Stand aside, please.
- for two years.</i>

283
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:39,643
- Shame.
- Pervert.

284
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,135
Pervert!

285
00:18:52,988 --> 00:18:54,744
Shame on you!

286
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:15,854
Disgusting!

287
00:19:40,532 --> 00:19:43,695
<i>A slim thing,
gold-haired like an angel...</i>

288
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:46,097
<i>stands always at my side.</i>

289
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:49,839
<i>He moves in the gloom
like a white flower.</i>

290
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:54,192
<i>I thought but to defend him from
his father. I thought of nothing else.</i>

291
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:12,487
<i>Now my life seems
to have gone from me.</i>

292
00:20:12,654 --> 00:20:14,858
<i>I'm caught in a terrible net.</i>

293
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,608
<i>But so long as I think
he is thinking of me...</i>

294
00:20:17,774 --> 00:20:22,050
<i>my sweet rose, my delicate flower,
my lily of lilies...</i>

295
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:26,083
<i>it is in prison that I shall
test the power of love.</i>

296
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:29,254
<i>I shall see if I can't make
the bitter waters sweet...</i>

297
00:20:29,356 --> 00:20:31,657
<i>by the intensity of the love
I bear you.</i>

298
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,804
<i>He asked me not to change.
Those were his last words to me...</i>

299
00:20:48,936 --> 00:20:50,845
"Don't change."

300
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:54,399
Well, things are going to have
to change when he comes out.

301
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:57,632
He'll have no money at all.

302
00:20:57,734 --> 00:21:00,254
- So you're blaming me, too, are you?
- I'm not blaming anyone.

303
00:21:00,422 --> 00:21:03,869
Bosie, you're not the only person
on this earth Oscar cares about.

304
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,898
You've always hated me,
Robbie...

305
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:11,266
because Oscar loved and still loves me
when you were just one of his boys.

306
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:23,455
I'm suffering just as much
as he is, you know.

307
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:26,907
My life's ruined too.

308
00:21:27,073 --> 00:21:31,327
I'm much younger than he is. I've hardly
had any life, and it's ruined already.

309
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:35,002
When Oscar gets out,
we'll live together properly.

310
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,713
We'll take a villa
somewhere near here... Posilipo...

311
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,399
- or Ischia.
- Or Capri.

312
00:21:43,423 --> 00:21:45,724
I'll take care of him.

313
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:48,123
I'll give him
everything he wants.

314
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:51,348
I love him, Robbie.

315
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:56,113
Oscar's mine,
and I'm going to have him.

316
00:22:12,185 --> 00:22:16,821
<i>"Years went over, and the giant
grew very old and very feeble.</i>

317
00:22:16,984 --> 00:22:20,726
<i>He couldn't play about anymore,
so he sat in a huge armchair...</i>

318
00:22:20,888 --> 00:22:24,335
<i>and watched the children at their games
and admired his garden.</i>

319
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:31,179
<i>'I have many beautiful flowers, '
he said.</i>

320
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:34,962
<i>'But the children are
the most beautiful flowers of all. "'</i>

321
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:14,214
I'm afraid Cyril has got
some idea why you're here.

322
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,058
I'm sending him
to school in Germany.

323
00:23:20,813 --> 00:23:23,082
I can't manage them on my own.

324
00:23:26,732 --> 00:23:29,350
Your back isn't better then?

325
00:23:29,516 --> 00:23:31,272
No, not really.

326
00:23:33,035 --> 00:23:35,304
I may have to have an operation.

327
00:23:37,195 --> 00:23:40,577
What I've done
to you and the boys...

328
00:23:40,714 --> 00:23:42,502
I can't...

329
00:23:42,665 --> 00:23:45,381
I shall never forgive myself.

330
00:23:47,816 --> 00:23:50,336
If we could choose
our natures...

331
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:54,783
If we could only choose.

332
00:23:54,887 --> 00:23:56,642
But it's no use.

333
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:03,266
Whatever our natures are,
we must fulfill them...

334
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:06,588
or our lives... my life...

335
00:24:06,693 --> 00:24:10,009
would have been filled
with dishonesty.

336
00:24:12,324 --> 00:24:15,040
Even more dishonesty
than there actually was.

337
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:22,495
I've always loved you,
Constance.

338
00:24:24,514 --> 00:24:25,975
You must believe me.

339
00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:30,517
I don't see
how you can have done...

340
00:24:30,656 --> 00:24:32,412
not truly.

341
00:24:33,568 --> 00:24:35,292
Not if all the time...

342
00:24:35,456 --> 00:24:36,917
I didn't know.

343
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:42,107
"Know thyself,"
I used to say.

344
00:24:43,998 --> 00:24:46,419
I didn't know myself.

345
00:24:47,998 --> 00:24:49,753
I didn't know.

346
00:24:53,021 --> 00:24:55,257
I suppose you want a divorce.

347
00:24:57,627 --> 00:24:59,089
You have every reason.

348
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:05,848
I've been thinking,
when you do come out...

349
00:25:05,978 --> 00:25:08,661
when they let you out...
you can go to Switzerland or Italy...

350
00:25:08,826 --> 00:25:11,543
write another play,
get yourself back.

351
00:25:12,729 --> 00:25:15,150
You can.

352
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:17,939
You're so clever.
You can.

353
00:25:28,182 --> 00:25:30,156
I don't want a divorce.

354
00:25:34,486 --> 00:25:37,103
Will you ever let me
see the children again?

355
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,918
Of course.

356
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,719
But there must be one condition:

357
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,797
Oscar, you must never
see Bosie again.

358
00:25:56,529 --> 00:26:00,554
If I saw Bosie now,
I'd kill him.

359
00:26:04,592 --> 00:26:06,697
The children love you, Oscar.

360
00:26:15,182 --> 00:26:17,669
They'll always love you.

361
00:26:26,188 --> 00:26:28,522
Did anyone tell you?

362
00:26:28,651 --> 00:26:31,106
<i>They've been performing
Salome in Paris.</i>

363
00:26:39,754 --> 00:26:43,398
<i>"The giant hastened across the grass
and came near to the child.</i>

364
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:46,113
<i>And when he came quite close,
his face grew red with anger.</i>

365
00:26:46,281 --> 00:26:50,503
<i>And he said,
'Who hath dared to wound thee? '</i>

366
00:26:50,631 --> 00:26:53,697
<i>For on the palms of the child's hands
were the prints of two nails.</i>

367
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:56,516
<i>And the prints of two nails
were on his little feet.</i>

368
00:27:12,036 --> 00:27:16,127
<i>'Who hath dared to wound thee? '
Cried the giant.</i>

369
00:27:16,227 --> 00:27:19,772
<i>'Tell me, that I may take
my big sword and slay him. '</i>

370
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,077
<i>'Nay, 'answered the child.</i>

371
00:27:22,178 --> 00:27:24,447
<i>'For these are
the wounds of love. "'</i>

372
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,029
Bosie thinks I'm jealous.

373
00:27:35,168 --> 00:27:37,142
I think it will come as a shock
to Bosie to realize...

374
00:27:37,248 --> 00:27:40,029
that even he is relatively unimportant
in the scheme of things.

375
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:44,019
But, no doubt, Bosie will be
remembered as long as Oscar...

376
00:27:44,126 --> 00:27:45,718
unfortunately.

377
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:52,793
I sometimes wonder...

378
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:57,560
if I hadn't...

379
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:02,709
pushed him into...

380
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,052
Don't.

381
00:28:05,722 --> 00:28:08,056
Oscar was very lucky
to meet you, Robbie.

382
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,678
Think who else
it might have been.

383
00:28:11,802 --> 00:28:13,906
Oh, I'll have that one.
Thank you.

384
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:17,718
- Must you go abroad again at once?
- I shouldn't be here now.

385
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,342
But has he got anywhere to go
when he's released?

386
00:28:23,447 --> 00:28:25,170
It'll have to be in France.

387
00:28:25,335 --> 00:28:27,920
I'm going to see
what I can arrange.

388
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:30,191
But here...

389
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:32,236
when he leaves prison...

390
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,013
- Good-bye, Mr. Harris.
- Good-bye, sir.

391
00:28:40,116 --> 00:28:42,385
Good-bye, Mr. Snow.
Thank you.

392
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:50,284
My dear Sphinx.

393
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:54,990
How marvelous of you to know what hat
to wear at 7:00 in the morning...

394
00:28:55,153 --> 00:28:57,935
to meet a friend
who's been away.

395
00:28:58,097 --> 00:29:00,846
- No, I'll keep this.
- What is it.

396
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:03,496
It's a letter to Bosie
telling him...

397
00:29:03,632 --> 00:29:05,737
how I love him
but can never see him again.

398
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,589
I'm going to ask Robbie
to have it copied out before I send it.

399
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:11,947
I rather fear Bosie
might throw it on the fire.

400
00:29:12,078 --> 00:29:15,209
<i>I call it De Profundis.
It comes from the very depths.</i>

401
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,302
<i>"I know not whether laws
be right...</i>

402
00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:53,732
<i>or whether laws be wrong.</i>

403
00:29:53,863 --> 00:29:55,902
<i>All that we know
who lie in jail...</i>

404
00:29:56,007 --> 00:29:58,079
<i>is that the wall is strong...</i>

405
00:29:58,183 --> 00:30:01,182
<i>and that each day
is like a year...</i>

406
00:30:01,285 --> 00:30:03,554
<i>a year whose days are long.</i>

407
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,547
<i>Yet each man kills
the thing he loves.</i>

408
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,920
<i>By each, let this be heard.</i>

409
00:30:14,052 --> 00:30:15,874
<i>Some do it with a bitter look...</i>

410
00:30:16,035 --> 00:30:18,969
<i>some with a flattering word.</i>

411
00:30:19,074 --> 00:30:21,408
<i>The coward does it
with a kiss...</i>

412
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:23,806
<i>the brave man with a sword.</i>

413
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,700
<i>Some kill their love
when they are young...</i>

414
00:30:28,801 --> 00:30:31,451
<i>and some when they are old.</i>

415
00:30:31,616 --> 00:30:34,780
<i>Some strangle
with the hands of lust...</i>

416
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:37,497
<i>some with the hands of gold.</i>

417
00:30:37,663 --> 00:30:40,380
<i>The kindest use a knife...</i>

418
00:30:40,543 --> 00:30:43,641
<i>because the dead
so soon grow cold. "</i>

419
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:54,233
I'm sure we can find
an hotel near here.

420
00:30:57,084 --> 00:30:59,505
Somewhere where you can work.

421
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:10,449
- I've decided to see him again, Robbie.
- Yes.

422
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:14,483
- I thought you might.
- I've nothing left.

423
00:31:15,577 --> 00:31:17,878
I've lost my wife.

424
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:19,983
I've lost my children.

425
00:31:21,848 --> 00:31:23,603
They won't allow me
to see them now.

426
00:31:25,303 --> 00:31:26,993
No one will ever read
my plays or books again.

427
00:31:27,158 --> 00:31:28,652
Yes, they will.

428
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,692
Bosie loves me more
than he loves anyone else...

429
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:36,077
as much as he can love...

430
00:31:36,181 --> 00:31:38,930
and allow himself to be loved.

431
00:31:42,515 --> 00:31:44,817
I think we need
some more wine.

432
00:31:47,763 --> 00:31:50,763
I find that alcohol...

433
00:31:50,866 --> 00:31:53,255
taken in
sufficient quantities...

434
00:31:56,945 --> 00:32:00,294
Can bring about
all the effects of drunkenness.

435
00:32:41,705 --> 00:32:43,232
<i>"Life cheats us with shadows.</i>

436
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:46,717
<i>We ask it for pleasure.
It gives it to us...</i>

437
00:32:46,856 --> 00:32:50,020
<i>with bitterness
and disappointment in its train.</i>

438
00:32:50,152 --> 00:32:53,151
<i>And we find ourselves looking
with dull heart of stone...</i>

439
00:32:53,255 --> 00:32:55,295
<i>at the tress
of gold-flecked hair...</i>

440
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:57,886
<i>that we had once
so wildly worshipped...</i>

441
00:32:58,022 --> 00:33:00,029
<i>and so madly kissed. "</i>

442
00:33:35,104 --> 00:33:38,551
<i>In this world, there are
only two tragedies.</i>

443
00:33:38,687 --> 00:33:40,826
<i>One is not getting
what one wants.</i>

444
00:33:40,927 --> 00:33:43,480
<i>The other is getting it.</i>

445
00:33:44,305 --> 00:34:44,761
