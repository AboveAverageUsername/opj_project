3
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,699
<i>Just look at him.</i>

4
00:00:22,872 --> 00:00:26,069
<i>So sleek, so powerful...</i>

5
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,803
<i>...so beautiful.</i>

6
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:33,019
<i>? Like some great
golden god made flesh.</i>

7
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:36,789
<i>Of course, any sensible god
would demand absolute obedience...</i>

8
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,925
<i>...in return for his favor.</i>

9
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:44,253
<i>But, no, our Man of Steel
protects us and keeps us...</i>

10
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,165
<i>...with no
strings attached.</i>

11
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:48,854
<i>And the people, hmm...</i>

12
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:51,704
<i>...they practically
worship him anyway.</i>

13
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:56,305
<i>Enjoy your reign
while you may, Superman.</i>

14
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,845
<i>For as surely as
night follows day...</i>

15
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:05,242
<i>...there comes a time
when even gods must die.</i>

16
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,283
I don't care how many weeks
you spent on that story, Lane.

17
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:21,120
<i>The Daily Planet is not about
to attack a charity organization.</i>

18
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,790
You know Lex Luthor couldn't care less
about the homeless, chief.

19
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,859
It's a front to siphon money
back to LexCorp...

20
00:03:27,023 --> 00:03:29,361
...so he can fund the
manufacture of high-tech arms...

21
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:31,230
...to sell on
the black market.

22
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:32,725
Allegedly.

23
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:36,001
Look, how many exposes do I have to write
before Metropolis wakes up...

24
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:38,738
...and sees through
Luthor's philanthropy shtick?

25
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:40,573
As many as it takes.

26
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:42,842
But it helps to
have a smoking gun.

27
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:45,144
You sure you're not
on LexCorp's payroll, chief?

28
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,114
You've been mighty soft
on the prince of darkness lately.

29
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:52,651
Excuse me for not wanting
to be sued for libel, again.

30
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,687
Well, LexCorp's going down...

31
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,389
...whether it's me
or Superman who does it.

32
00:03:57,553 --> 00:04:01,927
If it's Superman, that makes it news,
and I'll be happy to print it.

33
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:05,297
Kent, shouldn't you be
on your way to the airport?

34
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:09,268
I always make my flight, chief.
Just packing the last of my things.

35
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:11,070
Well, don't forget to write.

36
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:12,854
Sure thing, Perry.

37
00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:18,010
Articles, Kent, articles.
That's what foreign correspondents do.

38
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,346
Perry's really broken up
about you leaving.

39
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,190
Ah, he'll miss me
when I'm gone, Jimmy.

40
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,965
Well, I'm off to
Afghanistan, Lois.

41
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:42,309
Happy trails, Smallville.

42
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,965
Guess I'll be seeing you.

43
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,822
Don't step on
any landmines.

44
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:33,719
Two miles below
Earth's surface.

45
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:35,654
Even Superman
can't see us here.

46
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:39,278
Luthor's sure to
be happy about that.

47
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:46,999
Heat's fricking unbearable.
- Yeah, forget Luthor and his happiness.

48
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:49,501
"I shall invent a
new energy source...

49
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:53,138
...by harnessing radiation
emitted from the Earth's core. "

50
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:56,342
And rake in billions
while we drown in our own sweat.

51
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:59,245
Don't be surprised if he asks us
to dig straight to hell.

52
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:00,613
We're halfway
there already.

53
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,649
"Insert a diode catheter
into Satan's rectum...

54
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:07,052
...run a feed back to LexCorp,
and crank up the juice. "

55
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:13,378
"Keep Metropolis' power grids
burning bright until the end of time. "

56
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,117
Whoa! Dr. Murphy.

57
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:21,300
What is it?
- I'm no scientist.

58
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,625
You tell me.

59
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:36,807
Lex.

60
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:45,357
Get this to Biochem, hand-carry only.
Keep it off the interlink.

61
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:48,294
I know the drill, Lex.
What is it, the cure for cancer?

62
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,795
Muscular dystrophy.

63
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,632
I can cure every known case
with a simple inoculation.

64
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:56,568
Have Swan find a way
to slow it to a crawl...

65
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:59,171
...turn it into a
lifetime treatment program.

66
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,874
Right now, it's a mere
$300-billion windfall.

67
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:04,743
And you need it
to be a perennial, got it.

68
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:07,246
But Swan's working the AIDS thing.

69
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,982
Oh, right. What
about Schaffenberger?

70
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:12,114
Bird flu.
- Mm.

71
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:15,220
Guess Jerry's kids
will have to wait their turn.

72
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:17,723
Now, Mercy, what
have you got for me?

73
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:22,147
Project Applecore.
They've hit the mother lode.

74
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,652
Have you cured
cancer yet, Kal-El?

75
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:49,188
I can design a machine that
receives faint transmissions...

76
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:51,957
...from the distant future,
sculpt a miniature sun...

77
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:53,692
...from dwarf-star matter...

78
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:57,196
...but I can't find a way to keep
human cells from metastasizing.

79
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,600
I wish I could help humankind by doing
more than just being its resident strongman.

80
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:04,803
One thing I've learned since arriving
in Metropolis is that those in power...

81
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:07,039
...don't always have
the people's interests at heart.

82
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:09,641
As much as I love dishing
on evil bald-headed freaks...

83
00:08:09,805 --> 00:08:11,777
...I thought we came here
to get away from it all.

84
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:14,146
You wouldn't have a blow-dryer?

85
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,615
We'll need to get you
a larger travel bag, Lois.

86
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:20,953
I wouldn't need so many warm baths
if our weekend getaway was Palm Springs.

87
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:25,157
The Antarctic camouflages Kryptonian
crystal-tech far better than cacti.

88
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:29,161
But next time you catch a chill,
give a holler, I'll warm you.

89
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:32,664
You wouldn't use your heat visiÛn
on me, would you, Superman?

90
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:36,127
No, just the x-ray.
- You're bad.

91
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:49,910
Um, maybe we could find
a robot-free zone?

92
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:03,257
That's it, Mr. Luthor.

93
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:06,832
<i>- Definitely a spacecraft.
- Of alien origin.</i>

94
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:08,156
Vintage?

95
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:10,436
<i>- Were deep.
- Before Christ deep.</i>

96
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,104
<i>Thats a conservative estimate.</i>

97
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:15,941
Last time aliens fell
to Earth, we got Superman.

98
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:19,611
This time, whatever's in
that tin can will belong to me...

99
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:22,608
...lock, stock and barrel.

100
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,419
What happened?

101
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,021
<i>We have a puncture.</i>

102
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:56,085
<i>How are we supposed
to understand him?</i>

103
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:57,558
It's a warning.

104
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,052
Aah!
Clear out! Clear out!

105
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:27,881
Use the rays of the laser.

106
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:09,688
If an alien race possessed
the technology to trap that thing...

107
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:14,793
...and use Earth as their personal
toilet, they did so for one reason.

108
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:16,957
They couldn't kill it.

109
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:55,601
You know, I've
been thinking...

110
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:57,995
Hmm?
- About Clark.

111
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:01,206
Kent? While you're snuggling
with me?

112
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,270
I think I'm jealous.

113
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:07,279
Smallville's going on assignment
in a dangerous part of the worid.

114
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:10,382
They say I'm brave,
but I'm bulletproof.

115
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:12,851
Ordinary men and women
who put their lives on the line...

116
00:12:13,015 --> 00:12:14,620
...they're the real heroes.

117
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:17,823
I just find it interesting that
the more intimate you and I become...

118
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:22,447
...the more distant
Clark becomes, literally.

119
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:27,799
Superman, I wanna know everything
there is to know about you...

120
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:29,668
...like your real name.

121
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,323
Hmm. It's Kal-El.

122
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:35,498
Your other real name.

123
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:54,819
Biscuit.

124
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,489
Biscuit.

125
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:03,086
Mother...

126
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:25,924
That monster's trail of destruction will lead
the authorities right to my doorstep.

127
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:30,996
Relax, Lex. Applecore may have been illegal,
but it was completely under the radar.

128
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,733
See that it stays that way.
Scorch Earth if you have to.

129
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,957
LexCorp was never there.

130
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:41,973
Look, I know who you are.
Why can't you just tell me?

131
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:45,377
Lois, I care about you
more than anyone else on Earth.

132
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,213
To reveal my secret identity
would compromise your safety.

133
00:13:48,377 --> 00:13:51,450
Please. My safety was compromised
the moment I met you.

134
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:54,186
How many times
have you had to rescue me?

135
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,339
Rhetorical.

136
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:58,557
I haven't told you my identity for the same
reason we haven't gone public...

137
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:01,593
...with our relationship,
why we come here to be alone.

138
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,762
Well, try reading a gossip column.

139
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,998
Practically all of Metropolis
thinks we're dating anyway.

140
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:09,701
You're clinging to keep one last part
of you separate from us...

141
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:12,671
...and the only reason I can fathom
is that for an alien...

142
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:17,409
...you've developed a very human,
very male fear of commitment.

143
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:19,010
We've been together for six months.

144
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:23,148
It'd be nice if I could start calling you
something other than Superman.

145
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:26,611
He also goes by Kal-El.
- Shut up.

146
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:32,317
Well, that was
some first fight.

147
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:35,348
Be nice if it
was our last.

148
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:48,700
Maybe you're right. Maybe it is time
you got to know the real me.

149
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,593
Kal-El.

150
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,139
This isn't a good time.
You are needed in Metropolis.

151
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:57,075
It is a matter of
terrific urgency.

152
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:59,578
I have isolated a match
via interstellar records...

153
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:01,146
...from your father's archives.

154
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,982
The subject in question
was biologically engineered...

155
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:05,484
...to be the ultimate soldier.

156
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:08,583
Precise, clinical, unstoppable.

157
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,222
But its creators
came to realize...

158
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:14,092
...that it could not distinguish
between friend and foe.

159
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:19,064
Thus, this doomsday machine
lives to extinguish any and all life forms...

160
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,526
...because it must.

161
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:25,857
We need to clear this area.

162
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:40,037
Fire!

163
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:58,503
You're dropping me off here?

164
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:01,473
Doomsday's at Hob's End
on the East Side.

165
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:03,628
Exactly.

166
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:11,608
Jimmy, meet me on the roof,
and don't forget your camera.

167
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:12,604
Uh, Lois, shouldn't
we wait for a pilot?

168
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:14,572
I'm an Air Force brat, remember?

169
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,575
I was flying these things when
you were still in training pants.

170
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,832
Now, hang on.

171
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:54,540
There.

172
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:29,462
Jimmy, camera
on the action.

173
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:37,931
Oh, man, he can jump!

174
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:34,170
Thanks, Superman.

175
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:43,209
Get out of here. Now.

176
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,945
Superman, don't...

177
00:21:45,654 --> 00:21:47,519
It's why I'm here.

178
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:56,187
I've never seen Superman
take such a pounding.

179
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,791
Not that he can't dish it.

180
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:19,877
<i>For those just joining
us, Metropolis is the scene...</i>

181
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,779
<i>...of widespread
destruction this morning...</i>

182
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:24,816
<i>...as Superman attempts to
overpower a creature responsible...</i>

183
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,718
<i>...for a string of grisly murders.</i>

184
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:33,102
<i>But as of right now, its uncertain
which way the tide will turn.</i>

185
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:07,158
Lois, do you think Superman's o...?

186
00:25:07,322 --> 00:25:09,942
Camera on the
action, Jimmy.

187
00:26:48,823 --> 00:26:50,654
Superman.

188
00:27:01,936 --> 00:27:03,403
Is everyone?

189
00:27:03,938 --> 00:27:08,568
You did it, Superman.
We're safe, all of us.

190
00:27:09,844 --> 00:27:12,608
Good. That's...

191
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:16,581
That's all that matters.

192
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:19,847
Clark.

193
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,070
Superman died
as he lived...

194
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,274
...defending Metropolis.

195
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,921
He may have come
from another worid...

196
00:28:24,085 --> 00:28:27,613
...but he will
always belong to ours.

197
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,773
James Olsen?

198
00:28:52,947 --> 00:28:55,253
Your photos of
the tragedy were...

199
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:57,408
Well, words fail.

200
00:28:57,585 --> 00:29:01,692
It must have been hard for you,
being Superman's pal, I mean.

201
00:29:01,856 --> 00:29:04,216
If you ever need to talk.

202
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:30,588
What is he doing here?

203
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,557
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's somehow responsible.

204
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:35,860
Luthor doesn't
matter right now.

205
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,015
Come on, Lois.

206
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,165
Today, Superman's
funeral was viewed...

207
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:43,668
...by hundreds of
millions woridwide.

208
00:29:43,832 --> 00:29:48,039
Not since President Kennedy died
has our nation so collectively mourned.

209
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:51,976
Yet it is the people of Metropolis
who are feeling the loss most...

210
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,078
...as we knew him best.

211
00:29:54,242 --> 00:29:58,082
So let us take a brief moment
to celebrate his time with us.

212
00:29:58,246 --> 00:30:01,452
<i>? Last year for Halloween,
I dressed like Superman.</i>

213
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:05,423
<i>Now Im gonna do it every year
for the rest of my life.</i>

214
00:30:05,587 --> 00:30:09,860
<i>I was installing a satellite dish
when I slipped off the roof, three stories.</i>

215
00:30:10,024 --> 00:30:11,929
<i>I should have been a goner.
But out of nowhere...</i>

216
00:30:12,093 --> 00:30:16,973
<i>...everyones guardian ·ngel
was suddenly mine too.</i>

217
00:30:20,301 --> 00:30:21,739
Not a word from Kent.

218
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,742
He hasn't called, hasn't e-mailed.

219
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,636
Clark isn't coming back.

220
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:31,082
It's Afghanistan, chief.
People die there every day.

221
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:34,719
Look, Lane, Kent's fine.
Just lost in the trenches.

222
00:30:34,883 --> 00:30:37,388
You know how he disappears
into his work.

223
00:30:37,552 --> 00:30:41,292
What are you doing here anyway?
I told you to take time off.

224
00:30:41,456 --> 00:30:44,795
And do what? I'm trying
to keep myself occupied.

225
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:47,932
Well, occupy yourself
with friends or family.

226
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,696
You must have someone
you can talk to.

227
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:09,315
Yes?
- Mrs. Kent?

228
00:31:09,484 --> 00:31:11,145
I'm Lois Lane.

229
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:14,325
<i>- From the Daily Pl...
- I know who you are, Miss Lane.</i>

230
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:17,128
My son talks about you quite often.

231
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,764
He's the reason
I've come to see you.

232
00:31:19,928 --> 00:31:22,099
Has there been word
from Afghanistan?

233
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:24,568
I've been... Well, I
have been so worried.

234
00:31:24,732 --> 00:31:26,461
Mrs. Kent...

235
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:30,834
...you know as well as I do
that your son...

236
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,932
...died in Metropolis last week.

237
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:38,249
Look, I'm not here as a reporter. L...
- Then why are you here, Miss Lane?

238
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:41,439
I don't know exactly.

239
00:31:41,616 --> 00:31:44,107
Maybe it's just...

240
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:46,891
I don't know if he told you,
but we had been seeing each other...

241
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:50,661
...for the past few months,
romantically, I mean.

242
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,330
And I know the rest
of the worid adored him...

243
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,032
...and misses him
now that he's gone...

244
00:31:55,196 --> 00:31:58,035
...but no one else
on this whole stupid planet...

245
00:31:58,199 --> 00:32:04,275
...can know what it felt like
to really love him, to be loved by him...

246
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:05,576
...or how it feels now...

247
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,980
...every minute of
every day, like I'm broken.

248
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:15,548
Like I'm the one that
freaking monster pounded on.

249
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:28,332
You know, I was just about
to put on a fresh pot of coffee.

250
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:30,501
You look like
you could use a cup.

251
00:32:30,665 --> 00:32:33,793
God, yes. Thank you.

252
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,515
<i>As feared...</i>

253
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:46,617
<i>...crime rates have soared
in the past weeks.</i>

254
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:48,419
<i>Criminals have
become more daring...</i>

255
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:51,722
<i>...and Metropolis P.D. Remains
understaffed and underfunded.</i>

256
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:52,890
On the bright side...

257
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,726
...technologies mogul
and philanthropist Lex Luthor...

258
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,597
...contributed $ 10 million
to the police department earlier today.

259
00:32:59,761 --> 00:33:03,234
But ultimately, Metropolis
is faced with a stark reality...

260
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,736
...that no police force,
no matter how well-equipped...

261
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,820
...will ever be as
omnipresent as one man.

262
00:33:17,712 --> 00:33:19,583
You've made the
right decisiÛn, James.

263
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:23,554
<i>We at the National Voyeur feel
there's enough misery in the worid today.</i>

264
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:25,422
Why rub people's noses in it?

265
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,691
We're in the business
of entertainment, Mr. Swank.

266
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:30,015
And making money, James.

267
00:33:30,692 --> 00:33:33,422
Please, call me Jimmy.

268
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,932
Jimmy gave notice?

269
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:40,104
What notice? Little ingrate up and left.
Working for that tabloid rag.

270
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,108
But why would he...?

271
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,878
Look, chief, this has been hard
on all of us, Jimmy included.

272
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:51,782
I'm sure this is just his way
of trying to, you know, heal.

273
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:55,429
Don't sugarcoat it, Lane.
Olsen's weak.

274
00:33:55,593 --> 00:34:00,176
He isn't man enough
to keep a grip on his ideals.

275
00:34:01,723 --> 00:34:07,064
Easy enough to lose sight of, I suppose,
in a worid without Superman.

276
00:34:07,228 --> 00:34:11,936
Which reminds me, you rode shotgun
with Metro P.D. On that sleeper cell raid.

277
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,437
Kind of risky,
don't you think?

278
00:34:13,601 --> 00:34:16,173
No more than usual, chief.
Why should things be any different?

279
00:34:16,337 --> 00:34:21,312
Because he isn't here to pull your ass
out of the fire anymore, that's why.

280
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,808
Be careful, Lane.

281
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,322
Taken before his time.

282
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,080
So completely...

283
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:37,315
...absurdly random.

284
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,831
Come on, Lex. I figured
you'd be stoked he's finally gone.

285
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,299
Isn't this what you wanted?

286
00:34:42,463 --> 00:34:45,125
I wanted a winning strategy.

287
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:49,406
Instead, I've been cheated of
the victory I've planned for years...

288
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:52,543
...by an intergalactic soccer hooligan.

289
00:34:52,707 --> 00:34:55,112
Your scientists
found the hooligan.

290
00:34:55,276 --> 00:34:57,056
Speaking of which...

291
00:34:57,478 --> 00:34:59,984
...you did see to it that
little mess was cleaned up?

292
00:35:00,148 --> 00:35:03,140
LexCorp was never there.

293
00:35:08,156 --> 00:35:10,681
And neither were you.

294
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:34,852
Toyman doesn't
feel like sharing.

295
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:38,096
The goodies are
mine, mine, mine.

296
00:35:40,521 --> 00:35:44,628
All you action figures and
your accessories better back off...

297
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:50,112
...or the kiddies are coming down
the hard way, ker-splat!

298
00:35:51,966 --> 00:35:53,488
Are you suicidal?

299
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,873
We're supposed to
report news, not make it.

300
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:59,957
Forget the news.
Those kids are gonna die.

301
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:08,613
That's it, ta-ta.
We'll play again another day.

302
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:19,886
It's okay.

303
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:38,209
Come on.

304
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:49,814
It's safe now.

305
00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:52,821
It's okay.

306
00:36:54,195 --> 00:36:55,423
Wha...?

307
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,761
My play dates.

308
00:37:09,277 --> 00:37:11,768
Fun time's over!

309
00:37:28,262 --> 00:37:31,356
School's out forever!

310
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:54,918
Your stop. Be right back.

311
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,426
Superman's back?

312
00:38:01,162 --> 00:38:02,789
You? But you're...

313
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:04,964
Taking you in, Toyman.

314
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,929
Giddyup!

315
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:36,333
Pfft. Like we really needed him
to bust up a mechanical spider, right?

316
00:38:36,497 --> 00:38:38,192
Lame.

317
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:45,269
Um, thank you, Superman.

318
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:47,202
It's why I'm here.

319
00:38:59,286 --> 00:39:01,024
It's really me, Lois.

320
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:02,212
I'm back.

321
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:05,325
I can see that, feel that.

322
00:39:05,493 --> 00:39:06,517
But how?

323
00:39:06,694 --> 00:39:09,720
I awoke in darkness.

324
00:39:09,897 --> 00:39:12,002
The last thing I remember
before that is...

325
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:15,089
You're here, unless I'm dreaming.

326
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:16,540
That's all that matters.

327
00:39:16,704 --> 00:39:18,384
Oh, you missed it.

328
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:31,116
Here you go.

329
00:39:35,923 --> 00:39:38,949
You are glad to see me?

330
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,924
Of course, Lois. It's just...

331
00:39:42,096 --> 00:39:43,667
I may need time
to re-acclimate.

332
00:39:43,831 --> 00:39:46,203
I did just come back
from the grave, you know.

333
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:47,891
Of course.

334
00:39:48,769 --> 00:39:51,033
So see you soon?

335
00:39:51,205 --> 00:39:52,968
Yeah. Soon.

336
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:07,724
We will soon commence
renovation of Superman Memorial Park...

337
00:40:07,888 --> 00:40:10,327
...to celebrate
the occasiÛn of his return.

338
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,862
There's work to be done.

339
00:40:12,026 --> 00:40:15,632
<i>But I will make the streets
of Metropolis safe again.</i>

340
00:40:15,796 --> 00:40:17,957
It's a miracle.

341
00:40:18,132 --> 00:40:19,622
A miracle.

342
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,209
Can you believe
Superman's back?

343
00:40:26,373 --> 00:40:32,533
He'll whip this city back to shape.
I thought Superman wasn't dead.

344
00:40:42,056 --> 00:40:43,546
Luthor.

345
00:40:45,893 --> 00:40:48,384
<i>Over here, Superman.</i>

346
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,366
<i>Warm.</i>

347
00:41:01,342 --> 00:41:03,401
<i>Warmer.</i>

348
00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:08,585
<i>If youre wondering why you cant
see through these walls, Superman...</i>

349
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:11,529
<i>...theyre
lined with lead.</i>

350
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:29,679
My rumpus room also comes equipped
with red solar lamps...

351
00:41:29,842 --> 00:41:33,534
...and, of course, kryptonite.

352
00:41:34,175 --> 00:41:37,795
Red and green,
the colors of Christmas.

353
00:41:38,112 --> 00:41:43,106
And you are on
the naughty list!

354
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,510
Why did you leave me?

355
00:41:45,673 --> 00:41:47,143
Why?

356
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:55,224
We had so much
unfinished business.

357
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,907
Who's your daddy?

358
00:42:11,078 --> 00:42:17,087
By the way, you're doing a fine job
of convincing the worid you're Superman.

359
00:42:17,251 --> 00:42:19,446
Keep up the good work.

360
00:42:30,431 --> 00:42:32,135
I've done it, Superman.

361
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,515
Achieved the unimaginable.

362
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:38,575
Sculpted your clone with a strand
of DNA from a fleck of blood...

363
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:41,812
...swabbed from the scene
of your epic final battle.

364
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:47,951
Your doppelganger possesses all of
your speed, strength, morality even.

365
00:42:48,115 --> 00:42:50,015
But not your mind.

366
00:42:50,184 --> 00:42:52,789
Only knows what I've
programmed him to know...

367
00:42:52,953 --> 00:42:56,093
...since you took your secrets
to the proverbial grave.

368
00:42:56,257 --> 00:42:58,566
But why should I complain?

369
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:02,732
My super-powered sycophant
bows to my every whim.

370
00:43:02,896 --> 00:43:07,704
Even tunneled all the way to Memorial Park
to pluck you from your resting place.

371
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:13,693
A bit ghoulish, I know, but
necessary to stage your coming out.

372
00:43:13,856 --> 00:43:17,481
I resented being cheated out of
orchestrating your destruction...

373
00:43:17,645 --> 00:43:18,682
...but I'm over it.

374
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:22,786
In fact, this whole miserable
experience has only made me stronger.

375
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:25,689
Put me back in
touch with my roots.

376
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:31,261
So now that you no longer stand
in the way of my plans, Superman...

377
00:43:31,425 --> 00:43:34,885
...you shall help
me to achieve them.

378
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,649
Lane. Martha, hi.

379
00:43:56,817 --> 00:44:00,123
Clark still hasn't visited.
Hasn't even phoned.

380
00:44:00,287 --> 00:44:03,927
He... He's a little
preoccupied here in Bigville.

381
00:44:04,091 --> 00:44:05,729
You know, making
up for lost time.

382
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,298
Well, you see
him, don't you?

383
00:44:08,462 --> 00:44:10,742
Not as much as I'd like.

384
00:44:24,978 --> 00:44:28,685
So this is what a potential
Pulitzer Prize winner does for a second act?

385
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:31,079
Lois, hey.

386
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,890
Don't think they'll let you past
the ropes wearing that.

387
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:35,114
Ow, ow, ow!

388
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:40,402
I'm not here to go
clubbing, Jimmy. I'm here to talk.

389
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:47,003
Lois, I'm working here.

390
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:48,900
Jimmy, look at you.

391
00:44:49,063 --> 00:44:50,833
Italian silk.

392
00:44:51,004 --> 00:44:52,809
<i>You're underpaid
at the Planet, you know.</i>

393
00:44:52,973 --> 00:44:57,647
I meant I'm not sure I like
what you think you've become.

394
00:44:57,811 --> 00:45:01,151
Ha-ha, speaking of changes,
how about the big S, huh?

395
00:45:01,315 --> 00:45:05,722
Ever consider the big S
may not be what he seems?

396
00:45:05,886 --> 00:45:07,958
He wears red and blue, flies...

397
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,828
...crime rate's plummeted
since he's risen from the grave.

398
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:13,496
Gosh, you think he's a zombie?

399
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,498
I'm not sure what he is.

400
00:45:15,662 --> 00:45:18,335
Call it reporter's nose
or woman's intuition, but...

401
00:45:18,499 --> 00:45:20,170
Whoa, you're not serious?

402
00:45:20,334 --> 00:45:24,354
Why wouldn't you think
he's really Superman?

403
00:45:26,507 --> 00:45:29,112
Okay, weird. But it
doesn't mean he's...

404
00:45:29,276 --> 00:45:32,649
I need to know the truth.
- And you could use my help.

405
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:36,193
Come on, Jimmy,
for old time's sake?

406
00:45:39,453 --> 00:45:42,792
I've moved on, Lois. I
like my life the way it is now.

407
00:45:42,956 --> 00:45:45,254
I like it just fine.

408
00:45:50,397 --> 00:45:52,369
And how was your day, Superman?

409
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:53,913
Save any lives?

410
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:04,166
A 19-second blackout at 3:47 a. m.

411
00:46:06,747 --> 00:46:08,612
Had to be an EMP.

412
00:46:09,783 --> 00:46:13,490
But you didn't get up
and walk away, Superman.

413
00:46:13,654 --> 00:46:15,794
Where the hell are you?

414
00:46:41,014 --> 00:46:43,486
<i>Winslow P.
Schott, a. k.a. Toyman...</i>

415
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,488
<i>...escaped from prison
early this morning...</i>

416
00:46:45,652 --> 00:46:49,392
<i>...and proceeded to hold several
children hostage at a daycare center.</i>

417
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:50,994
<i>After a prolonged standoff...</i>

418
00:46:51,158 --> 00:46:54,264
<i>...the fugitive was apprehended
by police just moments ago.</i>

419
00:46:54,428 --> 00:46:57,267
<i>But though Toyman is
now safely in police custody...</i>

420
00:46:57,431 --> 00:46:59,569
<i>...there is a
tragic element to the scene.</i>

421
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:04,674
<i>Minutes before his capture,
Toyman took the life of young Katy Alpert.</i>

422
00:47:04,838 --> 00:47:07,438
<i>She was only 4 years old.</i>

423
00:47:15,616 --> 00:47:18,551
I'm alive?

424
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:20,357
It would seem
that on this worid...

425
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:23,526
...the laws of human death
do not apply to you, Kal-El.

426
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:27,464
I only came to realize it 17 days
after your apparent demise...

427
00:47:27,628 --> 00:47:30,967
...when I was alerted to a single pulse
of your biorhythmic signature.

428
00:47:31,131 --> 00:47:36,159
So my vitals slowed to a crawl...

429
00:47:36,336 --> 00:47:38,274
To better enable you to heal.

430
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:42,379
I had to await a second pulse,
17 days later, in order to find you...

431
00:47:42,543 --> 00:47:45,315
...once I discovered
your body had been relocated.

432
00:47:45,479 --> 00:47:46,639
Relocated?

433
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,413
To LexCorp.

434
00:47:48,582 --> 00:47:51,321
It would appear that
Lex Luthor has cloned you.

435
00:47:51,485 --> 00:47:54,257
I need to get
back to Metropolis.

436
00:47:54,421 --> 00:47:56,292
Once you have
regained your strength.

437
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,395
I am uncertain
of your double's agenda...

438
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:03,419
...but for now, he seems to be
protecting Metropolis.

439
00:48:17,678 --> 00:48:20,583
Pardon me, officers. I need
a moment with your prisoner.

440
00:48:20,747 --> 00:48:22,840
What? Why, you can't...

441
00:48:23,183 --> 00:48:25,777
Uh, is that allowed?

442
00:48:27,854 --> 00:48:29,106
I have rights.

443
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:32,042
I have nothing
to say to you.

444
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,687
How about goodbye?

445
00:48:44,237 --> 00:48:46,535
Did he just drop him?

446
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,686
Lane. He did what?

447
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,931
Excuse me, coming through.
Move it!

448
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,128
<i>Over here.
Over here, Superman.</i>

449
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:40,930
<i>Superman, what made you do it?</i>

450
00:49:41,094 --> 00:49:44,334
<i>Toyman would have killed again.
An example needed to be set.</i>

451
00:49:44,498 --> 00:49:46,569
<i>But youve never done anything
like this in the past.</i>

452
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,238
<i>I see things
differently now.</i>

453
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,508
<i>- But what about the law?
Wont there be repercussions?</i>

454
00:49:51,672 --> 00:49:56,579
<i>I consider myself the authority
on whats best for Metropolis, dont you?</i>

455
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:59,483
That is not the boy I raised.

456
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:03,388
Precious, come down here.

457
00:50:05,185 --> 00:50:06,846
Precious.

458
00:50:08,722 --> 00:50:10,349
Got her, ma'am.

459
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:15,698
Now, you know, Persian Longhairs
really shouldn't be outdoors.

460
00:50:15,862 --> 00:50:18,368
Please, Precious didn't mean it.

461
00:50:18,532 --> 00:50:20,537
Oh, my beef isn't with the kitty.

462
00:50:20,701 --> 00:50:25,542
It really irks me when folks
don't take responsibility for the little things.

463
00:50:25,706 --> 00:50:28,645
Don't get me wrong,
I'm here to help.

464
00:50:28,809 --> 00:50:31,681
But every time I have to stop
and sweat the small stuff...

465
00:50:31,845 --> 00:50:36,920
...it potentially keeps me
from attending to more urgent matters.

466
00:50:37,084 --> 00:50:39,204
Life-threatening matters.

467
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:46,195
You may wanna think about that
next time you leave the screen door open.

468
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:49,579
I will. L... I
promise, thank you.

469
00:50:54,601 --> 00:50:57,607
The commissioner would
like a word with you, Superman.

470
00:50:57,771 --> 00:51:01,477
As I was just explaining to the lady,
I'm a little busy right now.

471
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:05,481
We've been instructed
to escort you, if necessary.

472
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,203
Really?

473
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,521
Son of a...!
- Watch the language.

474
00:51:30,637 --> 00:51:32,957
Solar boosters at maximum.

475
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:38,314
Your metabolism has
spiked exponentially, Kal-El.

476
00:51:38,478 --> 00:51:44,598
We must continue your accelerated
absorption of yellow solar energy.

477
00:51:45,118 --> 00:51:48,849
Well, the prodigal son of Krypton.

478
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:52,695
You've been acting a tad
out of character, wouldn't you say?

479
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,131
Protecting Metropolis
is out of character?

480
00:51:55,295 --> 00:52:00,115
It is when you make the streets
run red with blood.

481
00:52:00,634 --> 00:52:03,873
I put you on Earth
to attend to my dirty work.

482
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,163
Here.

483
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:07,543
A hot list of
LexCorp's competitors.

484
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:11,981
All with motive to steal Superman's corpse
for scientific gain.

485
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:14,384
Retrieve the body immediately...

486
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,482
...and discreetly.

487
00:52:17,517 --> 00:52:20,623
Remember, I brought
you into this worid.

488
00:52:20,787 --> 00:52:23,381
I can take you out of it.

489
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,829
That's what I said, right?

490
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,095
Ladies.

491
00:53:24,417 --> 00:53:26,715
Mm, lead.

492
00:53:26,887 --> 00:53:31,127
Only one thing it
could be hiding, kryptonite.

493
00:53:56,616 --> 00:54:00,316
A safe Superman
means a safe Metropolis.

494
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:05,687
Evening, Lex.

495
00:54:05,859 --> 00:54:06,985
Lois Lane.

496
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,198
How did you...?
- Get past security?

497
00:54:09,362 --> 00:54:11,159
It's what I do.

498
00:54:12,032 --> 00:54:16,139
Forgive the indelicacy, Lois,
but you look terrible.

499
00:54:16,303 --> 00:54:18,242
There's breaking news.

500
00:54:18,406 --> 00:54:22,178
Looks like you won, Lex.
You finally won.

501
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,280
I'm not sure I know
what you're talking about.

502
00:54:24,444 --> 00:54:25,715
How'd you do it?

503
00:54:25,879 --> 00:54:28,518
How did you make
Superman your puppet?

504
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:31,354
Really, Lois, these
insinuations of yours are...

505
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:34,590
Relax. I don't plan on
writing any more exposes.

506
00:54:34,754 --> 00:54:38,127
<i>I'm tired, quitting the
Planet, leaving Metropolis.</i>

507
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:41,998
But before I go, I
need to know how you did it.

508
00:54:42,162 --> 00:54:45,654
What you did to him...

509
00:54:45,832 --> 00:54:49,032
...so I can move
on with my life.

510
00:54:49,903 --> 00:54:52,531
You were more
than friends.

511
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:01,230
He was more than
your constant rescuer.

512
00:55:03,683 --> 00:55:07,543
You must be terribly
lonesome without him.

513
00:55:08,321 --> 00:55:09,310
Yes.

514
00:55:10,957 --> 00:55:14,717
Then you need someone
to take his place.

515
00:55:16,196 --> 00:55:19,029
Someone big and strong.

516
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:45,027
We have 30 minutes,
we need to work fast.

517
00:55:45,191 --> 00:55:47,431
Don't forget your camera.

518
00:56:34,174 --> 00:56:36,913
You know, I'm supposed to be covering
a celebrity rave right now.

519
00:56:37,077 --> 00:56:38,917
Save it. We're here.

520
00:56:44,184 --> 00:56:46,180
Great. Retinal scanner.

521
00:56:46,343 --> 00:56:48,150
Now what?

522
00:57:22,422 --> 00:57:24,890
Ugh. Yummy.

523
00:57:27,127 --> 00:57:30,893
A freaking circus sideshow.
Jimmy.

524
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:38,997
Superman?

525
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:40,571
Supermen.

526
00:57:41,441 --> 00:57:44,740
He's harvesting Supermen.

527
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:47,842
So you were right.

528
00:57:48,014 --> 00:57:49,618
The Superman who returned...

529
00:57:49,782 --> 00:57:51,875
A clone. A fake.

530
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:54,457
Which means the real
Superman really is...

531
00:57:54,621 --> 00:57:56,179
Yes, Jimmy.

532
00:57:57,357 --> 00:58:01,857
Dead. Just as you and
Ms. Lane are about to be.

533
00:58:04,097 --> 00:58:08,937
Because after all, there
is no Superman to save you.

534
00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:12,808
They are genetically bred
to do my bidding.

535
00:58:12,972 --> 00:58:18,580
Imagine, an army of Supermen
policing the skies of Metropolis.

536
00:58:18,743 --> 00:58:23,205
The worid
upholding the law of Luthor.

537
00:58:29,789 --> 00:58:33,384
Clearly, some
fine-tuning is required.

538
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:38,540
On the bright side, I get
to kill Superman after all.

539
00:58:49,042 --> 00:58:50,100
Oh, hell.

540
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,718
Evil Supermen?
Not on my watch.

541
00:59:47,734 --> 00:59:50,225
Evacuate the premises.

542
01:00:07,487 --> 01:00:11,719
Superman, you've
been a very, very bad boy.

543
01:00:11,891 --> 01:00:14,730
I might have to mess up
that pretty face of yours.

544
01:00:14,894 --> 01:00:18,728
That's it, come to papa.

545
01:00:46,659 --> 01:00:48,684
What's he doing?

546
01:00:51,364 --> 01:00:56,524
You're a menace to society,
Luthor. You won't be missed.

547
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:14,951
Come on.

548
01:01:23,796 --> 01:01:26,128
An alert from Metropolis.

549
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:28,237
<i>The saga of
Supermans return...</i>

550
01:01:28,401 --> 01:01:30,072
<i>...just took
another bizarre twist...</i>

551
01:01:30,236 --> 01:01:35,110
<i>...as the Man of Steel allegedly adds
tech mogul? Lex? Luthor to his recent hit list.</i>

552
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:38,514
<i>The president has declared
a state of emergency in Metropolis...</i>

553
01:01:38,678 --> 01:01:41,183
<i>...and is
considering military action.</i>

554
01:01:41,347 --> 01:01:44,053
<i>Army reserves are mobilizing,
but there is no telling...</i>

555
01:01:44,217 --> 01:01:48,023
<i>...how Superman will
respond to a show of force.</i>

556
01:01:48,187 --> 01:01:52,194
But, Kal-El, you are
only at 67 percent strength.

557
01:01:52,358 --> 01:01:54,121
It'll have to do.

558
01:02:15,348 --> 01:02:17,786
Kal-El, your double outmatches you.

559
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:20,656
You will need a
leading edge to defeat him.

560
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,082
Solar suit.

561
01:02:22,255 --> 01:02:24,860
To help absorb yellow sun rays
during my flight there.

562
01:02:25,024 --> 01:02:28,030
I had something even
more practical in mind.

563
01:02:28,194 --> 01:02:29,431
Luthor's kryptonite cannon?

564
01:02:29,595 --> 01:02:31,158
From the archives.

565
01:02:31,321 --> 01:02:34,536
The kryptonite is safely ensconced
in a lead-lined cartridge.

566
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:37,473
Properly utilized, it
will weaken your opponent...

567
01:02:37,637 --> 01:02:40,337
...and even the playing field.

568
01:03:16,976 --> 01:03:20,539
This is insane.
We can't kill Superman.

569
01:03:20,703 --> 01:03:23,252
You're right.
We can't kill Superman.

570
01:03:23,416 --> 01:03:24,956
Dead men walking.

571
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:28,991
Superman, I have to
ask you to step down.

572
01:03:29,155 --> 01:03:32,394
I don't think that would be
in the city's best interests.

573
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,698
You leave us no choice.

574
01:03:42,668 --> 01:03:45,968
I'm only doing
this because I care.

575
01:03:56,015 --> 01:03:58,575
Fall back, fall back!

576
01:04:47,033 --> 01:04:48,398
Lois?

577
01:05:05,384 --> 01:05:06,844
Look who's back.

578
01:05:12,892 --> 01:05:14,432
Who's the rocker?

579
01:05:14,927 --> 01:05:17,099
You don't think?
- I don't know.

580
01:05:17,263 --> 01:05:19,001
He's wearing Superman's shield.

581
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,969
He's also wearing black.

582
01:05:21,133 --> 01:05:24,773
Great. Bad Superman
and badder Superman.

583
01:05:24,937 --> 01:05:27,176
Metropolis is doing
just fine without you.

584
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,344
I'm not sure I
approve of your methods.

585
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:32,080
I'm not asking
for your approval.

586
01:05:32,244 --> 01:05:34,349
Get this straight,
you're not needed here.

587
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:39,153
Metropolis is under my
protection, now and forever.

588
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,778
Over my dead body.

589
01:05:46,425 --> 01:05:47,996
Was that a kryptonite gun?

590
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,180
Not very Superman-like.

591
01:06:23,162 --> 01:06:25,033
Come on.
Uh, I'll wait here.

592
01:06:25,197 --> 01:06:29,097
Oh, for God's sake,
don't be such a girl.

593
01:07:16,248 --> 01:07:18,387
Who's the man in black?
- Who cares?

594
01:07:18,551 --> 01:07:21,486
He's kicking Superman's ass.

595
01:07:52,084 --> 01:07:53,789
This is starting
to look familiar.

596
01:07:53,953 --> 01:07:57,759
Yeah, only I'm in no mood
for another funeral.

597
01:07:57,923 --> 01:07:59,481
Whoa!

598
01:08:54,914 --> 01:08:56,418
You're out of shape.

599
01:08:56,582 --> 01:08:59,210
Do tell.

600
01:09:16,969 --> 01:09:19,494
Wow. That almost hurt.

601
01:09:21,173 --> 01:09:23,045
Look, why prolong this?

602
01:09:23,209 --> 01:09:25,447
I could keep this
up all day, but you...

603
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:27,849
Why not fly on out of here
while you still can?

604
01:09:28,013 --> 01:09:30,752
And leave the city in
your hands? Not likely.

605
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:32,621
But don't you get it?

606
01:09:32,785 --> 01:09:34,582
I am you, Superman.

607
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:37,426
A reflection of you
as you might have been.

608
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,761
If I were raised by Luthor?

609
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:41,756
If you were strong.

610
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:47,202
You're self-righteous, misguided,
my reflection in a cracked mirror.

611
01:09:47,366 --> 01:09:49,266
Suit yourself.

612
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,712
What happened to
"camera on the action"?

613
01:09:56,876 --> 01:09:59,336
The story's that way. Whoa!

614
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:05,875
Now it is.

615
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:31,691
I guess this time I'll need
to see to it that you stay dead.

616
01:11:22,962 --> 01:11:26,802
Now tell me, who's better equipped
to protect Metropolis?

617
01:11:26,966 --> 01:11:28,703
You have all my strengths...

618
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,727
...and my weaknesses.

619
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:06,460
Pro...

620
01:12:06,839 --> 01:12:08,397
Protect...

621
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:10,405
Protect the people.

622
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:12,890
It's why I'm here.

623
01:12:18,484 --> 01:12:22,924
If you're a robot or another damn clone
or something, I swear to God...

624
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:25,386
It's really me, Lois.

625
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,524
I'm back.

626
01:12:27,693 --> 01:12:30,773
Like I haven't
heard that before.

627
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:34,157
I may need some proof.

628
01:12:42,674 --> 01:12:46,405
Okay. I'm convinced.
- I'm glad.

629
01:12:47,846 --> 01:12:52,010
But I'm not sure
they'll ever trust me again.

630
01:12:52,173 --> 01:12:53,311
They will.

631
01:12:53,485 --> 01:12:55,817
It may take some time.

632
01:12:57,723 --> 01:12:59,928
Are you gonna wear
the red and blue suit again?

633
01:13:00,092 --> 01:13:02,163
Because I like
that one better.

634
01:13:02,327 --> 01:13:05,067
Or not very much time at all.

635
01:13:19,711 --> 01:13:22,441
Mm. Do I smell coffee?

636
01:13:22,614 --> 01:13:25,742
Fresh pot. I'm
almost done here.

637
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,491
There's only one
S in resurrection.

638
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,861
Didn't realize proofreading
was one of your super-powers.

639
01:13:33,025 --> 01:13:34,458
Well, no.

640
01:13:34,626 --> 01:13:39,886
But I was the spelling-bee champ
of Smallville Elementary.

641
01:13:41,433 --> 01:13:43,298
Clark.

642
01:13:48,907 --> 01:13:51,987
Don't forget to
call your mother.

643
01:14:17,269 --> 01:14:21,309
<i>If history has
determined that gods can die...</i>

644
01:14:21,473 --> 01:14:27,153
<i>...it has also proven
that they may return from the dead.</i>

645
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:32,779
<i>It would seem you cant be
destroyed after all, Superman.</i>

646
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:35,812
<i>It would seem.</i>
