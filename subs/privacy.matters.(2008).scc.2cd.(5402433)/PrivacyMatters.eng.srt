1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,900
Yes, that sounds like fun...

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,900
Right, do that, ok?

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,900
Sorry love, I have to go.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,900
Yes? Okay, see you tonight.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,900
That's okay, yes, do that.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,900
Kiss... bye love.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
PRIVATNOST JE BITNA

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,900
Sorry about that...

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,900
I am pretty set on my privacy.

11
00:00:47,935 --> 00:00:49,900
Like most people I think.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,965
We live in a country where we can do what we want...

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,900
Where we're not being listened in on,
where you don't go to jail

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,900
when you do or say something 'wrong'.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,900
This is what happens in certain corrupt countries or dictatorships
where there is no freedom of expression.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,900
Where leaders keep a close eye on their people...

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,900
and deprive them of their freedom.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,900
Fortunately, we are safe, as long as we comply
with the law and have nothing to hide.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,900
We can do whatever we want, we are not being monitored.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,900
At least, that's what we think...

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,700
You probably have no idea,
that we're also being monitored.

22
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,150
Being watched and recorded at work and...

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,900
in our private life at millions of our daily actions
and transactions. We are being watched and analysed by...

24
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,900
the government and corporations.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The more they know about us...

26
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,900
the better they can predict how we react to new
products, ads and prices.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,900
That's why corporations put together complex physical
data like our expenditures and our behaviour.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,900
Everytime somebody clicks an internet
link, dials a number...

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,900
uses a credit card, loyalty card
or a public transport card...

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,900
that person adds important and personal
information to their own data record.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,900
To make this work in todays compatitive consumermarket...

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,300
companies seek the razors edge of hidden techniques
to accomplish this.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,900
Take for example this loyalty card...

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,900
in this case I'm being defined by what I buy as...

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,900
male, young, rich, healthy...

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,900
But perhaps also... impulsive and gullible

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,900
and A plus B equals C?

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,900
Corporations make nice promises in their
privacy statemens...

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,900
But this will always loose out in favour of
the revenues

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,900
Therefore it is very difficult to protect your
privacy against companies and the government

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,900
In the fight against crime the government
can always just get this information.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,900
There is even an EU directive that requires phone
companies and internet service providers to...

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,200
store the traffic data of every call and every email...

44
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,900
for a minimum of 6 months and a maximum period of 2 years.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,900
This creates an incredibly penetrating tool to find
out with whom you've had contact and where you've been.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,900
So the data about the call I made this afternoon
has been recorded and is being retained.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,900
It looks like every piece of information by
itself is not that important.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,900
But all the pieces of the puzzle are put together to
look into on our lives and personal networks.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,900
Unfortunately this is being done by machines...

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,900
raizing the possiblility a very distorted picture is formed.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,900
With the correct use of all this information,
terrorism and crime can be put to a halt, but...

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,900
we've also seen it can go wrong.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,900
When a researcher was looking for heavy water, and
he lived in the same street as a Muslim...

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,900
they both and their whole street were put under surveillance.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,900
The system missed the fact that the teacher
was a chemistry teacher.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,900
Human common sense was replaced with a system
created from patterns and by machines.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,400
Dumb systems catch stupid criminals.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,900
Since terrorist attacks are extremely rare
and since there is no clear profile...

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,900
even the most accurate systems will be flooded with
with false alarms in such a way...

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,900
that they will be rendered useless because
they look for recurring patterns to predict and...

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,900
to prevent future events from happening.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,900
The expected pattern even makes us...

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,900
watch the skies, while the bombs are
placed in trains.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,900
Smart criminals can use this to their advantage.

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,900
No system is foolproof and criminals are eager
to discover its vulnerabilities.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,900
With CCTV camera's that watch our every move...

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,900
our right to privacy; our right
to be left alone... has been replaced

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,900
with the thought that you might be a potential criminal.

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,900
This method has our consent because we got afraid after
the terrorist attacks in New York, London and Madrid.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,900
In this Kafka-eske society we've been
transformed from people into objects.

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,900
What happened to the biggest principle of democracy?

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,900
Innocent until proven guilty!

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,900
Privacy isn't meant to be a cover for your sins.

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,900
Privacy is all about who has information
on you and what they can do with it.

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,900
Therefore you must be aware of
what information is collected

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,900
Checking means everything.

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,900
In London citizens are being filmed by CCTV
camera's up to 300 times a day.

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,900
These camera's grow in numbers and shrink in size.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,900
"I've got nothing to hide" you think...

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,900
"so I've got nothing to be afraid of. "

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,900
But the people we've elected to lead us...

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,900
more oftenly decide their rights in private...

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,900
their systems kept hidden and we're being
watched behind closed doors...

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,900
This growth in gathering of information will in the end
deprive us of our feeling of freedom.

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,900
Even to the point that it will prevent us to function
in our role as citizen, company or government.

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,900
Individual power will be surplanted with a
kind of herd mentality of us vs. them.

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,500
During the industrial revolution people saw the damage of
greed and smashed the machines to pieces...

88
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,900
with iron bars and billets.

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,900
This... is not the solution.

90
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,900
The endless development of technology...

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,900
must be put to good use, to create an
unsurpassed service to consumers.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,900
And then the corporations must make
and keep a promise to do good.

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,900
Laptops with sensitive data are
being stolen from cars...

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,900
back-ups are being lost...

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,900
and hackers break into databases...

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,300
even into the Pentagon.

97
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,900
With employees peeping into files and laptops
which are lost this can lead...

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,900
to a huge invasion of privacy and identity theft.

99
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,500
We live in a technology driven revolution.

100
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,300
More complex calculations create even higher
levels of control.

101
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,600
Every electronic transaction, communication
and change is recorded.

102
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,900
Security companies install, promote
and control access to...

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,900
data networks of incredible capacity.

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,900
Sensitive and complex formulas filter
all aspects of our private lives.

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,900
We are human.

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,900
The seperation between private and public is
the foundation of our democracy.

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,900
As citizens we are giving away our rights...

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,900
without the possibility of asking questions
about the methods used...

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,900
on how our data is being used...

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,900
or who has access to it.

111
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,900
How efficient is it to record all the moves
of everybody on the internet...

112
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,900
to catch just a hand full of criminals?

113
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,900
How is our financial status of
any relevance when we travel?

114
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,900
But above all, do we achieve the
intended result with all these rules?

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,900
Be critical.

116
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,900
We are not obligated to leave all
our personal data...

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,900
and certainly not forever.

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,300
Use your given democratic right to be critical
of the direction chosen by your government.

119
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,900
Discussion this with your representatives.

120
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,900
Take action.

121
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,650
Ask questions.

122
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,900
Stay aware.
