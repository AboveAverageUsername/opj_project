A FILM BY ISAO YUKISADA

2
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:17,573
3:00 AM, March 12th

3
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,216
Crab. Why not.

4
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:30,521
It's freezing!

6
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:49,008
Me too!

7
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:50,949
Kate, you're awake.

8
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:52,052
Uh-huh.

9
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:53,378
Where are we?

10
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,045
Takatsuki pit stop.

11
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,956
Really? You never use the highway.

12
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:03,291
Well, you two were sleeping like logs,
so I thought ' rest area'.

13
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,356
I was getting kinda bored too.

14
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:08,366
Sorry! Just when did I doze off?

15
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:09,696
The second we left.

16
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:16,335
By the time I turned two corners and hit
East Ohji street, you were both out.

17
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:20,507
I asked if anyone wanted anything.
No replies.

18
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:21,711
Really?

19
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,446
Lonely were we? Poor baby.

20
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,419
So, the toll's on you.

21
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:31,319
What?!

22
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,359
What'd you expect? I'm a poor student.

23
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,223
Make Maki pay half.

24
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,065
Counting your pennies!

25
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,497
Cheap!

26
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,972
That sums you up!

27
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:04,925
God, I envy Masamichi though.

28
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:08,352
I'd kill to live and study in Kyoto.

29
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,896
Know what you mean.
The place has that academic aura...

30
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:15,092
Imagine, parties every night...

31
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:19,569
Which is the only thing on your mind.
Think you scared Kawachi off today.

32
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,335
You think so too?

33
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,970
But he's so cute, irresistible!

34
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:33,553
Oh, and y'know what?
He's going to take me out on a date!

35
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:37,521
Bet you threatened him.
The poor kid can't say "no".

36
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,851
And I told you he's got a girlfriend.

37
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:43,623
Don't care. I just wanna get
to know him better.

38
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:47,894
And who's the one acting like
the world's about to end every time?

39
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,294
I'm not looking after you, got it?

40
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,701
All history. Better luck this time.

41
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:15,923
Are you ok down there? Sleepy yet?

42
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:21,692
I'm fine. I'm a night person.

43
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,301
Hang in there, all right?

44
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,404
Yes.

45
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,268
Um...

46
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:32,703
What is it?

47
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,939
Can you really get me outta here?

48
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:44,613
Don't worry.

49
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,386
We're all pros up here.

50
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:53,526
Bad news. The owner of the building's
totally pissed off.

51
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,559
Says he doesn't want to see a scratch.

52
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,095
Damn.

53
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,170
I know.

54
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:03,037
This sucks.

55
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,138
Excuse me...

56
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:08,672
Yes?

57
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:12,445
Do you think I can get a smoke?

58
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,080
A cigarette?

59
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:14,845
Yes.

60
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:17,490
Sure. Coming right down.

61
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,750
Sorry.

62
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,360
Hey!

63
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:29,767
Mr. Kawasaki?

64
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:30,665
Yes?

65
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:34,968
We're using the rod again.
Try to catch it, ok?

66
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:36,465
Yes.

67
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:52,325
How's that?

68
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,552
Almost there.

69
00:04:59,032 --> 00:04:59,589
Got it?

70
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,997
Yes it's...

71
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,535
Ouch!

72
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,295
Hot!

73
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,505
Are you ok?

74
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:12,169
Ok? This is dangerous!

75
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,145
Now!!

76
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:24,119
Menthol, sweet...

77
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:30,823
Guess that's it.

78
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:32,727
Yes.

79
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,501
Let's go.

80
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,475
Think I can sell it?

81
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,450
Forget it. Let's go home and
take a bath.

82
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,423
It's over. Let's go home.

83
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:02,824
Yeah.

84
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:42,488
Will you stop that?
It's not the end of the world.

85
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:49,599
I'm sad. I'm devastated.
It was the cutest skirt.

86
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:54,296
And it would've looked amazing
on me too.

87
00:07:54,441 --> 00:08:00,277
That skirt had my name written on it.
So why am I not wearing it, huh?

88
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:02,974
Why? Huh?

89
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,477
Ok, ok, I get it.

90
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,883
No, you don't, Nakazawa.

91
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:14,457
I found it yesterday
on the way back from work.

92
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:19,327
Went to the bank in the morning and
straight to the shop.

93
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,997
And it was already gone!!

94
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:25,499
I ran! And the length was perfect!

95
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,773
That skirt was so completely ME!

96
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,834
But it's just a skirt.
You bought one the other day.

97
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,038
Can't you see I'm depressed?

98
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,271
Leave me alone.

99
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,647
Well, you could've asked them
to keep it for you.

100
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,257
I know that. Why are you telling me this?

101
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:47,788
I really, really wanted that skirt!

102
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,895
Why don't you go and get it for me!

103
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:51,395
Huh?

104
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,761
Do something!

105
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,767
Calm down, Maki.

106
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,235
Nakazawa, you idiot! Keep quiet!

107
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,170
You shut up, idiot!

108
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,479
Here? This one?

109
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:22,184
Kawaramachi, Kyoto

110
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,691
It's probably down there.

111
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,666
Oh yeah. Wait a sec.

112
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,397
And we're here.

113
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:36,736
Thanks.

114
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:48,810
It's this way. Let's go.

115
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,153
This is heavy...

116
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,417
Hurry up.

117
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,427
You carry it Nakazawa.

118
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:56,358
Too heavy.

119
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:57,724
Help her.

120
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:58,922
Why me?

121
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,828
Help her!

122
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,935
Let's go, Maki!

123
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,265
Kate!

124
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,532
Hey!

125
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,012
Hi guys!

126
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,513
Hey!

127
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,919
So this is it. Very nice!

128
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:23,749
Yeah, good feel to it,
but the draft's a killer.

129
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,414
Thought I'd freeze to death.

130
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,623
Oh, sure.

131
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:29,452
Here.

132
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,727
What's this? I'm not sick.

133
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,526
Her fault.

134
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:34,292
Shut up.

135
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:35,731
Come in.

136
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,462
To your truly humble abode!

137
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,669
Hey! Don't break anything!

138
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,776
It's slippery!

139
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:47,437
Good evening.

140
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,304
Good evening.

141
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,110
Nice place.

142
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,279
Hi!

143
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:59,651
To Masamichi, for his new home and
his new graduate life!

144
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:00,688
Cheers!

145
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,227
Cheers!

146
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,660
Cheers!

147
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,099
I wanna drink too.

148
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,032
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

149
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:11,661
Thanks.

150
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,365
Congratulations!

151
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,442
Here, try this.

152
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:29,182
It's delicious!

153
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,254
Really?

154
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:36,719
Yeah, it's amazing!
You made this all on your own?

155
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,490
Kawachi helped out.

156
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,695
I knew it!

157
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,639
Seriously, Masamichi.

158
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:51,073
I had no idea you could cook.
You're a genius!

159
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,882
Eye candy...

160
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:01,610
I think we have enough booze already.
Unless you have a death wish.

161
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,552
We're celebrating! Give us a break!

162
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,716
But I have to look after you guys.

163
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,894
Don't you worry.
Kawachi'll look after me tonight.

164
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:11,995
Won't you?

165
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,725
And Maki, what happened to your
depression, huh?

166
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:21,000
You had to bring it up... my skirt...

167
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:24,174
...my beautiful skirt...

168
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:32,846
Now why did you go and do that for,
Nakazawa?

169
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:39,055
Forget about it, sweetie. Eat.
Good food'll cheer you up.

170
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:42,684
And booze'll make you happy.

171
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:46,023
Another! Pour me enough to fill
that skirt!

172
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:51,099
Ok, ok! Drink your fill.
I'll make sure you'll get home.

173
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:55,674
Yes. I'm eating and drinking until
that skirt's out of my brain.

174
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:58,403
Great idea. It's for the best.

175
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,572
Boy, this stuff's good.

176
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,518
Don't you think so, Kawachi?

177
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,387
Yeah.

178
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:20,697
Masamichi's some guy huh?
He can cook,

179
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:25,595
He's sensitive and he's smart too.

180
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,369
Hmm.

181
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:32,909
So! Your blood type's O, isn't it?

182
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:34,104
No, it's AB.

183
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:38,183
Really? But I bet it's close to O.

184
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,283
There's no such thing.

185
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,647
What do think, Kawachi?

186
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,657
I, I don't know...

187
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:57,961
What is that?!

188
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:30,060
C'mon, hurry up!

189
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:37,733
Masamichi's 2 storey house...
Has its own little mouse...

190
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:44,102
This is great. You're pretty good
at this, right?

191
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,405
I'd say I'm ok.

192
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,179
Do you do this a lot?

193
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,909
Well... actually...

194
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:57,580
Not that often. More like once a year.
I cut Nakazawa's last year.

195
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,283
That's all?

196
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,627
Yep.

197
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,064
You're not drunk, are ya?

198
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:10,767
Hey...

199
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,463
Can you trust Maki with scissors?
She's pretty drunk.

200
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,804
She might cut off his ears or something.

201
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,809
Not ears, I hope.

202
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,472
I hope you're right.

203
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,583
That seemed like A LOT of hair!

204
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,957
Don't worry! It's ok!

205
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:37,960
Why are you hiding it?

206
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,588
I said it's ok!

207
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,866
Nishiyama, has she hurt you yet?

208
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,939
Nah. She's cut yours before, right?

209
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,737
Yeah, and what a nightmare that was.

210
00:16:52,879 --> 00:17:00,012
Oh, shut up. The second attempt's gotta
be better than the first!

211
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:05,317
Jeez, you're smashed, aren't you?
It's a scary sight, you and scissors.

212
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,483
What, she's THAT drunk?!

213
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,027
Yeah. Just doesn't show.

214
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:15,965
Oh, don't worry.
I'm being especially careful.

215
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:20,300
Besides, it I screw up,
you can always shave everything off.

216
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,238
It's the 'in' thing anyway. Trendy.

217
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,105
That's no good.

218
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:32,146
Just leave us alone, ok?
I'll play with you once I'm done.

219
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:35,116
Huh? I'm only showing concern.

220
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:42,324
Well, I'm doing a good job so go away.
You tell him, err...

221
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:43,524
I'm Nishiyama.

222
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:48,066
See, Nishiyama trusts me completely.

223
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:51,802
Not if I'm going to end up bald,
though...

224
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,769
Be careful.

225
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,542
Aw!

226
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,203
You ok?

227
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,306
You poked me with the scissors!!

228
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,213
Oops, sorry!

229
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:07,853
Good luck.

230
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,280
Think I'm bleeding.

231
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,584
Oh, you're funny!

232
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:23,533
Doesn't it feel like you're inside
an egg when you're drunk?

233
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,134
No?

234
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,863
An egg?

235
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,037
We're off to the store.

236
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:33,372
I'll go, Masamichi.

237
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:35,981
Nah, you're the guest.

238
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:43,852
Not chicken eggs, mind you.

239
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:48,751
Not those hard-shelled ones.
Eggs with no shells.

240
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,760
Kawachi, that's her usual pick-up line.

241
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,560
Is that so?

242
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:59,971
Leave me alone. It's what I think.

243
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,967
An egg, yes?

244
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,714
It's over there!

245
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:20,723
Where?

246
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,954
There! Right there!

247
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:29,834
Well, I'll be damned!

248
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,427
It's a whale!

249
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,002
Honey, is it still alive?

250
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,538
Yes. It's still breathing.

251
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,873
Breathing?!

252
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:44,343
It's alive! It's breathing!

253
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,179
Really? Where? Here?

254
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,624
Oh my God!

255
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:13,207
Put the rope around your shoulders.

256
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:14,977
Yes.

257
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,518
I'm ready.

258
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,961
Mr. Kawasaki! We're going to try and
pull you up now. Good luck.

259
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:30,960
Yes.

260
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:33,163
1-2-3!!

261
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,663
Aw! Aw! Aw!

262
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:37,261
Are you ok?

263
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,668
Yes, sorry. I'm fine. Go ahead.

264
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,240
We need you to work with us.

265
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,865
I'm sorry.

266
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,241
Does it hurt?

267
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:53,715
Er, yes, a little,
but I think I can manage.

268
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:58,887
Y'know, Nakazawa's always talking
about you at the lab.

269
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:05,394
...My girlfriend's the cutest...
My girlfriend's the sweetest...

270
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,066
...She's got a great heart...

271
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:12,567
Everyone in class calls you Maki
though they've never met you.

272
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:18,041
Really? You're making me nervous now!

273
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:29,052
The girls at the lab envy you.
They want to be adored like that.

274
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:34,119
And they asked me to take a close look
at you today.

275
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,929
If it were me though,
I wouldn't say as much.

276
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:45,026
I think words have more weight when
they're few and far between.

277
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:54,441
It doesn't bother me.
I'm flattered every single time.

278
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:00,644
It's true I'm so used to it that
sometimes I get tired of it,

279
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,550
But if that's what he thinks of me,

280
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:08,353
I'd rather hear it.
Who doesn't want compliments?

281
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,521
Nakazawa's one lucky guy.

282
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,065
...Meaning?

283
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:16,691
Nothing.

284
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:24,005
I'm just not blessed like he is.
I wish someone'd say that to me.

285
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:28,272
Maki.

286
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,111
Rate me.

287
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:34,948
I don't know.

288
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:39,116
70 out of 100?

289
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:43,921
A little less?

290
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:52,969
So, I think this what it feels like
to be inside an egg.

291
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:59,110
Not a bird's egg but a tadpole's egg
or something like that.

292
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:01,406
A tadpole egg?

293
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:13,590
Don't you agree, Kawachi?
Like you're inside a tadpole's egg?

294
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:17,319
A tadpole, yes?

295
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:21,659
No such thing. Tadpoles are frog eggs.

296
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,157
Huh?

297
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:28,936
But tadpoles come out of them,
so they have to be tadpole eggs.

298
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:33,239
They ultimately become frogs.
That should make them frog eggs.

299
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:37,076
But they're before the tadpole stage
so...

300
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,947
Well, we say chicken eggs,
but not chick eggs.

301
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:49,327
Kawachi... What do you think?

302
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:55,127
I'm sorry, I really wouldn't know 'cos
alcohol tends to make me queasy.

303
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:59,231
But I think bird's egg is closer.

304
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:05,740
You do get what I mean by egg, though?

305
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:15,816
Yes? Wonder what it would feel like if
it was a bird's egg.

306
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:23,354
Think it's fun? Could be fun.

307
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:32,095
Kawachi?!

308
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:36,842
What's wrong with him?

309
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:46,415
Where's Nakazawa and Masamichi?

310
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:49,254
Went to get food.

311
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:51,320
Oh.

312
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:52,524
What?

313
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:57,519
You ok there, Kawachi?

314
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,023
What's up with her?

315
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:06,563
Second attempt's gotta be better
than the first!

316
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,042
What?

317
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:14,043
Nothing.

318
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:22,946
Man, what a loser!

319
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,952
He really looks the type
who'd get trapped.

320
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:33,028
What's up with his hair?

321
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:39,095
And what's that on his face?

322
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:45,311
Man trapped between two walls

323
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:49,214
It's getting cold here in Sakai, Osaka...

324
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:54,419
Where the Rescue team continues with
their desperate efforts to free the man.

325
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:55,619
And now...

326
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:57,279
Hey, don't do that!

327
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,219
How do you feel, sir?

328
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:03,656
No fucking comment!!

329
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:06,788
Well, at least he's got stamina...

330
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:13,772
This was a live report from Sakai,
Osaka.

331
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:17,871
And cut!

332
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:22,313
I think I'll shoot a bit more footage.

333
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:26,748
Fuck this.

334
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:36,958
Hello?

335
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,496
Really?

336
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:43,897
Roger that.

337
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,864
We're on our way.

338
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,097
Yes, yes.

339
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,876
Wrap it up.

340
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,607
Yes.

341
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:03,119
Let's go.

342
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,051
Yes.

343
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:13,064
No! No! No!

344
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:16,592
Take it off.

345
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:21,264
Yes...

346
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:26,807
I'll fold it for you.

347
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:40,522
Don't worry. If I screw up,
you can always shave everything off.

348
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:45,858
I think it's the most masculine
hairstyle anyway.

349
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:51,366
You do? Um, but please
don't cut off my ears...

350
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:01,679
Ok, people! Here we go!

351
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:03,708
1-2-3!!

352
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,394
God, it's huge!

353
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,462
What is it?

354
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:19,689
Start shooting.

355
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:45,422
What happened here?

356
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,752
That guy fell and got stuck.

357
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,987
That's a person?!

358
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,058
What an idiot!

359
00:28:55,334 --> 00:29:00,738
The place was swarming with TV crews,
but they all seem to have took off.

360
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:04,265
I think I'd better get going too.

361
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:08,208
Have to watch the news, right Marie?

362
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,781
We're leaving.

363
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,214
Bye.

364
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:14,511
Bye.

365
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:21,188
Excuse me?

366
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:22,624
You're alive?

367
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,690
Where is everyone?

368
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:30,726
Find them yourself.

369
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,029
Myself?

370
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:33,632
Hey, wait!

371
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:36,705
Wait, I said!

372
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:39,603
So, um...

373
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:43,672
What is it that you like
about Nakazawa?

374
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:52,156
I'm not really sure.
I don't think about it much.

375
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:56,960
Is that how it usually is?

376
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:02,325
Hmm, I guess so. Why?

377
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:05,668
Well, I've got some problems.

378
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:12,038
Just today, I did something and
my girlfriend stormed off, furious.

379
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:16,210
Oh... Right...

380
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,841
And there goes Kate's crush.

381
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:20,951
What's that?

382
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:30,062
Well, let's see. Things like that are
difficult to put into words, I think.

383
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:34,689
Unless you're Kate or Nakazawa, that is.

384
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:40,067
He's just honest. To the point that
his classmates have to buy ear plugs.

385
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:46,969
I'm worried he may be saying things that
should stay private.

386
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,745
I sure know a lot.

387
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,884
Like what?

388
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:05,690
Hey, where's Maki?

389
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:07,965
Bathroom.

390
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,194
Oh.

391
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,727
You look refreshed.

392
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:13,995
Yeah?

393
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,985
Hey! Wake up,
you're gonna catch a cold.

394
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:45,660
Oh my God! You look even cuter!

395
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:49,306
She's right. Nice job, Maki.

396
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:50,236
Think so?

397
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,276
Nishiyama's was a disaster, though.

398
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:05,251
This whale may be a warning
sent by God.

399
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:11,058
People will eventually be left stranded.

400
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:16,030
That is the message I'm seeing here...

401
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:19,495
You okay?

402
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:26,177
So this is how the world goes...

403
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,782
Yeah. It can be a pretty shitty place.

404
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:35,844
The ecosystem is deteriorating...

405
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:41,617
Ban Whale Fishing
Save the Whales

406
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:50,727
Poor thing...

407
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:05,109
Excuse me. Were you the one who first
found the whale? Can I interview you?

408
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,643
Um, that's... that's me, yes!

409
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:15,727
Wow, is this TV? Which channel?

410
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,186
So, how did it get here?

411
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:23,267
How? Oh, the whale. Um, well...

412
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,867
Not bad, Maki.

413
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,369
See?

414
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,632
I got you some dessert.

415
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:36,239
Ah, Masamichi, great timing.

416
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:39,111
I was just beginning to feel a bit hungry.

417
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,378
What do you think, Masamichi?

418
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,318
Looks good.

419
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:46,915
See?

420
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:50,188
Wanna haircut too?

421
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,401
A UFO special again?!

422
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:06,376
Hey, where's the news?

423
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,911
What about the guy who's trapped?

424
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,680
Masamichi, let's play PS2 upstairs.

425
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:17,378
Sure.

426
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,853
I'm in.

427
00:34:18,991 --> 00:34:19,753
Let's go.

428
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:21,983
Me too.

429
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,589
Kawachi...

430
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:39,608
You believe in UFOs?

431
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:41,644
Huh?

432
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,375
I don't know.

433
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,016
I'm joining 'em.

434
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:56,455
Huh?

435
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:57,994
Weirdo.

436
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:02,562
Kawachi's cute.

437
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:06,135
That's why I asked Nakazawa to
have him over.

438
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,397
Is that so?

439
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:14,607
I saw him last fall when I went to see
Nakazawa at his college.

440
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:22,482
Looks like he has a girlfriend, but it'd
be a waste not to try getting closer.

441
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:26,388
So, you knew.

442
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:33,791
Yeah, but I got to talk to him quite
a lot today, so I'm happy.

443
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:39,632
But he's the type who goes bald.

444
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:42,532
You thought so too?

445
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:45,574
It didn't look good.

446
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:47,376
Didn't.

447
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:53,549
But it's ok. 'Cos if it's between a cute
bald guy and an ugly hairball,

448
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:59,123
I'd definitely go for the bald one.
There are lots of cool bald men.

449
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:03,325
And I bet he still has a good 10 years
before it happens.

450
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:07,159
Guess you're right. I'll go for the
bald & handsome too.

451
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:11,666
But I'd feel sad if it was Nakazawa.

452
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:19,571
You needn't worry. Both his granddad
and father have beautiful grey hair.

453
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:20,609
Yeah?

454
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:22,705
Good.

455
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:29,747
This was supposed to be our secret but...

456
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:39,520
He actually knew you before you
officially met. He asked me to set him up.

457
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:41,559
He did?

458
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:43,092
Yep.

459
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:49,037
And that's how I got him to invite
Kawachi today, he owed me.

460
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:55,106
So, that's what happened.
Didn't have a clue.

461
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:59,873
Y'know, it's as if he has to
tell me everything...

462
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:03,680
But it's like I don't know anything
about Nakazawa.

463
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:08,755
Maybe it's better if we're like you two.

464
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:12,096
Be honest. No fights.

465
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:17,759
Seriously?

466
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:22,671
We just can't get rid of
each other, y'know.

467
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:29,412
If that's how you really want it,
I can have a long talk with him.

468
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:36,351
No more compliments,
no holding hands, though.

469
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:38,853
That won't do.

470
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:40,425
See?

471
00:37:41,193 --> 00:37:47,792
Besides, I saw you grinning when they
told you how he'd go on and on about you.

472
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,398
You noticed?

473
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,058
Hard to miss.

474
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:55,234
But hey, you're happy. That's good.

475
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:58,769
And I hope you'll be happy soon.

476
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:06,443
Rest assured. I'm gonna lead a
happy life surrounded by cute boys!

477
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,257
Hey, that's mine.

478
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,597
Hand me volume 6.

479
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:30,367
Thanks.

480
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,108
Hey, don't!

481
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:36,613
Earthquake!

482
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:38,482
Fuck this.

483
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,948
Cheers!

484
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,495
Kawachi.

485
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:00,271
Are you playing PS2?

486
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:03,932
Yes, Three Kingdoms.
But Nishiyama's asleep.

487
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:07,240
Three Kingdoms?!

488
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,751
Don't laugh!

489
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:22,624
What's wrong?

490
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:27,189
Oh, Kate's severely traumatized
by Three Kingdoms.

491
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:35,004
She and her ex were really into the game.
But after an all-nighter,

492
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,008
They broke up over it.

493
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,073
Sugawara.

494
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:51,980
Vowed that we were going to
unify China together.

495
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:57,924
But the bastard cheated.
He bribed my General,

496
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:00,996
While I was in the toilet,

497
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,431
And unified the Kingdoms on his own!

498
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:12,433
Poor girl, he betrayed you!

499
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:17,739
Yes! Unification's mine! I can feel it!

500
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,044
I'm dead.

501
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,111
Shit...

502
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:26,989
Isn't that horrible?

503
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,553
Kawachi?

504
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,922
I wanted to unify China too!!

505
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,859
Sure... um...

506
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:39,966
I... Excuse me!

507
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,266
Kawachi!

508
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:58,119
I should at least get him to take me out.

509
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,380
Go for it.

510
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,764
Meanwhile, I'm going upstairs.

511
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:46,629
The ice cream was delicious.
I ended up eating two.

512
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:50,639
You ate mine too? And Masamichi's?

513
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,308
He's been busy playing host all day,
no time to eat.

514
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,374
I'll get some for him later.

515
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:00,473
No. You can barely move.

516
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:04,281
You know everything about me,
don't you?

517
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:11,521
Wonder if Kate's still hitting
on Kawachi.

518
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:16,095
She's going to ask him out.

519
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:22,336
Think it'll be ok? Feels she's setting
herself up for another heartbreak.

520
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:26,841
What, not much chance there?

521
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:31,745
You shouldn't have invited him, then.

522
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:37,054
I didn't think it was a hopeless case.

523
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:41,090
And besides, Kate insisted. Told me
she didn't care if he wasn't interested.

524
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,061
She practically threatened me.

525
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:54,999
It's nothing new anyway. She'll be
depressed but will get over it as usual.

526
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,140
I'm sure she'll find someone new.

527
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:03,577
I really hope she finds the one,
though.

528
00:43:03,715 --> 00:43:07,344
Yeah. Kate's a sweet girl.

529
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:19,321
I feel like a tadpole egg.

530
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,190
China is unified!

531
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:25,130
Damn!

532
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,363
I'm a genius.

533
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:30,366
New game?

534
00:43:30,508 --> 00:43:31,998
I'm done.

535
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:43,520
I hope Kate manages to get Kawachi
to take her out.

536
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:56,499
What?

537
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:01,104
You are so cute when
you're sleeping.

538
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:03,932
Yeah?

539
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:31,062
I'll call you.

540
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:32,495
Drive safely.

541
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,501
- Bye!
- Bye!

542
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,311
Thanks for tonight!

543
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:17,209
Well, um yeah, so...

544
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:26,790
It was incredible. I was sitting here
watching the sun go down when...

545
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:30,391
The surface of the sea rose up...

546
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:37,390
Like Godzilla in the film,
the US version? It just came up and...

547
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:50,670
Did Nakazawa and the others leave?

548
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:55,682
What's this?

549
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:56,979
A whale.

550
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:58,188
A whale?

551
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:19,039
The local residents of Ona Beach are
working in the cold to rescue the whale.

552
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:24,939
However, there are limits to what human
hands can do under these circumstances.

553
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,176
Can't they tow it using a boat?

554
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:33,117
They already tried using a fish boat
and a bulldozer.

555
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:34,315
Oh.

556
00:46:37,996 --> 00:46:42,365
Poor thing.
I hope they'll manage to save it.

557
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:44,864
Yeah, hope they do...

558
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:48,797
Nah, these guys are a bunch
of hypocrites.

559
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,129
How do you know?

560
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:55,974
It's obvious. They're desperate 'cos
there's a TV camera. It's pathetic.

561
00:46:56,114 --> 00:47:01,142
Do you think they'd been doing this much
if they found a bum dying on the beach?

562
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:03,784
It's 'cos it's a whale.

563
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:06,220
Man, you are twisted.

564
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:12,692
...Can they save the whale?
This was a live report from Ona.

565
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:22,698
Hey, what happened to the
sandwiched guy?

566
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:24,571
That happened today too?

567
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:29,408
Yeah, got trapped between 2 buildings.
It was hilarious.

568
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:39,747
So much happens in so many places
that we never know about.

569
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:45,059
Masamichi, that's stating the obvious,
don't you think?

570
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,994
I suppose so.

571
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:51,927
You awake?

572
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:54,729
They left?

573
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,737
Yep, went home.

574
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:58,233
Right.

575
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:08,610
Masamichi.

576
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:11,580
Masamichi!

577
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:14,319
Come over here!

578
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:24,568
What's up?

579
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,303
Was I THAT drunk?

580
00:48:27,939 --> 00:48:30,931
Well... you were a little.

581
00:48:32,043 --> 00:48:35,171
And did my hair look like somebody
forgot to finish the hair cut?

582
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:42,180
Guess so. I'm just noticing it now.

583
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:44,851
And what's this line?

584
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:48,152
Beats me.

585
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:52,760
Right...

586
00:49:03,141 --> 00:49:08,738
You look really different, Nishiyama.
How can I put it... It's nice.

587
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,378
Yeah?

588
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:14,415
Yes.

589
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:19,056
Hey!

590
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:21,989
What? What is it?

591
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,193
Easy for you to say.

592
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:36,872
Girls love you no matter
how your hair looks.

593
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:44,104
That's not true. There's only so much
I can do with my hair 'cos of my looks.

594
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:48,484
Your looks?

595
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:56,818
As in, fair skin, long-lashed and big
yet well-proportioned eyes?

596
00:49:56,961 --> 00:50:01,057
Generally handsome looks that girls like?

597
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:07,767
But I'm not really as popular with
the girls as people seem to think.

598
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:12,205
I had my hair cut 'cos I liked what
she did with yours. It's true.

599
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:17,611
So why the hell did yours end up
so neat, whereas mine...

600
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:23,683
Maki was more careful with you 'cos
you're cute. It's pretty obvious.

601
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:25,721
Nishiyama.

602
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:32,620
You can get that fixed at the barber.
It's not, er, hopeless...

603
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:34,253
But that line...

604
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:38,898
It's not his fault, so give him a break.

605
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:42,597
No. These are FACTS!

606
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:47,343
Why are girls interested
in this wimp anyway?

607
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,345
Did you see the way Nakazawa's friend
was flirting with him today?

608
00:50:53,084 --> 00:50:54,176
Who do you think you are?

609
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:59,312
There's no point in taking it out
on Kawachi. Let it go, ok?

610
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:04,457
Wanna have a bite? And talk about
something fun?

611
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,491
All right...

612
00:51:11,202 --> 00:51:12,464
The other room.

613
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:19,075
Sit down.

614
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:24,305
Wanna beer?

615
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:42,256
Um, didn't you go out with a girl
from Geometry? Did you have fun?

616
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:50,097
Well... yeah.

617
00:51:50,308 --> 00:51:51,605
Hey!

618
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,471
Who's this from Geometry?

619
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:59,606
What, you went on a date?
Is she cute? What type?

620
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,989
Will you shut your big mouth?!

621
00:52:10,394 --> 00:52:15,525
Brings back memories best forgotten!
How'd you know anyway?

622
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:24,836
Who told you about it? Bet you already
know what happened! Right? Huh?

623
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:26,600
You fucking with me?

624
00:52:26,711 --> 00:52:28,679
Stop! Stop! Stop!

625
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:30,644
No headlocks! No headlocks!

626
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:35,585
Die! Die! Die!

627
00:52:37,455 --> 00:52:39,923
You're getting the exact same hair cut!

628
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:41,820
Where are the scissors?

629
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:44,484
What're you talking about?

630
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,597
Sit down!

631
00:52:48,733 --> 00:52:49,791
Hey!

632
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:52,463
Sit down!

633
00:52:55,439 --> 00:53:01,139
Know what, Nishiyama?
I think your nap wasn't long enough.

634
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:07,708
Why don't you go back to sleep? I'll get
the futon out for you upstairs. Ok?

635
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:13,483
Don't bother with the futon.

636
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:20,787
Maybe something's made you feel sad,
but that's life.

637
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,123
Actually, today I...

638
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:24,894
Are you talking about that girl?

639
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:25,798
No...

640
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:28,598
Well, that's not the only problem.

641
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:34,467
It's far more complex and
essential than that.

642
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:39,107
I've got issues. You guys just don't know.

643
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,074
Essential? How?

644
00:53:44,622 --> 00:53:45,782
It's complicated.

645
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:02,303
Wanna sleep upstairs?

646
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,135
Call Maki for me.

647
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,469
What for?

648
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:16,910
Ask her why I look like this while
Kawachi looks like that.

649
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:21,318
But I don't know her number.

650
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:26,029
Then call Nakazawa.

651
00:54:27,865 --> 00:54:28,627
What's his number?

652
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,825
Ok, ok.

653
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:34,495
I'll call him. Sit and wait.

654
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:46,850
Hi, Nakazawa?

655
00:54:47,184 --> 00:54:48,742
You home yet?

656
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:50,580
Not yet. What's up?

657
00:54:52,223 --> 00:54:54,691
Well, it's Nishiyama, he...

658
00:54:54,825 --> 00:55:01,458
Nobody gives a rat's ass about me!!
Fuck you!

659
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:07,834
Hear that? Yeah...
Seems like he got dumped again.

660
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:09,269
No!

661
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:13,871
Things are more complicated!

662
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,112
It's apparently complicated.

663
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:18,941
Essential issues!

664
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,581
All tangled!

665
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:26,222
...And tangled.

666
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:37,632
As the morning sun burns Mt. Rokko

667
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:42,664
We look up at the dawning sky

668
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:54,910
It is here where the soul
Of the blue Naniwa lies

669
00:55:56,954 --> 00:56:01,687
The hopes of passionate youths

670
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:08,423
Soaring high up in the heavens

671
00:56:08,566 --> 00:56:09,590
With feet...

672
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:10,290
Mr. Kawasaki?

673
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:11,731
Yes?

674
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,828
I got you some nice hot stew for you.
It'll be down in a minute.

675
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,976
Thank you so much...

676
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,405
Mr. Matsumoto?

677
00:56:26,317 --> 00:56:27,306
Yes?

678
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:29,718
What time is it now?

679
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:34,786
A little past 12:30.

680
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:35,959
Thanks.

681
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:39,896
So it's already tomorrow.

682
00:56:43,234 --> 00:56:44,223
Mr. Kawasaki?

683
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:45,664
Yes?

684
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:50,139
That song, isn't it Nishi Junior High's
Alma Mater?

685
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:54,168
Yes. How did you know?

686
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:58,241
Well, I'm a graduate of
Nishi-Chu myself.

687
00:56:58,983 --> 00:57:01,076
You're kidding me!

688
00:57:01,552 --> 00:57:02,917
It's true.

689
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:08,550
Nah... seriously?

690
00:57:08,692 --> 00:57:09,590
Yes.

691
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:13,624
Can't believe it.

692
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,288
Really?

693
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:18,400
Imoto was my arch enemy.

694
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:22,835
It is true! Unbelievable!

695
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:38,018
What are you doing?

696
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:43,182
What are these?

697
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:46,921
Well...

698
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:53,432
I have this thing for symmetry.

699
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:57,004
Symmetry?

700
00:58:02,546 --> 00:58:05,344
Did that girl from Geometry
teach you that too?

701
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:07,817
No.

702
00:58:11,255 --> 00:58:13,746
Done!

703
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:19,061
Now I'd like you to get me drinks.

704
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:20,422
What drinks?

705
00:58:21,198 --> 00:58:27,831
Booze, coke. Oh and I've got
the munchies. Get me some rice.

706
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:31,099
Wait a sec, you want ME to go?

707
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:34,409
WE don't know where the shop is.

708
00:58:34,545 --> 00:58:36,342
Well yeah, but...

709
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,974
Get some cold tea for me while
you're at it.

710
00:58:44,655 --> 00:58:47,351
Masamichi, I'll go with you.

711
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:48,549
No!

712
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:52,551
You're staying right here with me.

713
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:56,325
We're having a nice cozy chat. Sit down.

714
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,828
Nishiyama...

715
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:02,600
Don't worry. I won't hurt him.

716
00:59:03,841 --> 00:59:04,865
You swear?

717
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,399
It's a promise.

718
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,521
Kawachi.

719
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:25,425
THIS is what you call cute.

720
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:40,298
Masamichi!

721
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,174
Fuck me, it is you!

722
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:51,948
My man Masamichi!

723
00:59:52,222 --> 00:59:56,056
- What're you doing here?
- Hey, this is unexpected!

724
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:58,423
Likewise. What's up?

725
00:59:58,562 --> 01:00:00,553
I moved here last week.

726
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:02,426
Yeah? For work?

727
01:00:02,566 --> 01:00:04,329
No, for my MA.

728
01:00:04,468 --> 01:00:08,063
Argh, still studying hard, huh?

729
01:00:08,472 --> 01:00:09,496
What about you?

730
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:13,701
Still in college, 5th year, no,
make that 6th.

731
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,137
I hardly go there, though.

732
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:21,684
Oh, y'know what? I'm having
a housewarming party right now.

733
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:23,616
Why don't you join us?

734
01:00:23,854 --> 01:00:24,946
Yeah?

735
01:00:26,557 --> 01:00:31,551
Better not. I'm on my way to see my
girlfriend and I'm pretty late as it is.

736
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:32,592
She cute?

737
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:35,390
You know she is!

738
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:39,132
I'll call you. What's your number?

739
01:00:40,571 --> 01:00:42,004
It's 075...

740
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:42,967
What's THAT?!

741
01:00:43,707 --> 01:00:44,696
This?

742
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:47,308
Me and my friend, we burnt them to see
whose would last.

743
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:50,507
I won, which is why mine still works.

744
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:51,909
So, your number?

745
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:58,078
075-5521-1268.

746
01:00:58,388 --> 01:00:59,150
Cell?

747
01:00:59,289 --> 01:01:04,784
090-148-1655.

748
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:06,091
Got it.

749
01:01:06,563 --> 01:01:07,621
It's cold.

750
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:09,730
Hey, your phone's ringing.

751
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:10,925
Oops, sorry.

752
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:15,602
Hello? Hello?

753
01:01:15,873 --> 01:01:16,999
That's my number.

754
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,471
- It's you!
- It's me!

755
01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:19,906
Give me a break!

756
01:01:22,312 --> 01:01:26,681
Wait. Er, what's your name again?

757
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:29,375
Oh, c'mon!

758
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,681
It's Ya-ma-da!

759
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,015
That's it!

760
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:39,528
The hopes of passionate youths

761
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:45,396
Soaring high up in the heavens

762
01:01:45,536 --> 01:01:49,939
With feet firmly on the ground

763
01:01:50,507 --> 01:01:55,069
Let us commit to our future

764
01:01:55,812 --> 01:02:00,272
Oh, Nishi-Chu

765
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:05,979
Our beloved school

766
01:03:43,754 --> 01:03:44,846
Hello?

767
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:49,488
Hello. Were you still up?

768
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:51,426
Yeah.

769
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:55,564
I'm getting beer for the guys.

770
01:03:59,136 --> 01:04:01,104
You're still awake too.

771
01:04:02,472 --> 01:04:05,805
Yes. I'm working on my paper.

772
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:10,341
Poor you.

773
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,350
So how's Kyoto?

774
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,159
Can't really tell yet.

775
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,290
Right...

776
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,196
So what are you doing now?

777
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:39,339
Nothing much. Right now,
I'm near the Kamo River.

778
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:43,007
At this hour?

779
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:51,211
Isn't Kamo connected to Yodo River?

780
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:53,048
It is?

781
01:04:55,325 --> 01:05:03,926
I think. You'd probably be able to come
to my house by boat from there.

782
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:08,337
Where do you live again?

783
01:05:09,106 --> 01:05:14,942
By Yodo, near the harbor. I can see
the waters from the window.

784
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:16,872
Hmm.

785
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:24,546
Maybe I'll do that. On a boat.
Right up to your place.

786
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:27,046
Why?

787
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:32,455
Well... now that you ask, I'm not sure.

788
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:42,828
Hey, why don't you come to see me?

789
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:50,046
You can take the train.
All you have to do is sit.

790
01:05:55,786 --> 01:05:57,310
Maybe not.

791
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:00,317
It's nice, Kyoto.

792
01:06:03,193 --> 01:06:06,856
You just said you weren't sure what
to make of it.

793
01:06:08,732 --> 01:06:12,099
Well, I'd say it's got good vibes.

794
01:06:14,104 --> 01:06:16,197
The Kamo River too.

795
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,739
Like how?

796
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,303
Can't put it into words.

797
01:06:25,949 --> 01:06:27,143
Sounds fun.

798
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,475
I'm jealous.

799
01:06:32,689 --> 01:06:34,213
Then, come.

800
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:44,592
Nah. I figured it'd be more fun
than working on my paper.

801
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:47,363
So you're not done yet.

802
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:52,102
You want to do it for me?

803
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:56,434
Sure. If you bring it here.

804
01:07:01,885 --> 01:07:03,182
Forget it then.

805
01:07:07,824 --> 01:07:12,022
I think I should get back to it anyway.
I have to turn it in tomorrow.

806
01:07:14,297 --> 01:07:15,229
Oh. Ok.

807
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:21,670
Come to see me sometime, ok?

808
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:30,268
I'll think about it.

809
01:07:32,883 --> 01:07:37,081
In the not too distant future.

810
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:44,484
Dunno.

811
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:48,464
Bye.

812
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:14,790
Shit...

813
01:08:19,296 --> 01:08:20,354
Hello?

814
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:27,129
Where the hell are you, dude? You're
gone forever and then your cell's busy.

815
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:30,271
Sorry. I was taking a break.

816
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,574
We're going to go eat crab.

817
01:08:33,176 --> 01:08:34,200
What?

818
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:40,577
Crab. Straight from the Sea of Japan.
Kinosaki. We're leaving now.

819
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:44,585
Leaving now? How?

820
01:08:45,255 --> 01:08:49,692
By car, you idiot.
Yamada's gonna drive us there.

821
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:53,724
Yamada? How come you know him?

822
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:59,166
I don't. He called, we started talking
and we just kinda decided to go.

823
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:02,093
Nice guy.

824
01:09:03,907 --> 01:09:07,741
His relatives own this inn so
we're getting a discount.

825
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,135
But why now?

826
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:16,510
Why not now? Don't you want to eat crab?
Either way's fine, we can go without you.

827
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:19,281
Ok, ok, I'll go.

828
01:09:19,589 --> 01:09:20,886
Hurry up.

829
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:22,613
Alright.

830
01:09:28,865 --> 01:09:32,164
Crab. Why not.

831
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:54,784
Me too!

832
01:09:55,325 --> 01:09:56,758
Kate, you're awake.

833
01:09:56,893 --> 01:09:59,157
Yep. Where are we?

834
01:10:00,263 --> 01:10:01,753
Takatsuki pit stop.

835
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:04,732
Really? You never use the highway.

836
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:08,998
Well, you two were sleeping like logs,
so I thought ' rest area'.

837
01:10:15,345 --> 01:10:18,872
Oh, did you hear about Tetsu?

838
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:19,809
Tetsu?

839
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:23,776
Akiko texted me.

840
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:27,719
Akiko? You mean Tetsu's
first-kiss Akiko?

841
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:31,156
Who else? Anyway.

842
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:34,763
The casino lounge he was working for
apparently got busted.

843
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:35,728
No way!

844
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:40,032
This afternoon. Probably got arrested.

845
01:10:41,004 --> 01:10:44,838
It's kinda sad, shame, really.

846
01:10:45,141 --> 01:10:49,976
I always thought Tetsu was
headlines material.

847
01:10:50,113 --> 01:10:54,243
I know. Stealing a truck at
the tender age of 9?

848
01:10:54,918 --> 01:11:00,550
And making it as far as Noto Peninsula!
Turned the school upside down.

849
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:04,181
His buddies were so proud of him.

850
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:08,090
The Fire Squad. Hand-drawn flames
on their school shoes.

851
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:11,757
The other kids worshipped them.

852
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:16,201
I never told anybody,
but I wanted to be a member.

853
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:20,771
Really? I had no idea.

854
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:29,480
But I understand. Tetsu taught me
some pretty cool stuff too.

855
01:11:30,086 --> 01:11:32,213
Like what exactly?

856
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:36,785
Just stuff. Real stuff, imaginary stuff,
truth, lies...

857
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:43,525
But I was really impressed the time he
told me when a day becomes the next.

858
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:47,028
Didn't know you were so close.

859
01:11:48,605 --> 01:11:52,041
We were probably in first
or second grade.

860
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:56,369
Y'know how it's always morning when
you wake up?

861
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:01,780
I always wondered when exactly today
turned into tomorrow.

862
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:05,012
Figured I'd find out if
I stayed up all night.

863
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:08,613
So I told him this during art class and
he just went...

864
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:13,657
You don't know?!
Tomorrow begins at 12 midnight!

865
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,265
That was a real shocker.

866
01:12:17,734 --> 01:12:21,033
I hadn't realized tomorrows had
to follow time.

867
01:12:21,604 --> 01:12:24,300
Maybe he knew 'cos he was a night owl.

868
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:29,173
But Kate, what'd you think triggered
the next day then?

869
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,172
Hmm.

870
01:12:36,419 --> 01:12:37,511
It's hopeless.

871
01:12:38,488 --> 01:12:39,512
You think?

872
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:45,558
I'm going home.

873
01:12:47,263 --> 01:12:48,230
Ok.

874
01:12:50,133 --> 01:12:51,259
Cheer up.

875
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,029
Keep warm.

876
01:14:31,267 --> 01:14:35,294
These tunnels look absolutely stunning
when you shoot them, y'know.

877
01:14:35,438 --> 01:14:39,306
A must for a coming-of-age pic. Yeah,
this could be my next project.

878
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,308
Enough of your ' upcoming' film projects.

879
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:45,873
Your next film? NEXT??

880
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,178
You've never shot a film in your life!

881
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:51,981
You just talk about it, like 700 times!

882
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:53,486
Aw, shut up...

883
01:14:53,623 --> 01:14:59,584
It's true. By now, I'm sure even Maki
thinks it's just all talk.

884
01:14:59,729 --> 01:15:03,927
No way. Maki and me, we connect,
it's true love.

885
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:10,002
She believes that some day, I'll make
this awesome film, kids'll flip out.

886
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:14,140
Kids, huh? Wonder where
your confidence comes from.

887
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:19,504
Y'know, Maki seemed a bit concerned.

888
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:21,378
About what?

889
01:15:21,584 --> 01:15:23,017
Not gonna tell you.

890
01:15:23,152 --> 01:15:25,586
Thanks. Now I'm worried!

891
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:29,256
Just don't make her unhappy, ok?

892
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:31,850
I'd feel guilty if that ever happened.

893
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:34,519
I'm telling you not to worry about us.

894
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,790
Focus on finding your man.

895
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,126
None of your business!

896
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:45,073
I'm sorry. It was my fault...

897
01:15:49,178 --> 01:15:50,372
I know...

898
01:15:56,419 --> 01:15:58,979
I told you I'm sorry...

899
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:03,892
Chiyo...

900
01:16:05,128 --> 01:16:06,117
Chiyo?

901
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:21,600
Chiyo!

902
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:24,602
Chiyo! I'm sorry I'm so late!

903
01:16:25,348 --> 01:16:30,752
I'm sorry. I had things I had to do and
I was already late when I left.

904
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,480
Then I missed a bus and 2 trains and...

905
01:16:33,623 --> 01:16:34,647
Liar!

906
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:40,253
I bet you had to answer one of those
stupid questionnaires at the station.

907
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:41,362
Am I right?

908
01:16:41,497 --> 01:16:41,895
Yes.

909
01:16:42,031 --> 01:16:43,965
Why do you listen to them?

910
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,192
I wasn't listening intentionally...

911
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:47,859
Did it cross your mind I was waiting?

912
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:52,302
I wanted to come as fast as I could,
but I couldn't... I'm sorry.

913
01:16:56,546 --> 01:16:57,877
I'm really sorry.

914
01:16:58,014 --> 01:17:02,917
A date? Good for you!
The joys of youth!

915
01:17:04,454 --> 01:17:06,081
Ah, the cold type!

916
01:17:06,222 --> 01:17:10,181
What about you boy, how about a tune?

917
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:14,126
No thank you. We're going to the zoo.

918
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:16,731
Ah. Good luck.

919
01:17:22,939 --> 01:17:26,136
Why did you have to smile and bow
at him, huh?

920
01:17:26,275 --> 01:17:30,143
He talked to you simply because
he was bored. BORED!

921
01:17:30,446 --> 01:17:33,609
I know, that's why I told him off...

922
01:17:36,953 --> 01:17:38,147
Chiyo, I'm sorry.

923
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:52,864
Let's go.

924
01:17:59,275 --> 01:18:00,742
Cops!

925
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:27,025
Welco...

926
01:18:27,169 --> 01:18:30,161
Police! Don't move!

927
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:33,842
You again, huh?

928
01:18:33,976 --> 01:18:37,309
You know gambling's illegal...

929
01:18:37,547 --> 01:18:39,515
Not my day...

930
01:19:39,609 --> 01:19:44,137
Think it's really alive?
Could be a teddy, y'know.

931
01:19:44,847 --> 01:19:47,907
Might as well be. No one'll notice.

932
01:19:50,853 --> 01:19:54,289
Look at that, it's moving.

933
01:19:56,626 --> 01:19:59,959
Oh yeah. He's eating the leaves.

934
01:20:01,864 --> 01:20:05,322
Yeah, he is, isn't he?

935
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:08,468
How cute.

936
01:20:13,342 --> 01:20:16,573
Bro, he moved again.

937
01:20:16,712 --> 01:20:20,113
They move so slowly.

938
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:27,779
Oh my God! That was hysterical!

939
01:20:32,695 --> 01:20:35,528
Hey, where are they?

940
01:20:36,232 --> 01:20:38,860
Maybe in the backroom?

941
01:20:39,435 --> 01:20:40,959
Could be meal time.

942
01:20:41,103 --> 01:20:44,504
But don't they eat eucalyptus?
Why not eat out front?

943
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:48,132
They don't come out, don't move...
Doesn't seem fair.

944
01:20:48,277 --> 01:20:51,974
They probably have their own reasons.

945
01:20:56,452 --> 01:21:00,582
There you go again,
worrying about others.

946
01:21:00,823 --> 01:21:04,782
Forget about the koalas' reasons.
Don't you want to see them?

947
01:21:05,428 --> 01:21:09,728
Yes, but not if they don't want
to come out.

948
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:13,596
Then I hope they decide to come outside,
for you.

949
01:21:13,736 --> 01:21:15,863
Who cares about koalas!

950
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:23,877
That's why people call you kind
and nice, Kawachi.

951
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:29,976
What are you talking about?

952
01:21:30,419 --> 01:21:35,083
You listen to people, go out for drinks.
Everyone says you're a nice guy.

953
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:35,622
Everyone?

954
01:21:35,758 --> 01:21:38,625
Everyone! Like girls in my class.

955
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:45,558
Feels weird having people talk about you
when you're not there. I don't like it.

956
01:21:45,701 --> 01:21:52,004
Why? You talk about other people when
you're with me. It's the same thing.

957
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:55,133
But every time I hear something like
that, it feels strange.

958
01:21:55,277 --> 01:21:58,769
Funny how you're so concerned about
what people think of you.

959
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:03,214
Isn't that why you listen to people ramble
on forever and answer questionnaires?

960
01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:04,216
I don't know.

961
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:07,483
See, you're not really thinking
about other people.

962
01:22:07,623 --> 01:22:12,686
You just can't imagine that they think
as much as you do.

963
01:22:13,362 --> 01:22:17,025
And the reason you're so concerned is
because you're so self-conscious!

964
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:22,870
Boy, don't argue with your girlfriend.

965
01:22:23,005 --> 01:22:24,131
I'm sorry.

966
01:22:25,141 --> 01:22:29,475
Yeah, don't fight. She's a pretty girl.

967
01:22:34,483 --> 01:22:37,611
Hey, let's go see the birdies.

968
01:22:54,503 --> 01:22:55,595
You know...

969
01:22:55,971 --> 01:23:00,169
It must be hard for them to be stuffed
in such a tiny place.

970
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:04,009
I'm sure they all have reasons
for their behavior.

971
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:12,116
Wonder why you have to worry about
everything and everyone like that.

972
01:23:16,392 --> 01:23:19,361
Not that I don't understand, mind you.

973
01:23:33,075 --> 01:23:36,340
Shit! A pigeon!

974
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:38,810
Go away!

975
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:45,346
Stinks!

976
01:23:50,593 --> 01:23:52,060
Shoo! Shoo!

977
01:23:53,062 --> 01:23:56,498
It moved! Moved! Moved!

978
01:24:09,011 --> 01:24:11,809
Dropped! Dropped!

979
01:24:12,014 --> 01:24:15,472
Noooo! Noooo!

980
01:24:15,951 --> 01:24:17,441
Stupid bird!!

981
01:24:25,628 --> 01:24:28,791
I heard polar bears are exceptionally
powerful and scary.

982
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:30,023
Yeah?

983
01:24:33,469 --> 01:24:37,030
They said it might be the strongest
carnivore, I saw it on TV.

984
01:24:37,907 --> 01:24:40,535
I wonder if that one's been here for long.

985
01:24:40,676 --> 01:24:41,472
Why?

986
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:45,507
I came here for drawing class when
I was in 3rd grade.

987
01:24:45,648 --> 01:24:48,640
Me too! We could've met then!

988
01:24:48,817 --> 01:24:50,842
I drew the polar bear.

989
01:24:50,986 --> 01:24:52,146
That one?

990
01:24:52,454 --> 01:24:58,415
That's what I want to know. It has to be
about 10 years ago, before we moved.

991
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,497
That bear was a nightmare to draw,
wouldn't look my way at all.

992
01:25:03,799 --> 01:25:05,266
And?

993
01:25:05,668 --> 01:25:09,365
I threw a tube of paint at him,
trying to get his attention.

994
01:25:09,505 --> 01:25:10,335
Successfully?

995
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:14,535
Yes. But then he ate the paint.

996
01:25:14,677 --> 01:25:15,575
What color?

997
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:16,506
Snow White.

998
01:25:16,645 --> 01:25:18,078
'Cos he was a polar bear?

999
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:21,913
Keep going.

1000
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:26,653
Well, the paint was oozing out
from his mouth.

1001
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:32,125
The white goo in stark contrast with
the black of his muzzle.

1002
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:34,425
It was a pretty scary sight.

1003
01:25:35,331 --> 01:25:38,391
Wonder if it's that one that
ate your paint.

1004
01:25:40,402 --> 01:25:42,131
I really hope so.

1005
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:47,234
I couldn't sleep for days worrying
if he'd die.

1006
01:25:51,513 --> 01:25:56,007
I'm sure he was ok, Kawachi.

1007
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:01,187
Just don't do it again, yeah?

1008
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:02,452
Yes.

1009
01:26:14,403 --> 01:26:17,600
Well, we've done the tour. What now?

1010
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:22,910
Hit Umeda? Or go to Shinsekai and
check out Tsutenkaku?

1011
01:26:23,479 --> 01:26:24,969
I've gotta go now.

1012
01:26:25,247 --> 01:26:26,839
Go where?!

1013
01:26:26,982 --> 01:26:30,383
Kyoto. I told you Masamichi's having a
housewarming party.

1014
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:33,977
You said you were free till the evening!

1015
01:26:34,123 --> 01:26:40,551
I told you I was leaving in the evening.
I've gotta go. Masamichi'll be angry.

1016
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:43,494
We said we'd go eat kushikatsu!

1017
01:26:43,632 --> 01:26:45,031
Not today...

1018
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:47,931
Well, that was my plan!

1019
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:54,066
Wish you'd told me you were splitting so
early. We could've met up in the morning.

1020
01:26:54,276 --> 01:26:56,210
But you never get up early.

1021
01:26:56,345 --> 01:26:58,575
If I knew, I would've.

1022
01:26:59,448 --> 01:27:06,320
I wish I hadn't come. And
our last date was ages ago.

1023
01:27:10,059 --> 01:27:14,291
Don't go.
Tell them something's come up.

1024
01:27:16,165 --> 01:27:17,632
Chiyo...

1025
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,795
Chiyo, wait up!

1026
01:27:20,936 --> 01:27:27,671
This was planned ages ago and I told him
that I'd help him prepare for it too.

1027
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:29,641
I'll be in trouble if I don't go.

1028
01:27:31,814 --> 01:27:34,874
So? Say you're sorry and get it over with.

1029
01:27:35,017 --> 01:27:35,847
Over with?

1030
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:39,442
Oh, so it's ok if I'm upset?
Is that it?

1031
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:41,613
Of course not! I never said that!

1032
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:46,659
Look, I know you care about people,
but learn to make up your mind.

1033
01:27:47,362 --> 01:27:51,628
You're going in spite of me anyway.
You just can't say "no", can you?

1034
01:27:52,034 --> 01:27:56,596
I'm sorry I wasn't clear enough,
but I really ought to get going...

1035
01:27:56,738 --> 01:28:00,003
So, go. Go if you want to.
I'm going home.

1036
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:02,968
Wait...

1037
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:07,507
Wait? Changed your mind?

1038
01:28:07,983 --> 01:28:13,478
No, that's not what I meant.
I... need to use the toilet.

1039
01:28:17,526 --> 01:28:19,858
My stomach hurts.

1040
01:28:19,995 --> 01:28:24,694
Not again! You always get that stupid
stomachache when you're in trouble.

1041
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:28,667
And we never talk things through 'cos
you have to run to the toilet.

1042
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:35,710
I'm sorry. It's all my fault. So please
wait for me until I come back.

1043
01:28:35,844 --> 01:28:38,404
I wish you'd do something about that.

1044
01:28:38,547 --> 01:28:39,639
It won't happen again.

1045
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:40,577
Whatever. I'm leaving.

1046
01:28:40,716 --> 01:28:43,844
Wait! Please wait for me. Please?

1047
01:28:44,386 --> 01:28:46,820
I'll be back in a flash!

1048
01:28:52,127 --> 01:28:53,025
Idiot.

1049
01:29:16,451 --> 01:29:17,349
Kawachi.

1050
01:29:19,555 --> 01:29:20,920
Sorry about earlier.

1051
01:29:26,895 --> 01:29:28,829
Wanna eat some crab?

1052
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:38,337
Kawachi...

1053
01:29:40,475 --> 01:29:47,074
Good morning to drivers out there.
The sun is about to rise.

1054
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:54,911
The temperature is lower than average.
Seems like spring is a long way off.

1055
01:29:55,791 --> 01:30:02,162
Did you hear about the whale that was
found stranded on Ona Beach?

1056
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:06,531
14 meters in length.

1057
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:14,240
One of the largest creatures on earth,
but a mammal just like us. Amazing.

1058
01:30:15,811 --> 01:30:22,614
This next song goes to the whale on
the beach, in hopes for a swift rescue.

1059
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:56,950
Hey Maki, you're awake.

1060
01:30:57,052 --> 01:30:57,916
Yes.

1061
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,644
You were asleep forever.

1062
01:31:02,291 --> 01:31:07,024
Hey, Kate! Change it!
I don't like meat buns!

1063
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:24,977
Good evening.

1064
01:31:26,548 --> 01:31:27,845
Good morning.

1065
01:31:35,424 --> 01:31:39,190
Oh, it is already morning.

1066
01:31:42,631 --> 01:31:45,099
What took you so long, man?

1067
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:48,658
How far did you go anyway?

1068
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:54,168
What happened?

1069
01:31:54,609 --> 01:31:55,837
Ouch!

1070
01:31:56,945 --> 01:31:58,276
Minor accident.

1071
01:31:59,181 --> 01:32:01,012
Hey, where's Kawachi?

1072
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:03,381
Went to see his girlfriend.

1073
01:32:04,119 --> 01:32:05,347
His girlfriend?

1074
01:32:05,754 --> 01:32:07,517
Lucky bastard.

1075
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:14,256
Whatever. Me, I prefer crab.

1076
01:32:14,396 --> 01:32:17,797
Crab it is! Let's go! C'mon, Masamichi.

1077
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:40,848
So where was your classroom?

1078
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:47,186
Next to the clock on the 2nd floor
during 10th grade.

1079
01:32:48,263 --> 01:32:49,161
Ah.

1080
01:32:50,766 --> 01:32:52,256
11th grade?

1081
01:32:52,734 --> 01:32:53,758
The one above it.

1082
01:32:54,503 --> 01:32:55,993
And during 12th grade?

1083
01:32:56,138 --> 01:32:57,105
The one above it.

1084
01:32:58,273 --> 01:32:59,535
Hmm.

1085
01:33:01,276 --> 01:33:03,437
Extracurricular activities?

1086
01:33:04,179 --> 01:33:05,806
None whatsoever.

1087
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:07,570
Yeah?

1088
01:33:08,417 --> 01:33:10,180
Not even film society?

1089
01:33:10,318 --> 01:33:14,277
We didn't have a film club. Besides...

1090
01:33:14,423 --> 01:33:19,053
I wouldn't have wanted to make films
in that kind of environment anyway.

1091
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:23,291
Actually, I wanted to do something
more physical.

1092
01:33:23,432 --> 01:33:29,894
Football looked neat, rugby, cool,
but I sorta missed the chance to join.

1093
01:33:30,172 --> 01:33:32,163
Too busy just checking them out.

1094
01:33:34,209 --> 01:33:35,198
I see.

1095
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:49,720
Do you know why I wanted you to
bring me here?

1096
01:33:50,425 --> 01:33:51,392
No, why?

1097
01:33:53,862 --> 01:33:59,562
I want to know everything about you.

1098
01:34:04,506 --> 01:34:10,445
I want to be the one who knows it all.
Absolutely everything there is to know.

1099
01:34:13,548 --> 01:34:15,641
Absolutely everything...

1100
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:24,081
Aren't you going to make a film?

1101
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:26,320
You should, you know.

1102
01:34:26,495 --> 01:34:28,019
I will, yes.

1103
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:35,893
You're pretty quick picking up girls but
when it comes to film? Another story.

1104
01:34:37,405 --> 01:34:44,834
The thing is, somehow the time and
material don't mesh.

1105
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:50,645
It always seems like there are
better ideas for a better film.

1106
01:34:52,754 --> 01:34:55,120
I can see you thinking that.

1107
01:34:55,624 --> 01:34:57,615
What does that mean?

1108
01:35:00,829 --> 01:35:06,267
I think you should use your instinct
about the material, you know.

1109
01:35:07,068 --> 01:35:09,662
The whale, for instance.

1110
01:35:09,804 --> 01:35:11,465
What whale?

1111
01:35:11,907 --> 01:35:15,900
They found a stranded whale
on Ona Beach. You didn't know?

1112
01:35:16,044 --> 01:35:17,511
No.

1113
01:35:18,246 --> 01:35:22,512
A whale movie. You can use miniatures.

1114
01:35:22,884 --> 01:35:26,684
Or maybe CG. It could work.

1115
01:35:27,789 --> 01:35:31,190
Think so? Won't it cost a lot?

1116
01:35:31,426 --> 01:35:35,157
It'll be fine. And it sounds fun.

1117
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:38,597
A stranded whale, huh.

1118
01:35:40,302 --> 01:35:44,739
Well, it's a possibility.
It does sound interesting.

1119
01:35:44,873 --> 01:35:49,901
See? And I know you'll make a great
film whatever the material.

1120
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:53,646
Well, aren't you sweet.

1121
01:35:53,949 --> 01:35:56,315
The cutest girl in the whole world.

1122
01:35:56,585 --> 01:36:00,214
...You're at it again.

1123
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:05,818
Oh, hey! Let's go see the whale!

1124
01:36:06,027 --> 01:36:07,289
The stranded one?

1125
01:36:07,562 --> 01:36:10,998
Yeah, it would be like, like...

1126
01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:11,960
What?

1127
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:13,067
Scouting locations!!

1128
01:36:13,368 --> 01:36:14,665
Scouting locations?

1129
01:36:14,803 --> 01:36:15,861
Let's do it!

1130
01:36:17,539 --> 01:36:21,100
Well, I wouldn't call it scouting,
but what the heck.

1131
01:36:21,242 --> 01:36:22,732
That's the spirit!

1132
01:36:37,859 --> 01:36:39,053
I'm cold!

1133
01:36:40,195 --> 01:36:41,685
Hey, you're awake.

1134
01:36:41,863 --> 01:36:47,460
For a while now.
Figured I shouldn't intrude.

1135
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:50,668
We're going to see the whale?

1136
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:51,464
Yep.

1137
01:36:53,775 --> 01:36:57,973
It's already tomorrow.

1138
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:01,873
Nope. It's already today.

1139
01:37:06,554 --> 01:37:08,351
Well, shall we?

1140
01:37:31,279 --> 01:37:32,268
Mr. Matsumoto...

1141
01:37:37,719 --> 01:37:38,708
What is it?

1142
01:37:41,056 --> 01:37:44,389
Thank you for doing all this...

1143
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:48,385
for a moron like me.

1144
01:37:50,832 --> 01:37:54,199
Hey, say no more, Kawasaki.

1145
01:37:56,337 --> 01:37:57,668
We got the green light!!

1146
01:37:57,806 --> 01:38:00,206
Yes! Finally!

1147
01:38:02,343 --> 01:38:04,402
Let's cut the pipes!!

1148
01:38:04,546 --> 01:38:05,740
Yeah!

1149
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:11,314
Kawasaki, it won't be long!

1150
01:38:13,955 --> 01:38:15,013
Yes!

1151
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:39,116
By the way, do we have a camera?

1152
01:41:39,327 --> 01:41:40,555
Not me.

1153
01:41:43,564 --> 01:41:45,532
Me neither.

1154
01:41:46,501 --> 01:41:47,593
Shit...

1155
01:41:56,978 --> 01:42:00,812
What happened today will stay
in our hearts.

1156
01:42:02,517 --> 01:42:04,109
Thank you so much.

1157
01:42:05,186 --> 01:42:06,778
Good luck!

1158
01:42:54,869 --> 01:42:58,100
Hey, isn't that Masamichi
and Nishiyama?

1159
01:43:00,908 --> 01:43:03,001
Guess they came to see it too.

1160
01:43:03,144 --> 01:43:04,133
Hey!

1161
01:43:06,214 --> 01:43:07,806
You guys came too?

1162
01:43:07,949 --> 01:43:08,813
Yeah.

1163
01:43:09,884 --> 01:43:12,853
Where's Kawachi?

1164
01:43:13,087 --> 01:43:14,281
He left.

1165
01:43:15,623 --> 01:43:19,855
Went to see his girl.
With a nice, fresh hair cut.

1166
01:43:20,962 --> 01:43:21,792
His GIRL.

1167
01:43:21,896 --> 01:43:22,726
The whale?

1168
01:43:22,864 --> 01:43:23,694
Yeah.

1169
01:43:23,831 --> 01:43:25,765
Same here.

1170
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:27,129
Where is it?

1171
01:43:27,268 --> 01:43:28,257
Um...

1172
01:43:34,475 --> 01:43:37,774
They said it was this beach,
but no one's here.

1173
01:43:38,546 --> 01:43:39,706
Yeah.

1174
01:43:42,817 --> 01:43:43,977
You did it on purpose.

1175
01:43:45,019 --> 01:43:48,045
Do what? It's cool, isn't it?

1176
01:43:48,189 --> 01:43:49,383
It's cosmic.

1177
01:43:49,524 --> 01:43:51,424
You look better with short hair.

1178
01:44:06,808 --> 01:44:09,299
I'd love to have seen the whale.

1179
01:44:09,977 --> 01:44:11,239
Yeah.

1180
01:44:12,647 --> 01:44:14,638
Wonder if it died.

1181
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:17,106
Nah, it's alive.

1182
01:44:18,686 --> 01:44:20,244
I hope so.

1183
01:44:21,456 --> 01:44:23,822
Maybe someone ate it.

1184
01:44:24,325 --> 01:44:25,587
No way!

1185
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:26,849
Eaten!

1186
01:44:27,361 --> 01:44:28,521
Not!

1187
01:44:34,936 --> 01:44:37,928
So, no scouting for you, I guess.

1188
01:44:39,807 --> 01:44:41,798
Maybe Willy's not for me.

1189
01:44:42,343 --> 01:44:45,312
I thought this was it.

1190
01:44:46,581 --> 01:44:48,412
I'll find something else.

1191
01:44:50,218 --> 01:44:51,048
Yes.

1192
01:45:33,027 --> 01:45:38,761
Whale Stranded on Ona Beach

1193
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:48,672
I knew you'd come.

1194
01:45:54,649 --> 01:45:55,707
...Morning.

1195
01:45:57,818 --> 01:45:58,876
...Morning.

1196
01:46:12,934 --> 01:46:14,458
You cut your hair.

1197
01:46:15,536 --> 01:46:16,366
Yes.

1198
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:20,300
Mistake!

1199
