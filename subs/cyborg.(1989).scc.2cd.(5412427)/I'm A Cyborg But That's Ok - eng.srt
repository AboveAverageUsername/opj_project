- Yeah, head meat.

What could your parents

After all, parents are always
the most important factor.

it's especially the father.

They say 10 years ago,
a patient disappeared.

107
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:02,303
His name was Oh Dong-soo and
he was thin and pale like rice paper.

108
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:05,281
And he was plagued
by non-stop hiccups.

109
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:09,176
The staff, the military and police,
they searched everywhere for him

110
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,088
They even had the hounds up
in the mountains.

111
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,093
Said he was a dangerous psychopath.

was making hiccupping sounds

114
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:36,209

curled up in here, dead.

A police officer?
Who is he kidding?

130
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,589
He's just a uniform freak.

131
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,591
He put on a schoolgirl uniform,
killed his wife...

132
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,292
And burned his house down.

133
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,300
Let's change the subject.

134
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,706
That guy in the mask, they say
he used to be really handsome.

135
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:43,008
But after he was gang raped
in the army, he went mad.

136
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:52,187
He blamed his handsome face and
burned it with cigarette butts.

137
00:09:53,326 --> 00:10:01,290
Then he sewed up his own anus.

138
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,704
That man over there.

139
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,305
He's a farmer from Kyung-san.

140
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,005
A nice, quiet bachelor all his life,

141
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,672
good to everyone in the village.

142
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:22,880
But he fell in love with a calf
that he delivered himself.

143
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,889
Its name was Jenny, I think.

144
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,188
He brought it into his room to live

145
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:34,288
It couldn't talk, didn't have hands,
but he would wash its face.

146
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,594
And listened to the radio with it,
and so on.

147
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:40,604
The town folk thought he was a freak
and had him put in here.

148
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:47,301
But he really only loved
Jenny platonically.

149
00:10:58,624 --> 00:10:59,784
I'm depressed.

150
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,898
Who's this chick?

151
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,002
Huh?

152
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,504
I don't know.

153
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:29,686
Sul-mi! You're not supposed to
take a patient around like this.

154
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,891
Not my fault.
Someone left her with me.

155
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,688
Don't be that way with me, doctor!

156
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:43,898
You know I'm sick! You shouldn't
embarrass me like this.

157
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:54,204
Did she tell you many stories,
Young-goon?

158
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,780
The things she tells you...

159
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,077
That's right! They're all lies!

160
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,090
Yes, they're all lies.
It's called mythomania.

161
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,194
She has an illness that makes her
tell tall tales.

162
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:13,594
She loses all her memory each time
she gets shock therapy

163
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,794
So she makes up stories to
take the place of her memories.

164
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,289
What's wrong?

165
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,295
She won't talk.

166
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,991
Psychotic depression?

167
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:53,094
Her grandmother was schizophrenic.
Thought she was a mouse.

168
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,505
Was she afraid of her mother-in-law?

169
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:57,904
How'd you know that?

170
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,402
I once saw...

171
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,682
Two patients who thought
they were mice.

172
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,879
They both said they were afraid
of their mothers-in-law.

173
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,086
I don't know where to start with her.

174
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,692
<i>She won't stir a finger.</i>

175
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,692
<i>Her eyes are out of focus.</i>

176
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,300
Hey kids!

177
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:59,496
I'm here. You fluorescent lights.

178
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,406
No use pretending
you don't understand me.

179
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,214
Lights here aren't very friendly,
are they?

180
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:17,085
No matter how tired you are,
it's bad manners not to say hello.

181
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,892
How are you,
after working all day?

182
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,803
Really?

183
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,402
Then...

184
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,511
Perhaps some adlay tea, please?

185
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,706
Thank you kindly.

186
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:31,494
Maybe the lights in the wards
will be friendlier.

187
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,188
Since they rest at night.

188
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,896
So you knew from the beginning
that you're a light?

189
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,607
I only found out later in life
that I'm a cyborg.

190
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:50,281
<i>The white 'uns came and took</i>
<i>my granny away in an ambulance.</i>

191
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,777
<i>You know the white 'uns!</i>

192
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,177
<i>They're all over the place here.</i>

193
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:59,087
<i>They wear white-doctors, nurses...</i>

194
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,486
Granny!

195
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,685
<i>Right, and orderlies!</i>

196
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,292
- <i>She took the radish.</i>
- Granny!

197
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,195
<i>But left her dentures.</i>
<i>So I ran after her with them.</i>

198
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:13,098
<i>Granny needs them to eat radish.</i>
<i>She's a mouse, you know.</i>

199
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,905
<i>Just then, a bike came up</i>
<i>and took me.</i>

200
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:23,476
<i>But a bike can't beat an ambulance.</i>

201
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,674
<i>Even a kid in knickers knows that.</i>

202
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:30,477
<i>So I bawled and you know</i>
<i>what the bike said?</i>

203
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,386
'A cyborg can beat anything.'

204
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,392
'How come you don't know that
when you're a cyborg yourself?'

205
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,894
So I had to pretend
I had always known.

206
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:46,698
But the problem was I couldn't
catch up to the ambulance for real.

207
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,109
So, ask me what I said
to the bike then.

208
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:57,081
'Confounded fool,
I'm all out of battery, you moron.'

209
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,076
So I endeavored to recharge
by listening

210
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,881
to educational broadcasts
at the factory.

211
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,788
I'm only fully recharged
when it lights up to here.

212
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,191
But look, I'm almost on empty.

213
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:19,702
I did as the broadcast told me,
and the ambulance brought me here.

214
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,199
I'm a machine, but...

215
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:28,609
I didn't come with an instruction
manual or a label on me anywhere.

216
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,378
I still don't know what my purpose is.

217
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,287
What was I made for?

218
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,289
You didn't eat your lunch, did you?

219
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:53,701
You won't be able to starve
yourself to death that way.

220
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,804
The cafeteria ladies keep tabs
on everything you eat.

221
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:05,074
A girl like you once tried
to starve herself to death.

222
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,276
She was so enthusiastic.

223
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:14,582
But hospitals have
force-feeding machines.

224
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:22,289
Doctors and professors meet
to confer on how to feed you...

225
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:31,000
It's embarrassing to have them force
food up your nose in front of people.

226
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:36,978
So that girl is still eating,
and alive and kicking.

227
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,577
Sad, isn't it?

228
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,380
So I was thinking...

229
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,882
Want me to help you?

230
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:42,011
Broadcast, broadcast!

231
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,980
Broadcast!

232
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:03,094
Listen. There are some
really good messages.

233
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,914
<i>Time for meditation.</i>

234
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:23,284
<i>Get up and listen to the hum of</i>
<i>the fridge in the middle of night</i>

235
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,982
<i>On a cold winter morning.</i>

236
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:32,488
<i>Feel the sound of the boiler</i>
<i>that has been running all night</i>

237
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:40,196
<i>They move us to tears because</i>
<i>they have a purpose of existence.</i>

238
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:48,612
<i>Think of the lighthouse's holy</i>
<i>and beautiful heart of love.</i>

239
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,278
<i>To be continued.</i>

240
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:05,293
If only I had just one
purpose of existence, too.

241
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:18,300
Il-soon, please, your mask!

242
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:25,173
Will the pretty Gop-dahn
please explain?

243
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,980
Our hospital has stabilizing rooms...

244
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:34,681
for those who cause discomfort
to others or create safety issues.

245
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:38,193
And when it is deemed
a necessary treatment...

246
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,988
- With the patient's consent.
- What consent?

247
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,897
You told me to stay in
the stabilizing

248
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,504
room until I gave my consent!

249
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,897
I told you before that if you hit
others for no reason like that...

250
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,807
You have to go in the stabilizing room.

251
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,606
But Il-soon is a thief!

252
00:21:56,348 --> 00:22:01,684
A detestable and shameless psycho,
anti-social and schizophrenic!

253
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,788
Isn't that an attack
on his character?

254
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,482
It's not an attack!
It's defense!

255
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,991
He stole something
very important to me!

256
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:15,896
Alright, what did Il-soon steal
from you, Dae-pyong?

257
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,901
They all point to me
if anything goes missing.

258
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:25,499
For the past 3 days, I can't
even receive a simple serve.

259
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:30,479
While Park Il-soon won 5 games
just yesterday!

260
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:37,077
With the unique service technique
that I developed 12 years ago!

261
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:43,283
There's no point not stealing.
They all think I did it anyway.

262
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,396
Come on, that's not true.

263
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,899
...12 years ago!

264
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,309
I see, you lost your ping-pong game.

265
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,807
It was about a month ago.

266
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:08,786
I suddenly lost my appetite
and couldn't eat.

267
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,386
Think of what it did to my skin!

268
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:17,984
Il-soon came and ate all my food.

269
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,496
He's the one who stole the elastic
band around my waist

270
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:21,599
for a whole week.

271
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,394
The elastic band
for your pajamas?

272
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:27,699
No, this skin colored elastic band
I was born with around my waist!

273
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,204
Look at this.
It's all stretched out!

274
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,901
Does he mean he was born
wearing pajamas?

275
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:38,380
Then is Il-soon the one who stole
my memory, too?

276
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,382
You bastard!

277
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,785
You thief!

278
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,392
- Give me back my ping-pong!
- You stretched my band!

279
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,189
Mr. Pajamas, please!

280
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:04,903
I told you your mother
didn't leave because of you.

281
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,778
Yeah, right!

282
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,086
Then how come she never
called but once?

283
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,485
To tell me not to forget to
brush my teeth before bed!

284
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,496
Fine! I'll admit it!

285
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,089
Last night, I stole Thursday.

286
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:30,492
Whose Thursday?

287
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:41,503
How can a person steal Thursday?

288
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,898
Look, Thursday's panties are missing.

289
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:13,206
Monday's are right here, where else?

290
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,179
I had no idea.

291
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,784
He's really good.

292
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,983
This is a fortuitous crossing of
paths, for sure.

293
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:27,585
I must find out more about this thief.

294
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:33,687
I have this thing
I want someone

295
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:37,598
to steal away from me.

296
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,203
I don't know how I'll ever thank you.

297
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,580
So sorry for being so slow!

298
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,299
Hello, everyone!
How are you?

299
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,901
- Have you had lunch?
- Sure.

300
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,009
Yeah, I have.

301
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:25,474
Have you had lunch?

302
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,783
Don't skip the meal.

303
00:26:58,516 --> 00:26:59,676
Psycho.

304
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,390
I'm not a psy-cho.

305
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,087
I'm a cy-borg.

306
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,295
Ah, I let slip.

307
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,097
I promised Mom I wouldn't.

308
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:39,388
Mom, I think I'm a cyborg.

309
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,796
What's that?

310
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:55,200
I think it's kind of like a robot?

311
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,672
Have you missed a period?
Because you're a cybor?

312
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,878
Anything you want to eat?
Like radishes?

313
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:29,398
Then it's okay.
Now go get some sleep.

314
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,402
It's okay if you're a cybor.

315
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,480
It won't interfere with
the way you live.

316
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,584
Just don't let anybody know.

317
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,990
Who would come to eat at a shop
where the daughter's a cybor?

318
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:53,691
<i>Cyborg, are you thinking of</i>
<i>your Granny?</i>

319
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,500
I certainly am.

320
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:01,196
<i>You aren't feeling sad, are you?</i>

321
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,601
No, why of course not!

322
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:09,404
<i>She's wondering about you, too...</i>

323
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,582
<i>And why you haven't killed</i>
<i>the white 'uns yet.</i>

324
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:18,178
<i>She wonders why you don't bag</i>
<i>the white 'uns that dragged her away.</i>

325
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:21,292
<i>And bring her the dentures.</i>

326
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,288
But I...

327
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,795
I don't have enough power.

328
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:35,703
This charging method seems to
have its limitations.

329
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:39,210
<i>I hope it's not</i>
<i>because of sympathy.</i>

330
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:44,179
<i>You know that sympathy is</i>
<i>the worst of the 7 Deadly Sins.</i>

331
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,779
No, really...

332
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,979
It's not because of sympathy.

333
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:55,986
<i>For your reference,</i>
<i>the other 6 are as follows.</i>

334
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,393
<i>Being sad.</i>

335
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,797
<i>Restlessness.</i>

336
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,699
<i>Hesitating about anything.</i>

337
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,602
<i>Useless daydreaming.</i>

338
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,378
<i>Feeling guilty.</i>

339
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,182
<i>Thankfulness.</i>

340
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:27,280
<i>The above was in</i>
<i>the order of evilness.</i>

341
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,088
Yes

342
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:37,397
<i>Useless daydreaming about whether</i>
<i>the white 'uns have grannies, too...</i>

343
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:44,703
<i>Sympathy for their grannies</i>
<i>if the white 'uns died...</i>

344
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:50,171
<i>And hesitating about killing them.</i>
<i>You must forego these sins.</i>

345
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:04,988
<i>Floriculture Therapy</i>

346
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,695
Take your ping-pong back.

347
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:10,699
It makes my butt itchy
every time I play.

348
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:15,605
The right cheek.

349
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,004
Transfer!

350
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:51,798
- Go Dae-pyong!
- Go, doc!

351
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,070
<i>He is very polite.</i>

352
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:00,177
<i>He's so humble he can't</i>
<i>even walk forwards.</i>

353
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,180
<i>Court etiquette, he says.</i>

354
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:12,696
<i>He thinks it's his fault</i>
<i>when anything goes wrong.</i>

355
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,500
Are you there?

356
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,600
- Hello?
- What is it?!

357
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:23,798
Just wondering if it was
my fault you lost?

358
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,914
<i>He happened to drive past</i>
<i>the scene of an accident...</i>

359
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:32,278
<i>And he was convinced</i>
<i>it was his fault.</i>

360
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,587
<i>He followed the victims around</i>
<i>apologizing.</i>

361
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:40,691
<i>When they couldn't stand it</i>
<i>any longer...</i>

362
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,588
<i>They reported him and</i>
<i>he was brought to this hospital.</i>

363
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,695
I said no!

364
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,799
It wasn't your fault, Duk-chun.

365
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:53,597
It's my ping-pong!
It's too itchy to play!

366
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,301
<i>Duk-chun is an expert at saying</i>
<i>redundant things.</i>

367
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:05,375
Isn't ping-pong about
giving and receiving?

368
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,782
I don't think so!

369
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:14,790
Must one always receive
after giving?

370
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:20,790
Can't there be ping-pong
where we only give?

371
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:32,102
So it was my fault.

372
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:45,483
A cat is, above all,
a furry animal.

373
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:54,294
Actually, my wife is furry, too.

374
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:03,000
<i>Isn't it obvious I'd become impotent</i>

375
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,109
<i>with a furry wife?</i>

376
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:09,006
<i>I'll hear from the judiciary soon.</i>

377
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,377
<i>I filed a suit against her.</i>

378
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:16,676
<i>She hid that she's a furry monster</i>
<i>when we got married.</i>

379
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:23,886
<i>Making a police officer impotent is</i>
<i>an obstruction of his duties.</i>

380
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,602
Alright, transfer!

381
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,176
Hello, there!

382
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,287
How are you all doing?

383
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,980
Have you had lunch?

384
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,284
Hello!

385
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,586
How are you? Hello!

386
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:57,694
Have you had lunch?

387
00:34:58,729 --> 00:34:59,889
Oh my god.

388
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:01,290
I'm so sorry.

389
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,400
Are you okay?

390
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:04,899
I'm so sorry.

391
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,095
- How can I tell you how sorry I am?
- I'm so tired!

392
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,604
I'm sorry I made you tired.

393
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,607
Why do I always tire people out
like this? I'm sorry.

394
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:17,480
I had a dream...

395
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:24,482
To make amends to everyone
I've ever troubled.

396
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:33,388
People should make amends
whenever they've caused trouble.

397
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,500
But now...

398
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,601
I've had all my politeness stolen.

399
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,501
Now how am I supposed to apologize?

400
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:50,976
Do you remember
where you lost it?

401
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:54,983
You people don't know what
it's like to have troubled others!

402
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,780
You bitch!

403
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,500
Please steal it.

404
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,603
My sympathy.

405
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:20,808
Like Thursday.

406
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,412
Sympathy?

407
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:24,373
What's that?

408
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,577
The feeling that stops me
from killing those I should.

409
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,083
I keep thinking...

410
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,893
What if I killed the white 'uns...

411
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:41,890
And they have grannies, too?
The poor grannies...

412
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:45,595
Look, miss.

413
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,198
When you speak to a person,

414
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,705
You have to speak so that
the person can understand.

415
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,308
Well, sympathy is...

416
00:36:56,247 --> 00:37:00,877
My mom, aunt and uncle
shouldn't have acted that way!

417
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,480
How could they have
so little sympathy?

418
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,783
No one's a mouse because
they want to be a mouse.

419
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,482
Don't even talk about moms!

420
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:11,187
I'm sorry.

421
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:18,293
And if you keep asking me
to steal something...

422
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,200
That's not stealing. It's just
taking what you're giving.

423
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,898
Then what should I do?

424
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,305
Well, when I...

425
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:32,275
When I set out to steal
something from someone...

426
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,385
I have to watch that person
stealthily for a few days.

427
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,587
Can you do that?

428
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:39,983
No problem.

429
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:44,584
I have to watch them stealthily
and find something I want to steal

430
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:49,593
Then I get the stealthy
desire to steal.

431
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,093
Are you really up to this?

432
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:55,600
You can trust me.

433
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,506
Once I have the stealthy
desire to steal...

434
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,603
It can only be completed if I steal
without the person's consent.

435
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,577
They have to hate
my stealing from them.

436
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,579
Can you do that for me?

437
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,781
promise to hate it.
I beg of you to do it.

438
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:15,686
<i>Since I walk backwards</i>
<i>she can't follow me...</i>

439
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:18,090
<i>So she spends her time</i>
<i>talking to machines</i>

440
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:19,389
<i>with those dentures in.</i>

441
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,391
<i>She holds her hand out to doctors</i>
<i>and nurses to shake hands...</i>

442
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:27,994
<i>And she wants to very much</i>
<i>but then suddenly pulls away.</i>

443
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,670
<i>She loathes it so much</i>
<i>her hands tremble.</i>

444
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,775
<i>Why does she hold out her hand if</i>
<i>she dislikes shaking hands so much?</i>

445
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,585
<i>She hasn't done much,</i>
<i>why is she so exhausted?</i>

446
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,897
<i>Because she doesn't eat, no wonder.</i>

447
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:42,405
Coffee.

448
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,178
Black.

449
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:59,589
Are you over your flickering now?

450
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,875
Lights, vending machine,
public phone, hiccup clock!

451
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:22,076
Have you seen my granny's dentures?

452
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:26,679
You can't understand me
without the dentures, can you?

453
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,494
Where are those dentures?

454
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:41,093
<i>Young-goon doesn't eat her food.</i>

455
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,301
<i>Gop-dahn eats it.</i>

456
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,607
<i>Young-goon doesn't eat her food.</i>
<i>P.S. Gop-dahn eats it.</i>

457
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,987
For today's gathering,
we're talking about

458
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,886
our most painful partings.

459
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:04,586
How about you Duk-chun?

460
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:05,896
Ready...

461
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,295
<i>My most painful parting was?</i>

462
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:10,491
<i>My most painful parting was?</i>

463
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:14,593
<i>My most painful parting was?</i>

464
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:15,898
Mother...

465
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:19,502
fucker!

466
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,286
How about me, doctor?

467
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,680
Sure! Ready?

468
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,384
<i>My most painful parting was?</i>

469
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,998
When I was 15 and my mom left home...

470
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:49,297
She took the entire family set
of electrical toothbrushes...

471
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,698
And left for good.

472
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:55,706
After that, I became a thief.

473
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,699
You damned thief!

474
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,786
Take your politeness back, mister.

475
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:45,486
Your walking backwards and
saying redundant things, all of it.

476
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:50,489
But why? I don't want to.

477
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,797
People can't follow me from behind!

478
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:56,697
Here. Transfer!

479
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,992
<i>This news just in.</i>

480
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:27,300
She was moved to a nearby hospital
but never woke from her coma

481
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,074
Granny is... critical?

482
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:44,180
In critical condition...

483
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:45,980
The white 'uns...

484
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:49,584
Granny... earring...

485
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,600
Oh... eating... radish...

486
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:58,993
They don't like it.

487
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:01,197
So...

488
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:05,497
They won't let me give
her the dentures.

489
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:10,973
My Granny... loves...

490
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,476
radish... so much...

491
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,185
I must... kill them... all.

492
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:20,683
Confounded bastards...

493
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,990
Please...

494
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,594
Steal...

495
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:32,595
My sympathy!

496
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,211
Stop crying!

497
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,175
Do you hate it?

498
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:49,278
No?

499
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:56,088
I told you that you must hate it!

500
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,802
I hate it! I hate it! I hate it!

501
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,699
I truly hate it!

502
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,410
I'm taking away your sympathy.

503
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,376
Alright, transfer!

504
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:31,688
When I count to five and
snap my fingers, open your eyes.

505
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:38,397
One, two, three, four.

506
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:39,695
Five.

507
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,407
<i>No sympathy.</i>

508
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:47,110
Young-goon!

509
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:09,392
Young-goon?

510
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:43,693
My battery...

511
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,597
Battery is...

512
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:50,701
Empty.

513
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,001
Young-goon!

514
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:57,978
Young-goon?

515
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:00,376
Young-goon?

516
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,493
Wang Gop-dahn!

517
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,495
Gop-dahn!

518
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,605
Tell me the truth

519
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:31,574
Did you really eat
Young-goon's food?

520
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:37,075
<i>Beautiful Berne.</i>

521
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:41,587
<i>Where the clear stream flows.</i>

522
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:46,887
How much more will
I have to practice...

523
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,694
to get into the Edelweiss
Boys' and Girls' Choir?

524
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,699
In my case, I have an elastic band
around my waist

525
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,501
I always feel reassured
even in strange places.

526
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,307
Stop, or our eyes will meet
and it will be scandalous.

527
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:11,485
<i>Red alpine roses.</i>
<i>Blooming in the dew.</i>

528
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:14,284
When my life reaches its end.

529
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:16,790
The elastic band will be
stretched to its limit

530
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:21,889
I've already been practicing for
31 years since I failed the audition.

531
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,897
Snap! And I'll just go back...

532
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,101
To where I started off originally.

533
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:31,501
<i>Das Obuh-lan-ya Obuh-lan.</i>

534
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:35,203
<i>The beautiful mountains of Berne.</i>

535
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:42,274
<i>Das Obuh-lan-ya Obuh-lan,</i>
<i>Oh, my love Berne...</i>

536
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,084
Do you think humans can
go against gravity?

537
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:48,983
Do you think...

538
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,088
humans can go...

539
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:53,997
against gravity?

540
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,108
I succeeded in my experiment!

541
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,382
Sleep flying!

542
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:23,088
Peppermint sherbet and
persimmon socks

543
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:28,494
They create static electrical tension.

544
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:32,197
And that makes the body float.

545
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,105
Like superconducting
magnetically levitated trains.

546
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:39,003
Watch. Here I go.

547
00:49:57,027 --> 00:50:01,487
Should avoid eating things like
chicken right before flying.

548
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:06,496
<i>Young-goon's always lying down</i>
<i>so I can't see her much these days</i>

549
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:09,696
<i>Can you see me, Sul-mi?</i>

550
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:13,205
Partially, but...

551
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,973
Why don't you take it off?

552
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:28,788
What if I do and I'm invisible?

553
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:32,288
<i>My mom and dad used to act like</i>
<i>I wasn't there,</i>

554
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,090
<i>even when I was.</i>

555
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,392
<i>That's why I'm good at stealing.</i>

556
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,000
<i>Because people can't see</i>
<i>me sometimes.</i>

557
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:40,700
<i>From the time I was 20,</i>
<i>I learned electrical wiring.</i>

558
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:43,897
<i>I made good money,</i>
<i>but I got caught stealing a motorcycle.</i>

559
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:48,808
<i>When I was being tried, the judge</i>
<i>said something only I could hear</i>

560
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:56,181
Defendant Park Il-soon
will eventually vanish into a dot.

561
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:00,287
You shithead!

562
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:07,591
Oh dear!

563
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:12,095
<i>I did all kinds of things in jail</i>

564
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,100
<i>Because I felt like I was vanishing.</i>

565
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:17,003
<i>I stole other people's</i>
<i>clothes to wear</i>

566
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,004
<i>And I brushed my teeth diligently.</i>

567
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:27,274
<i>Once your teeth start to go,</i>
<i>there's no turning back.</i>

568
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,679
That's true.

569
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,388
<i>I had a psych evaluation and...</i>

570
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:35,082
<i>They said I'm schizophrenic</i>
<i>and anti-social.</i>

571
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,484
Anti-social?

572
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:41,188
<i>Like stealing and fighting</i>
<i>for no reason.</i>

573
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:44,698
<i>And not having any sense of</i>
<i>guilt or sympathy.</i>

574
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,302
<i>But I don't know why</i>
<i>they call me anti-social.</i>

575
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:52,697
<i>I have my reasons for stealing.</i>
<i>I'm afraid I'll vanish.</i>

576
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,606
<i>I'm anti-vanishing.</i>

577
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:01,682
<i>They say there's no cure</i>
<i>for being anti-social.</i>

578
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:04,082
<i>But the doctor says to have hope.</i>

579
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:08,081
<i>Sometimes it goes away on its own</i>
<i>30 or 40 years later.</i>

580
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,389
<i>Though usually that 30-40 years</i>
<i>are spent in prison...</i>

581
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:12,888
I see.

582
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:16,791
<i>I admit myself here because</i>
<i>I don't want to go to prison.</i>

583
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:18,000
Taxi!

584
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,797
<i>When I feel it coming on,</i>
<i>I head straight back here.</i>

585
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:25,803
<i>This is my fifth hospitalization</i>
<i>in four years.</i>

586
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:31,070
<i>With steady labor, I can manage</i>
<i>the hospital and medication costs.</i>

587
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:36,180
<i>But do you think I can hold out</i>
<i>for 40 years like this?</i>

588
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,883
<i>Without vanishing into a dot?</i>

589
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,189
What do you think?

590
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:55,597
Just...

591
00:52:58,141 --> 00:52:59,506
Give up hope.

592
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:03,205
And...

593
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:07,576
Keep your strength up!

594
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,584
Strength?

595
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:18,587
But Young-goon has no strength!

596
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:22,498
I never thought you'd open up
about yourself like that.

597
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:27,294
Well, you're getting
shock therapy today.

598
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:29,998
Sul-mi?

599
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,106
People tend to think

600
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:36,508
that shock therapy is inhumane

601
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:38,477
But it isn't really, ma'am.

602
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:42,373
It's a widely used treatment for
depression or catatonia.

603
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:43,577
I see.

604
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,086
There are patients who don't eat.

605
00:53:47,277 --> 00:53:49,336
Because of auditory hallucinations,
delusions, or emotional distress.

606
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:51,738
They usually start eating again

607
00:53:51,881 --> 00:53:54,645
after 2-3 days
when medicated.

608
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:59,546
But Young-goon has such
serious side effects to medication.

609
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:05,049
Young-goon doesn't eat,
sleep, or move.

610
00:54:05,194 --> 00:54:08,357
She throws up her medication.

611
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:10,557
She's completely catatonic.

612
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:13,635
<i>Are there side effects</i>
<i>to shock therapy?</i>

613
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:16,238
There can be some memory loss.

614
00:54:16,372 --> 00:54:21,742
<i>That loss is okay,</i>
<i>but please just make her eat again.</i>

615
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:09,382
You get here?

616
00:55:12,026 --> 00:55:17,089
I should be getting merciless
as soon as possible...

617
00:55:19,901 --> 00:55:23,769
Since I'm the only one
you've got, Granny.

618
00:55:26,908 --> 00:55:28,671
Just wait.

619
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:32,873
I'll get you your dentures

620
00:55:33,514 --> 00:55:35,072
And kill them all.

621
00:55:42,924 --> 00:55:43,788
What?

622
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:46,485
The purpose of...

623
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:49,191
What?

624
00:55:51,499 --> 00:55:53,763
Of existence is...

625
00:56:00,808 --> 00:56:02,469
Slowly.

626
00:56:06,514 --> 00:56:07,981
Granny.

627
00:56:08,516 --> 00:56:09,676
What?

628
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,087
<i>50%</i>

629
00:56:14,622 --> 00:56:15,987
<i>60%</i>

630
00:56:16,824 --> 00:56:18,291
<i>70%</i>

631
00:56:18,926 --> 00:56:20,393
<i>80%</i>

632
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,686
<i>90%</i>

633
00:56:23,431 --> 00:56:25,160
<i>Charging complete!</i>

634
00:56:41,515 --> 00:56:42,675
Are you okay?

635
00:56:44,619 --> 00:56:45,881
Yes.

636
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:47,885
Who am I?

637
00:56:49,423 --> 00:56:52,586
Dr. Choi Seul-ki

638
00:56:52,727 --> 00:56:54,388
Who's the president of Korea?

639
00:56:57,431 --> 00:57:00,059
It's okay. It'll come to you.

640
00:57:00,201 --> 00:57:03,568
That kind of memory skips back soon.

641
00:57:08,409 --> 00:57:10,570
I never knew in the first place.

642
00:57:15,616 --> 00:57:17,379
What do you remember?

643
00:57:17,818 --> 00:57:19,786
Everything.

644
00:57:20,922 --> 00:57:25,484
It was quiet and I was hooked up
with wires all over me.

645
00:57:25,626 --> 00:57:27,787
What else?

646
00:57:27,929 --> 00:57:30,090
In the incubator.

647
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,360
My granny told me.

648
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:38,069
She said I was weak from birth

649
00:57:38,806 --> 00:57:44,767
They were afraid I'd die so
I was in an incubator for a while

650
00:57:46,414 --> 00:57:50,874
Electrical wires came all around
and raised me.

651
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:52,981
Young-goon.

652
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,886
Can you tell me why you won't eat?

653
00:57:57,725 --> 00:58:01,183
Do you hear voices
telling you not to eat?

654
00:58:01,329 --> 00:58:03,388
Are you worried the food
is poisoned?

655
00:58:03,531 --> 00:58:05,465
Do you want to starve
yourself to death?

656
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,461
It's okay

657
00:58:07,601 --> 00:58:10,968
I sometimes
feel like dying, too.

658
00:58:14,608 --> 00:58:17,873
Why would a young lady
like you want to die?

659
00:58:18,713 --> 00:58:20,874
We must carry on living
through thick and thin.

660
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:27,783
I can walk from here.

661
00:58:28,723 --> 00:58:30,588
I can feel my strength coming back.

662
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:36,692
I feel like I've been born again.

663
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:11,164
<i>No hesitating about anything.</i>

664
01:02:22,723 --> 01:02:24,691
<i>No feeling guilty.</i>

665
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:37,264
'I feel so sorry for her
I could die'

666
01:02:40,808 --> 01:02:42,275
'Please take care...

667
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:45,274
of Young-goon.'

668
01:02:48,616 --> 01:02:51,278
'I think I'm feeling...'

669
01:02:54,722 --> 01:02:59,489
'Sym... Sympathy for Young-goon?'

670
01:03:04,398 --> 01:03:07,060
You're saying you feel sympathy?

671
01:03:09,903 --> 01:03:12,463
Please steal Gop-dahn's
sleep flying method.

672
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:18,769
She has developed
a strange way of flying.

673
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:21,875
And she flies to Kyu-suk
every night and troubles him.

674
01:03:25,319 --> 01:03:28,584
I'll give you my voice in exchange.

675
01:03:30,524 --> 01:03:33,391
You're listening to me now so you

676
01:03:33,527 --> 01:03:38,260
can tell how beautiful my voice is.

677
01:03:41,302 --> 01:03:43,065
You think your voice
will be enough?

678
01:03:45,306 --> 01:03:46,568
Go on a hunger strike.

679
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:53,371
Join in the strike, Eun-young.

680
01:04:06,827 --> 01:04:08,488
Steal Eun-young's voice for me.

681
01:04:09,229 --> 01:04:12,357
My flying socks are the second
most important thing to me.

682
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,661
Next to my SK-II cosmetics.

683
01:04:15,302 --> 01:04:16,667
Kyu-suk is mine.

684
01:04:19,506 --> 01:04:24,170
Can you tell me why you are
on a hunger strike?

685
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:28,171
I think it's my fault.

686
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:31,379
Please release Young-goon.

687
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:35,581
Please release her soon.

688
01:04:36,023 --> 01:04:37,388
And you two stay apart!

689
01:04:39,326 --> 01:04:40,486
Everyone.

690
01:04:40,928 --> 01:04:44,091
Do you know why Young-goon
is in the stabilizing room?

691
01:04:44,698 --> 01:04:46,962
She hasn't eaten for
a long time

692
01:04:47,101 --> 01:04:49,160
and is very weak.

693
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:54,570
So she has to eat under the careful
supervision of the staff.

694
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:03,681
If she continues to starve
for 3 more days, Young-goon will die.

695
01:05:06,019 --> 01:05:07,987
Do you understand?

696
01:05:47,828 --> 01:05:51,059
I told you taking food through
the nose tube would hurt.

697
01:05:51,799 --> 01:05:52,857
Let's.

698
01:05:57,004 --> 01:05:58,471
How delicious!

699
01:05:58,605 --> 01:06:01,972
Want to eat now without the tube?

700
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,861
She says she doesn't want to eat!

701
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:29,664
Let me go!

702
01:06:32,005 --> 01:06:33,666
She doesn't want to eat!

703
01:06:34,007 --> 01:06:35,167
Oh, my god! Il-soon!

704
01:06:36,109 --> 01:06:37,770
Il-soon, calm down.

705
01:06:38,612 --> 01:06:40,978
You can't force a patient
without their consent!

706
01:06:42,416 --> 01:06:45,385
She has the right not to eat!

707
01:06:53,827 --> 01:06:54,987
Young-goon!

708
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:59,966
The vending machine says hi.

709
01:07:01,902 --> 01:07:10,367
Young-goon!

710
01:07:10,511 --> 01:07:11,876
Let her go!

711
01:07:14,214 --> 01:07:15,875
She doesn't want to eat.

712
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:20,277
Let her go.

713
01:07:24,024 --> 01:07:25,889
She doesn't want to eat.

714
01:08:10,904 --> 01:08:12,064
Are you okay?

715
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:14,371
I hope you didn't get hurt.

716
01:08:16,209 --> 01:08:19,576
Hold out your hand.

717
01:08:30,123 --> 01:08:31,590
Put them on

718
01:08:31,725 --> 01:08:35,286
Lie on your stomach with your
arms out and rub your feet hard.

719
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:42,168
It makes static electrical tension
and makes your body float.

720
01:08:42,803 --> 01:08:44,168
You don't eat chicken, right?

721
01:08:44,905 --> 01:08:46,566
I'll start singing for you.

722
01:08:46,707 --> 01:08:49,676
When you start floating,
make yourself small.

723
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:54,271
<i>I went across the Switzerland</i>
<i>where all the yodelers be.</i>

724
01:08:54,414 --> 01:08:58,077
<i>I tried to run the mountains and they...</i>

725
01:08:58,218 --> 01:09:01,779
<i>I climb up in the mountains</i>
<i>when a clear sunny day</i>

726
01:09:01,922 --> 01:09:05,483
<i>I met a little Swiss girl</i>
<i>in a Swiss chalet.</i>

727
01:09:05,626 --> 01:09:13,055
<i>She taught me how to yodel.</i>

728
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:19,969
<i>I will teach you how to yodel.</i>

729
01:09:35,722 --> 01:09:39,283
<i>I went across the Switzerland</i>
<i>where all the yodlers be</i>

730
01:09:39,426 --> 01:09:43,089
<i>I tried to run the mountains and they...</i>

731
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:46,757
<i>I climb up in the mountains</i>
<i>when a clear sunny day.</i>

732
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:50,461
<i>I met a little Swiss girl</i>
<i>in a Swiss chalet</i>

733
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:58,170
<i>She taught me how to yodel.</i>

734
01:09:58,311 --> 01:10:05,581
<i>I will teach you how to yodel.</i>

735
01:10:29,009 --> 01:10:31,273
This is the problem!

736
01:10:31,812 --> 01:10:33,177
Look at this face.

737
01:10:37,417 --> 01:10:39,578
It's natural men wouldn't
leave her alone.

738
01:10:48,929 --> 01:10:50,794
You're a cyborg, so you can't eat?

739
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,865
You're a cyborg,
so you don't need to eat?

740
01:10:58,705 --> 01:11:00,673
I'll break down if I eat.

741
01:11:02,109 --> 01:11:03,474
Let's go and eat!

742
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:07,172
Please, Young-goon?

743
01:11:07,614 --> 01:11:09,980
Come on

744
01:11:10,117 --> 01:11:11,584
Let's eat! Why not?

745
01:11:12,419 --> 01:11:15,286
You're a cyborg but you can
still eat and be OK.

746
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,661
Granny!

747
01:11:28,802 --> 01:11:32,568
Young-goon! My child!

748
01:11:32,706 --> 01:11:36,267
Young-goon!

749
01:11:42,716 --> 01:11:46,880
I didn't use them. I just held
them up to see how they looked.

750
01:11:50,524 --> 01:11:52,287
Your teeth will fall out.

751
01:11:53,326 --> 01:11:57,660
Use them only
when you really miss me.

752
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:05,770
Look? My teeth all fell out
because of those dentures.

753
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:11,969
You're lying! You didn't have any
in the first place!

754
01:12:15,215 --> 01:12:19,276
This confounded elastic band!

755
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:22,183
My back is killing me.

756
01:12:22,322 --> 01:12:27,385
Young-goon, you have to let me go.

757
01:12:27,527 --> 01:12:29,893
Young-goon, my dear!

758
01:12:36,903 --> 01:12:40,066
Granny! Granny!

759
01:12:42,209 --> 01:12:43,574
The purpose of...

760
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:44,870
What?

761
01:12:46,213 --> 01:12:48,977
The purpose of existence is what?
Granny!

762
01:12:49,716 --> 01:12:52,276
Granny!

763
01:13:00,827 --> 01:13:02,886
<i>She vanished into a dot.</i>

764
01:13:05,498 --> 01:13:08,262
<i>No being sad.</i>

765
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:17,072
She was cremated and
her ashes laid to rest.

766
01:13:19,512 --> 01:13:21,173
A week ago.

767
01:13:31,825 --> 01:13:36,888
I thought of you and
brought a spoonful.

768
01:13:43,203 --> 01:13:44,568
It's Granny.

769
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,478
They got mixed up.

770
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:15,260
Mom.

771
01:14:17,003 --> 01:14:18,766
It's Young-goon!

772
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:30,478
You didn't tell the people here
you're a mouse, did you?

773
01:14:31,518 --> 01:14:35,978
I mean, a cybor, did you?

774
01:14:41,628 --> 01:14:45,064
You did... didn't you!

775
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,858
How can you think only of yourself?

776
01:14:51,004 --> 01:14:56,374
A person can't just go around
saying everything they want to!

777
01:14:57,610 --> 01:14:58,770
Mom?

778
01:15:00,914 --> 01:15:02,074
Yes?

779
01:15:03,717 --> 01:15:06,083
There's something
I really want to say.

780
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:10,082
What is it?

781
01:15:12,525 --> 01:15:14,390
Granny's dentures...

782
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:18,556
You left them behind on purpose,
didn't you?

783
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,968
So she couldn't eat radishes
at the sanatorium.

784
01:15:26,706 --> 01:15:35,171
Oh, woe, woe is me!

785
01:15:35,815 --> 01:15:42,379
Oh woe, woe is me!

786
01:16:01,608 --> 01:16:09,174
Oh woe, woe is me!

787
01:16:35,408 --> 01:16:38,866
Granny, I'm...

788
01:16:40,313 --> 01:16:47,276
I'm in a position where
being sad is forbidden...

789
01:19:18,304 --> 01:19:20,169
<i>No restlessness.</i>

790
01:19:23,409 --> 01:19:27,971
You have no energy because you let
Gop-dahn have all your food!

791
01:19:45,798 --> 01:19:47,459
White rice with...

792
01:19:49,102 --> 01:19:55,871
Plumes of steam coming up from it.

793
01:19:56,609 --> 01:19:59,271
<i>No useless daydreaming</i>
White winter rice...

794
01:19:59,412 --> 01:20:06,181
If a kebab comes along,
pull out the stick and eat it up.

795
01:20:10,423 --> 01:20:12,391
The persimmon spoke.

796
01:20:14,027 --> 01:20:16,188
I'm shy so...

797
01:20:16,529 --> 01:20:22,468
Please take me in one mouthful.

798
01:20:25,204 --> 01:20:31,473
Winter rice.
Granny's pickled radish.

799
01:20:33,513 --> 01:20:34,878
Spring rice.

800
01:20:36,015 --> 01:20:37,778
Summer rice.

801
01:20:39,319 --> 01:20:41,287
Fall rice.

802
01:20:59,706 --> 01:21:03,164
<i>Silent rice.</i>

803
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:08,074
<i>Holy rice.</i>

804
01:21:08,915 --> 01:21:17,186
<i>All is calm. All is rice.</i>

805
01:21:17,924 --> 01:21:24,853
<i>Round yon virgin mother and child.</i>

806
01:21:25,998 --> 01:21:31,561
<i>Eating noodles, tender and mild.</i>

807
01:21:58,297 --> 01:21:59,958
Her looks are the problem.

808
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:03,960
Oh, you heartbreaker!

809
01:22:17,517 --> 01:22:18,677
Young-goon?

810
01:22:18,918 --> 01:22:20,078
Young-goon!

811
01:22:23,122 --> 01:22:24,783
It's a rice-megatron.

812
01:22:26,025 --> 01:22:29,688
A device that converts food
calories into electrical energy.

813
01:22:30,630 --> 01:22:34,862
So when you eat rice,

814
01:22:35,001 --> 01:22:38,664
It'll compress and explode it

815
01:22:38,805 --> 01:22:40,466
into energy.

816
01:22:42,408 --> 01:22:45,275
Charging takes a long time.

817
01:22:45,411 --> 01:22:47,072
Food is best when you're in a hurry.

818
01:22:47,213 --> 01:22:50,979
Rice is sufficient for regular
everyday electric energy.

819
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:53,981
Isn't it incredible?

820
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,358
Here's the door.

821
01:23:09,602 --> 01:23:11,365
They're usually in back.

822
01:23:12,104 --> 01:23:13,264
Really?

823
01:23:17,109 --> 01:23:18,269
Now...

824
01:23:21,714 --> 01:23:23,477
Please remove your top.

825
01:23:23,616 --> 01:23:24,583
What?

826
01:23:28,221 --> 01:23:31,987
Please remove your top.

827
01:24:31,918 --> 01:24:34,785
I'll have to cut the skin
to open the door.

828
01:25:05,318 --> 01:25:06,478
I'm opening it.

829
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:11,683
No wonder why.

830
01:25:12,825 --> 01:25:14,486
I get itchy there.

831
01:25:16,128 --> 01:25:20,258
It was because the door was there!

832
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:24,460
It's open, so I'm putting in
my hand and attaching the device.

833
01:25:25,004 --> 01:25:26,062
Okay.

834
01:25:27,206 --> 01:25:28,366
I'm going in.

835
01:25:29,809 --> 01:25:32,277
Look at all that dust!

836
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:55,164
I wish I could thank you
for all you've done.

837
01:25:56,202 --> 01:25:59,865
For stealthily stealing
my sympathy before, too.

838
01:26:01,807 --> 01:26:04,071
I'd like to, but...

839
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:08,277
<i>No thankfulness</i>
I'm forbidden...

840
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:11,281
by law to feel thankfulness.

841
01:26:25,197 --> 01:26:26,164
What?

842
01:26:26,298 --> 01:26:28,357
Pickled radish!

843
01:26:53,726 --> 01:26:57,389
One, hold the spoon
with your right hand.

844
01:27:05,504 --> 01:27:11,170
Two, take some rice
and bring it to your mouth.

845
01:27:19,418 --> 01:27:24,185
Three, open your mouth
and put the spoon in.

846
01:27:49,215 --> 01:27:51,080
What if I eat,

847
01:27:51,917 --> 01:27:54,477
And the rice-megatron doesn't work?

848
01:27:57,323 --> 01:28:00,486
I'll fix it.
I'm a technician, remember?

849
01:28:01,927 --> 01:28:05,863
Maybe not now, but what if it
breaks down later?

850
01:28:06,599 --> 01:28:08,066
Or after that?

851
01:28:11,403 --> 01:28:13,371
Call me.
I make house calls for repairs.

852
01:28:14,406 --> 01:28:15,964

Three, open your mouth
and put the spoon in.

860
01:29:10,329 --> 01:29:15,460
Four, close your mouth and
slowly pull the spoon out.

861
01:29:17,703 --> 01:29:18,863
Five.

862
01:29:19,705 --> 01:29:20,865
We're going to chew.

863
01:29:25,010 --> 01:29:28,275
Chew. Chew.

864
01:29:41,927 --> 01:29:43,087
Are you OK?

865
01:29:45,598 --> 01:29:48,362
Six, swallow.

866
01:29:56,709 --> 01:29:58,074
You can do it, Young-goon.

867
01:29:58,811 --> 01:30:04,477
When I count to five and snap,
you'll swallow.

868
01:30:05,517 --> 01:30:06,677
On five.

869
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:08,985
Ready?

870
01:30:10,923 --> 01:30:12,083
One

871
01:30:15,027 --> 01:30:16,289
Two

872
01:30:18,597 --> 01:30:19,154
Three

873
01:32:27,326 --> 01:32:32,263
Granny liked listening to the radio.

874
01:32:33,699 --> 01:32:40,867
Me, too. I lose track of time
listening to the radio.

875
01:32:42,007 --> 01:32:48,469
But, she listened to
keep track of time.

876
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:53,478
Because she was at home all day.

877
01:32:56,822 --> 01:33:02,089
We were listening to the 4:00 show
when mom came home.

878
01:33:03,529 --> 01:33:06,362
With my aunt and uncle.

879
01:33:12,404 --> 01:33:14,565
Young-goon, turn down the radio.

880
01:33:15,808 --> 01:33:17,173
What's that smell?

881
01:33:19,711 --> 01:33:21,975
For crying out loud!

882
01:33:24,216 --> 01:33:29,381
Eating radish all day,
of course it'd stink.

883
01:33:32,925 --> 01:33:35,587
I rest all day and come home to work

884
01:33:35,727 --> 01:33:37,194
with her here like this.

885
01:33:37,329 --> 01:33:40,856
I mean, work all day and
come home to rest.

886
01:33:40,999 --> 01:33:46,266
How could you bear living like this?

887
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:54,679
<i>Granny likes listening to the radio.</i>

888
01:33:54,813 --> 01:33:56,678
She likes this one even more since...

889
01:33:56,815 --> 01:33:58,476
Her clever little Young-goon
made it for her.

890
01:33:58,617 --> 01:34:01,381
Mom, aunt, uncle! Shut up!

891
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,181
We can't hear the radio.

892
01:34:04,423 --> 01:34:06,186
I said, turn down the radio!

893
01:34:06,325 --> 01:34:07,690
It's giving me a headache.

894
01:34:21,106 --> 01:34:24,564
Come on, the ambulance is waiting.

895
01:34:31,116 --> 01:34:33,880
We should have taken her to
the sanitarium way before!

896
01:34:45,797 --> 01:34:47,958
The purpose of existence is...

897
01:35:23,702 --> 01:35:24,964
Doctor?

898
01:35:26,405 --> 01:35:29,067
The secret of my existence.

899
01:35:31,410 --> 01:35:34,777
I have a secret
I'm not supposed to tell.

900
01:35:36,014 --> 01:35:38,073
Shall I tell you?

901
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:46,284
The truth is, I'm...

902
01:36:05,811 --> 01:36:06,971
Young-goon.

903
01:36:09,214 --> 01:36:10,374
That tickles.

904
01:36:21,627 --> 01:36:23,993
So you're a cyborg, Young-goon!

905
01:36:27,399 --> 01:36:29,264
It must have been hard for you.

906
01:36:32,804 --> 01:36:36,365
It's okay, now I know.

907
01:36:37,309 --> 01:36:40,574
After knowing, trusting
is the more important thing.

908
01:36:41,213 --> 01:36:42,475
You trust me, right?

909
01:36:45,317 --> 01:36:49,777
But you know what's most important
after knowing and trusting?

910
01:36:51,923 --> 01:36:55,381
Eating. Eating food.

911
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:22,279
Be?

912
01:37:23,322 --> 01:37:24,482
Me?

913
01:37:25,123 --> 01:37:26,283
Be?

914
01:37:27,225 --> 01:37:28,385
Nee?

915
01:37:29,227 --> 01:37:30,387
Nee!

916
01:37:30,629 --> 01:37:31,755
Knee.

917
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:35,559
Next one.

918
01:37:40,906 --> 01:37:41,372
Da?

919
01:37:41,506 --> 01:37:42,666
A?

920
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:47,874
Yo, Ra, A?

921
01:37:51,316 --> 01:37:52,283
A?

922
01:37:53,919 --> 01:37:54,977
Da?

923
01:37:56,221 --> 01:37:58,086
- Da?
- Da!

924
01:38:03,729 --> 01:38:08,462
You're a nuke bomb your purpose
zov existence zis...

925
01:38:09,201 --> 01:38:13,069
World zend.

926
01:38:13,205 --> 01:38:15,366
Knee da billion bolts.

927
01:38:19,611 --> 01:38:20,669
You're a nuke bomb.

928
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:22,473
A nuke bomb?

929
01:38:23,115 --> 01:38:25,174
Purpose of existence zis...

930
01:38:27,919 --> 01:38:29,181
Zis...

931
01:38:32,724 --> 01:38:35,693
Purpose of existence is.

932
01:38:37,129 --> 01:38:40,860
World zend.

933
01:38:42,501 --> 01:38:47,666
Need a billion volts.

934
01:38:47,806 --> 01:38:51,867
Billion volts?
Need a billion volts. Nuke bomb.

935
01:38:56,415 --> 01:38:57,882
What's a zend?

936
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:03,779
Who's Zend?

937
01:39:07,125 --> 01:39:08,285
Shut up!

938
01:39:44,796 --> 01:39:46,457
Perfect weather, isn't it?

939
01:39:51,503 --> 01:39:54,165
You shouldn't throw trash away
just anywhere.

940
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:04,176
Why not?

941
01:40:07,018 --> 01:40:08,986
It'll all be over once I blow up.

942
01:40:10,322 --> 01:40:10,981
<i>You're a nuke bomb. Your purpose of</i>
<i>existence is the world's end.</i>

943
01:40:11,122 --> 01:40:11,781
<i>Need a billion volts.</i>

944
01:40:11,923 --> 01:40:14,687
Why would a young lady
like you blow up?

945
01:40:15,527 --> 01:40:17,188
We must carry on living
through thick and thin.

946
01:40:27,706 --> 01:40:30,266
Come on, hurry up!

947
01:40:42,721 --> 01:40:46,282
Think there's really a billion volts
in one bolt of lightning?

948
01:40:55,700 --> 01:41:01,764
<i>Round yon virgin.</i>

949
01:41:01,907 --> 01:41:05,172
<i>Eating noodles.</i>

950
01:41:06,111 --> 01:41:07,169
It's cold.

951
01:41:12,317 --> 01:41:13,579
The persimmon.

952
01:41:19,324 --> 01:41:21,087
The rice.

953
01:41:24,029 --> 01:41:26,361
Have you seen the cork for this?

954
01:41:26,598 --> 01:41:29,158
The person who throws away paper

955
01:41:29,301 --> 01:41:30,859
and gum any place probably lost it.

956
01:41:31,002 --> 01:41:32,560
What's he talking about?

957
01:41:34,806 --> 01:41:38,970
The precious wine got rain in it!

958
01:41:52,924 --> 01:41:54,186
What a waste!

959
01:42:05,303 --> 01:42:07,066
What if it doesn't hit me?

960
01:42:07,706 --> 01:42:08,866
Huh?

961
01:42:10,609 --> 01:42:15,171
Just, give up hope and...

962
01:42:26,925 --> 01:42:27,983
Let's keep our strength up!

963
01:42:40,105 --> 01:42:41,470
What do we do now?

964
01:42:44,009 --> 01:42:46,068
Let's just take off
our wet socks anyway.

965
01:43:37,128 --> 01:43:39,460
But they're not the only things wet.

966
01:43:58,717 --> 01:44:00,275
More than our socks are wet.

967
01:44:01,305 --> 01:45:01,171
