I wouldn't let him into my house.

your ability to take
care of yourself.

106
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:46,018

take care of myself,
I always have.

change anything.

00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,093
Yahoo!

179
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:11,987
[horn honking]

180
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:18,494
So long, Joe.

181
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:20,079
Take care, Shirley.

182
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:28,087
Hey, Mommy, [imitates trumptet fanfare].

183
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,089
Me and Angela
are getting married.

184
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,090
Oh, is that so, Angela?

185
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,841
No!

186
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:35,177
See you tomorrow, Rosa.
Okay.

187
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,513
Hey, hey, come on.

188
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:39,014
Hi, Daddy, yah!

189
00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:41,016
Oh, come on, don't do that!

190
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:43,018
Here you go.

191
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:44,019
Hi, hon.

192
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:45,604
Hey.

193
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:38,574
[Man]
Now, you folks up here
are behind the times.

194
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:41,076
Down in Florida, where I come
from, and out in California,

195
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:45,247
we're gettin' to be
a big-time sport and
a big-time business.

196
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:48,751
And don't you think they
don't know it in Detroit.

197
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:52,254
Hell, they're even givin'
away parts, motors, even
the whole damn car.

198
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:54,757
If people go out to
the track and see 'em,

199
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:57,259
they want to go buy
one for themselves.
Hey, Big Daddy?

200
00:17:57,259 --> 00:18:00,646
Why don't you ask those
people in Detroit to give
me one of these beauties?

201
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:03,982
I'd be happy to,
Buddy, if you were
a good enough driver.

202
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,934
Had enough wins
under your belt.

203
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:09,988
How many wins would
it take, do you think?

204
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,824
Would you like Big Daddy's
autograph, darlin'?

205
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:16,578
Well, thanks, but what
I'd really like is, uh, to sit there.

206
00:18:19,448 --> 00:18:25,454
Ah, why the hell not?

207
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:27,456
Come on, I gotta
help you here.

208
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:29,458
Upsy-daisy!

209
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,960
Here we go, right
over here, like this.

210
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:34,463
Put your feet in there.

211
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:35,464
Now sit down, carefully.

212
00:18:35,964 --> 00:18:37,966
Here, let me get this
belt from behind you

213
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:40,219
so we can put it over ya,
that's a girl.

214
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:41,970
That's it,
you're looking good.

215
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,723
Yeah, you look like a
real sprint car driver.

216
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,525
Yes, sir.

217
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,026
A dragster.

218
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,528
See that big
engine up there?

219
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,029
How'd you like
to have that goin'?

220
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,533
The wind blowing through
your face at 180,
190 miles an hour.

221
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,536
Make the lipstick come
right off that pretty,
little face, darlin'.

222
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,183
Jack?

223
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:34,940
Honey? I was thinkin',
why couldn't we get, um,

224
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,492
somthin' heavy like a hemi?

225
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:40,112
Honey, 'cause we haven't even
paid for the 'Vette yet.

226
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:42,698
They might give us one.

227
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:43,999
We've been doin' real good.

228
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:46,785
They might want us
to show them off.
They?

229
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:50,672
Detroit. They pay Big Daddy
to use all their stuff.

230
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,040
Honey, watch out!

231
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,959
Mickey, you don't steal!

232
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:55,928
You see, they took
away the guy's legs.

233
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,846
It's a sin, he can't
even run anymore.

234
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,131
Jack.

235
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,515
All right, look.

236
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:03,018
We're havin' fun.
We're doin' fine.

237
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:06,054
Now don't ruin it
by goin' and makin'
a fool of yourself.

238
00:20:06,054 --> 00:20:09,942
I mean, these guys,
they do it for a livin'.

239
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,227
What the hell, you
think you're Big Daddy?

240
00:20:17,232 --> 00:20:21,153
Up to you, Moose.
On you, Moose.

241
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,070
Moose.

242
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:27,159
Jack, let's drive to Detroit.

243
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,078
Talk to Chrysler,
talk to GM.

244
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:34,666
When they see how good
we're doin', they gotta
give us a car.

245
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,087
Sweetie, it's important to
me that we talk about this.

246
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:40,589
Wanna talk?

247
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:42,975
Okay, we'll talk.

248
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,761
All right?
Now we're gonna talk.

249
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:47,062
Look, we're
gonna go to Detroit,

250
00:20:47,062 --> 00:20:49,982
and if they see us
at all, it's to
laugh in my face!

251
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:52,401
How do we know that
if we don't try?

252
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:55,904
Honey, the last thing they're
lookin' for is a driver

253
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:57,773
who's a housewife from
Schenectady with a kid.

254
00:20:58,073 --> 00:21:00,158
Maybe they don't
care who I am.

255
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,660
Maybe they just
want somebody who wins.

256
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:03,662
They're looking
for a guy, all right?

257
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,664
Somebody that can stick
his hands in an engine,

258
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,165
sell a few spark plugs,
push their product,

259
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,668
like that, that's
not you, okay?

260
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,670
Okay?

261
00:21:18,093 --> 00:21:19,628
There, and the
inning's over, good.

262
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:22,965
Satisfied? Shit.

263
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:36,945
[Shirley]
Listen, honey, Mommy has to
go away for a couple of days.

264
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:39,448
All right? Can you take care
of Daddy while I'm gone?

265
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:42,951
Yeah. Are we gonna go
to Grandpa's on Sunday?

266
00:21:42,951 --> 00:21:45,954
Sure. Grandpa's
makin' spaghetti.

267
00:21:45,954 --> 00:21:48,373
Give me a kiss.

268
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:52,961
Come on, big kiss.

269
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:54,463
Okay, you go
back to sleep.

270
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:56,965
It's very early.

271
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:01,470
Bye.
Bye, sweetie.

272
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:08,310
[bell dings]

273
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:18,820
Mommy!

274
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,323
Hi, honey, did you miss me?

275
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:24,326
Yeah.
What did you do
while I was gone?

276
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:25,277
I fixed Mr. Phillip's starter.

277
00:22:25,827 --> 00:22:26,828
Daddy said it was perfect!

278
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:28,497
Wow!

279
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:29,498
Hi, Buddy.

280
00:22:29,498 --> 00:22:30,449
Hi, Shirley.

281
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,001
Look, sweetie, I gotta
talk to Daddy, okay?

282
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:37,005
You finish working and then,
uh, we'll play, all right?

283
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:50,135
Jack?

284
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,638
Don't, come on,
you'll get greasy.

285
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,649
I thought they'd give me a car,
I really did.

286
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:08,653
The only one that'd even
see me was Chrysler.

287
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:11,289
And that was after
waiting for hours.

288
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,627
They were real nice, too.

289
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:19,464
They said they'd give
me a car if I paid for it.

290
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:39,651
I hope you learned something, Shirl.

291
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:48,660
While you were out on
your joy ride, me and Buddy
were talkin' things over.

292
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,663
And I figure, what the hell,
I can build a dragster.

293
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:54,166
Class A, run on any
quarter-mile track around.

294
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,035
N.H.R.A., the whole deal.

295
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,204
Really?
Yeah, really.

296
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:01,540
And I'll tell you somethin'
else, with the upkeep

297
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,542
and modifications
on the 'Vette,

298
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,128
it'd be cheaper running
a damn dragster.

299
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:09,131
And look, I don't want you
worryin' about money,

300
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:10,098
entry fees,
anything like that.

301
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:12,551
I'm gonna handle
all that stuff.

302
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:18,056
All you gotta do is
take care of the kid...
and drive.

303
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:20,559
Oh, baby, I missed you so much.

304
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:22,027
I missed you, too.

305
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:28,150
[Announcer]
Elapsed time of 11:53 at

Sign your arm?

316
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,258
You're not gonna
wash it off, are ya?

317
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,260
You better not.

318
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:03,768
## So happy together ##

319
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:08,273

## And you and me ##

326
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,539
## No matter how they
toss the dice ##

327
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:26,424
## It had to be ##

328
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,426
## The only one
for me is you ##

329
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,928
## And you for me ##

330
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:33,431
Sir, if you go to
the Tri-Cities and you
wanna check Lebanon Valley,

331
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,051
you're gonna find out
about Shirley Muldowney
and Jack Muldowney.

332
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:40,555

## And you and me ##

339
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,571
You see me run?

340
00:25:56,571 --> 00:25:58,406
No.

341
00:25:58,707 --> 00:26:01,626
You've come all the way out here
and you missed the main attraction?

342
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:03,461
Well, what the hell,

343
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,831
I'm just gonna have to run
it one more time just for you.

344
00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:09,718
Connie Kalitta.

345
00:26:09,718 --> 00:26:12,220
Hi. Look, I'm trying to get
ready for a race here, okay?

346
00:26:12,721 --> 00:26:15,724
Well, don't give me
that. Gimme your name.

347
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:16,641
Shirley Muldowney.

348
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,093
Please, if you don't mind.

349
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:21,846
This is a beauty.

350
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:25,850
This is one of the nicest
I've ever seen, in all
my years of runnin'.

351
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,851
I mean it.

352
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:31,356
Great chassis.
Comfy seat.

353
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,358
Nice big headlights.

354
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:34,693
Dragsters don't
have headlights.

355
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:37,912
They don't?

356
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:45,370
I tell you what, Miss, uh, Shirley,
uh... Muldowney.

357
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,591
Muldowney. Why don't you come
check out the Bounty Hunter.

358
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:54,462
Come on! It's the fastest and the
only-est funny car on this track.

359
00:26:54,462 --> 00:26:55,964
Come on, I'm not gonna bite you.

360
00:26:55,964 --> 00:26:57,932
[Man]
I need to know
the person driving it

361
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,934
is gonna get down that track
without killing themselves

362
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:02,437
or a bunch of--
If you give us a test--

363
00:27:02,437 --> 00:27:07,359
Why don't you drive?
I'm not a driver.
I'm a mechanic.

364
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,361
Okay.

365
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,313
I just gotta get something
from the truck, okay?

366
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,649
Be right back.

367
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,788
Hey. Come on.

368
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,243
Connie Kalitta, right?

369
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,461
Yeah.

370
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:28,380
This is my son, John.

371
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,799
Mr. Kalitta's one of those creeps
your dad's always talking about.

372
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:33,251
Oh, hey.

373
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,553
How you doin', big guy?
Nice to meet you.

374
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,088
Oh, hey!

375
00:27:37,305 --> 00:27:39,808
That's some grip you got
there, John Muldowney.

376
00:27:40,175 --> 00:27:45,730
Whoa, you're a big, strong guy to have such
a young, beautiful momma like you do.

377
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:49,184
He's big enough to watch your old man's
car while you check out mine.

378
00:27:49,184 --> 00:27:50,602
It's not my
old man's car.

379
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:52,103
It's our car.

380
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:54,906
My husband's the mechanic.
I'm the driver.

381
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:57,609
Well, pardon me,
Mrs. Muldowney.

382
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:00,445
I meant no offense.

383
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:02,447
Boy, I sure hope
you can drive cars

384
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:03,948
better than you can take compliments.

385
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:09,254
I hope you can drive
better than you give 'em.

386
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:12,040
Are you crazy, man, you want
me to break my hand?

387
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,541
Can I help you
with somethin'?

388
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:17,045
Well, only if you got some
influence with this lady here.

389
00:28:17,045 --> 00:28:21,800
Yeah, this lady
is my wife.

390
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,302
Hey, this is
embarrassing, man.

391
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:28,690
I, uh...I'm Connie.

392
00:28:29,057 --> 00:28:31,142
Kalitta.

393
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:35,146
Hey, this is a great
machine you guys got here.

394
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:36,948
I'll tell you what.
Let's have dinner sometime.

395
00:28:37,198 --> 00:28:40,285
I'll get my wife, make
it a foursome, say, uh,

396
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:43,405
Sunday, after I set
this place on its ass,
what do you say?

397
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:45,824
We'll let you know.

398
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:53,832
You hurt me, boy.

399
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,339
Carlos, you sucker.

400
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,258
Come on, go work
on the carburetor.

401
00:29:03,258 --> 00:29:04,259
Oh, come on!

402
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:06,261
Come on.
So, what's the deal?

403
00:29:06,261 --> 00:29:08,263
When are we up,
what's our number?

404
00:29:08,263 --> 00:29:10,265
Well, I'll tell you.
It's our first time here.

405
00:29:10,265 --> 00:29:11,766
We never worked
on this track before.

406
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:14,269
So I'm thinkin' we
should just watch today,
see how things go.

407
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:16,271
What are you
talking about?

408
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:17,772
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

409
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:20,275
That's what
I'm talkin' about.
Or the car.

410
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:23,278
Shirl, I want to make
damn sure you're not
in over your head.

411
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:28,283
What did we
come here for?

412
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:30,285
All right, look.

413
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:32,670
It doesn't look like
they're gonna let you run.
Why?

414
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,672
Well, they don't
think it's safe for you.

415
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,674
And I'm not so sure I don't
agree with them.

416
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,793
Well, what am I
talkin' to you for?

417
00:29:38,793 --> 00:29:41,296
You're gonna run away and make a
fool of yourself again.

418
00:29:41,296 --> 00:29:43,882
I'm telling you that!
Because you're pig-headed!

419
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,718
Damn it to hell.

420
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:50,722
Excuse me.

421
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,223
You can't come
in here, baby.

422
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,725
I just want to talk
to an official.

423
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:57,145
You don't have a pass.
This is a private affair.
Lou, please.

424
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:02,283
Sir, excuse me.
My name's Shirley Muldowney.

425
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,119
I just came a hundred
miles to race, and, uh,

426
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,371
someone's telling me I can't.

427
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,457
I'd like to know why.

428
00:30:09,457 --> 00:30:12,460
Young lady. Just because
someone gave you a car

429
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:14,963
does not give you
the right to race it.

430
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:16,464
Well, you're the
man in charge, right?

431
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:19,467
Yes, I am, and it is my job
to ensure the safety

432
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:20,919
of the spectators
and the other drivers.

433
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:24,422
Well, I understand that, but I'm not
some kid out for a joy ride,

434
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:25,924
I'm an experienced driver.

435
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,759
So your husband
mentioned, Mrs. Muldowney.

436
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,261
But your experience is in amateur
events in street machines.

437
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:32,096
We have rules,
now, Lou, please.

438
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,318
You have rules against
a woman driving?

439
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:40,188
No, not exactly.

440
00:30:40,188 --> 00:30:42,190
Okay then, well,
suppose I'm a man,

441
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,193
and all I've done is race amateur
local events in street machines.

442
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:49,697
Now, what do I have to do?
There are procedures.

443
00:30:49,697 --> 00:30:51,499
Where are these procedures?
In your head?

444
00:30:51,699 --> 00:30:53,284
No, they're not.

445
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,786
Well, could I see them, please?

446
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,176
Thank you.

447
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:08,099
Say I have to have a qualified car,
a dragster, 130 miles per hour.

448
00:31:11,352 --> 00:31:13,855
Three accredited drivers have
to sign for my license.

449
00:31:14,355 --> 00:31:17,942
So, doesn't say anything
here about not being a woman.

450
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:21,613
Or are you gonna stop me
from getting the signatures?

451
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:23,448
[laughing]

452
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:28,403
I'm applying for my competition driver's
license and I need three signatures.

453
00:31:28,903 --> 00:31:31,906
No way.

454
00:31:31,906 --> 00:31:33,875
It's not for a woman.

455
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:35,910
Thank you.

456
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:45,837
Excuse me.

457
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,306
Are you a licensed N.H.R.A. driver?

458
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:49,307
Sure.

459
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,309
I need some signatures.

460
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:55,813
I don't believe in signing nothing, sweetheart.

461
00:31:55,813 --> 00:32:01,019
Hey, why don't you fix
me some bacon and eggs?

462
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:05,023
Would you sign my application
for my N.H.R.A competition...

463
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,025
Right. Thank you.

464
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:18,036
Would you sign my application
for my competition driver's license?

465
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,045
Jack?

466
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,547
Look. All we gotta
get is three signatures.

467
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,049
Then they gotta
let us race.

468
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,551
It's the rules, whether
I'm a man, a woman,
or a kangaroo.

469
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,553
Look, don't go to
war with these people.

470
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,057
Jack, I'm not fighting.
I just want to race.

471
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:43,061
I can't get any of these
clowns to sign this damn thing.

472
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:44,562
Honey, that's what I ran into.

473
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,565
Look at it from
the N.H.R.A. point of view.

474
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,567
Maybe if you go with
me they'll sign it.

475
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,070
Listen, honey, he said if a woman
got in an accident

476
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,572
it could set the whole
sport back 10 years.

477
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,074
Jack, are you
gonna help me?

478
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:59,243
If I help you or not
it's not gonna matter.

479
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,003
Excuse me.
Remember me?

480
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:15,309
I'd like your autograph now.

481
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:20,314
Class A, huh?

482
00:33:20,314 --> 00:33:22,433
Okay.

483
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:26,437
What the hell, might as well get some
of you gals out of the kitchen

484
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,439
and into the stands.

485
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:36,447
There you go, my dear.

486
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,949
Thanks.

487
00:33:54,966 --> 00:34:00,938
Eh, this paperwork is such bullshit.

488
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,974
You just need one more and that's it, huh?

489
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:06,978
Yeah, that's right,
thanks a lot.
No problem.

490
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:07,812
Hey, Tiny.

491
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,484
Oh, no, I asked him already.

492
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:16,487
Hey, Tiny, come here.

493
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,906
Hey buddy, why don't you put
your John Hancock right there.

494
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:20,792
Hey, man, I told her I ain't signin' nothin'.

495
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:23,127
Look at the names on that list, man.

496
00:34:23,544 --> 00:34:26,047
Big Daddy Garlits, Connie
Kalitta, you'll go down
in history, come on.

497
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,049
Yeah, well, thanks anyway.

498
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:32,003
Tiny, you still lookin' for
your torque wrench, man?

499
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,471
Hey, man, that's mine.

500
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,923
That's right, I borrowed it
from you, didn't I?

501
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:37,925
Gainesville, I think
it was '64.

502
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:40,928
You son of a bitch.
Sign it.

503
00:34:47,268 --> 00:34:50,772
Thank you.

504
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:54,025
Just try not to run over anybody, okay?

505
00:34:57,028 --> 00:35:01,249
See, all you gotta do is just be
nice to the other drivers.

506
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,202
How's it comin', guys?

507
00:35:04,585 --> 00:35:06,170
All right, race fans.

508
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,672
You're not going to
believe what's up next.

509
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,173
'Cause I know
I don't believe it.

510
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,175
But, here goes.

511
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:14,679
We've got a late entry from
Schedectady, New York.

512
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:20,184
Welcome the first lady to
try and qualify in an A dragster

513
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,886
for an N.H.R.A. competition.

514
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,974
Shirley Muldowney.

515
00:35:27,475 --> 00:35:31,979
This is a real surprise here at
the 1966 E town Summer Challenge.

516
00:35:31,979 --> 00:35:35,116
This is Shelley,
I mean, Shirley Muldowney.

517
00:35:35,116 --> 00:35:38,452
And she's trying for her N.H.R.A.
competition driver's license.

518
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:43,825
She's driving that A gas dragster
that's powered by a small-block Chevrolet.

519
00:35:44,325 --> 00:35:46,327
You know, this car, well,
it ought to run

520
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:48,162
about 145, maybe
150 miles an hour.

521
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:50,081
Come on,
get out of here.

522
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:53,634
I wonder if Shirley has got it in
her to hold that throttle pedal down

523
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:56,971
all the way through that quarter mile.
That's a tough run.

524
00:35:57,471 --> 00:35:59,757
She's got to make
a single run by herself.

525
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:01,592
There's nobody else out
on that racetrack.

526
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:04,228
[engine revving]

527
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:09,233
Her pit crew looks like a little kid
and that must be her husband, Mr. Muldowney.

528
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,736
What's this, a kiss
on the starting line?

529
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,739
What's drag racing
coming to?

530
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,191
[engine revving]

531
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:21,412
As Shirley Muldowney
gets set to make her run.

532
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:25,833
Don't forget, she's gotta go over
130 miles an hour on this pass

533
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:27,618
to earn her
competition license.

534
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,537
[engine revving]

535
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,214
She's got good traction.

536
00:36:57,315 --> 00:37:01,819
Wahoo!

537
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:06,791
We have a speed
of 155 miles an hour?

538
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:13,130
And a lap time of...
is this right, Vern?

539
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:17,335
A 9.2? Well, hell, that's a
new track record.

540
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:21,172
Wahoo!

541
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:22,556
Come on, come on!

542
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:23,557
Wahoo!

543
00:37:23,557 --> 00:37:26,560
I'm holdin' you responsible, Kalitta.

544
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,562
Hey, your mom is
a hell of a driver!

545
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:31,098
And you built
a hell of a car, man.

546
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:49,667
Shirley Muldowney has indeed set a new
track record for the A dragster class.

547
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:08,936
Track record! 9.2!

548
00:38:08,936 --> 00:38:12,440
155 miles an hour!

549
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,941
N.H.R.A., take that!

550
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:29,540
Every time we come
to this restaraunt,

551
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,543
old Mr. Ling likes to break
out his smutty fortune cookies.

552
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,545
Isn't that true
Oh, yes.

553
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:38,049
Wait...wait a minute,
you mean he puts dirty
fortunes in the cookies?

554
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,334
Oh, yeah. Come on, Jack,
crack yours open.

555
00:38:40,334 --> 00:38:42,003
Maybe he dealt you a hot one.

556
00:38:42,003 --> 00:38:45,506
Old Mr. Ling is peeking at us
through a hole in the wall right now.

557
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:47,508
Man's a total pervert.

558
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:51,095
The future holds
great things for you.

559
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,347
Hear that, Shirl, there's
great things for us.

560
00:38:53,347 --> 00:38:54,598
Smart cookie.

561
00:38:54,815 --> 00:38:56,817
Hey, there's no fortune.

562
00:38:57,151 --> 00:38:59,770
Excuse me.

563
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,273
Conn, my cookie's empty.

564
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:05,276
Well, what do you want me to do, honey?
I don't stuff ’em.

565
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:09,280
Aw, sweetie, I'll
get you another one.

566
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:16,787
So you and the boy go with Shirley
every time she runs, huh?

567
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,289
Yes, ma'am.

568
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:22,793
You're lucky. I hardly ever
get to go anywhere with Connie.

569
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,796
I guess if you want a regular
home and a regular family,

570
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:29,550
somebody's gotta stay and mind it.

571
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:33,187
[Connie]
Hey, Junie, how you doin'?
What's goin' on?

572
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:34,688
What do you mean, who's this?

573
00:39:35,189 --> 00:39:39,193
It's me, the Conn. What's goin' on?

574
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,196
I'm callin' you now.

575
00:39:42,196 --> 00:39:45,199
Yeah.

576
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,492
Now, you listen to me, okay?

577
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:57,411
I'm sure there's lots of lad
out there who think this little,

578
00:39:57,411 --> 00:40:00,214
um, puppy dog act
of yours is real cute.

579
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,049
I'm not one of them.

580
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:06,053
To me, you're just a lousy bum.

581
00:40:06,053 --> 00:40:08,973
The only thing
I do fast is drive.

582
00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:20,484
Cha cha cha.

## Back to the love
and the laughter ##

## Lord what a far
distant shore ##

585
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:41,088

did I want you ##

00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:54,768
## You know you
taught me to love you ##

## Did you know you
taught me how to cry ##

589
00:41:00,774 --> 00:41:06,280
## Mmm hmm, did you know you
taught me how to cry ##

590
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,367
Come on, Pop.
Let's go.

591
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:14,321
Okay. It's the damn car.

592
00:41:14,321 --> 00:41:17,741
If it weren't for that jalopy
I'da left here at midnight.

593
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:22,746
Now, you tell
your mom that.

594
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,915
I got something
to show you.

595
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,928
You did good?

596
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:38,846
I broke the track record.

597
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:46,353
I'm so proud of you,
Shirley Ann.

## In dreams,
my memories ramble ##

you taught me how to cry ##

607

## Sometimes I dream
of a woman ##

me to dream girl ##

The Oregon primary
continues to draw

612
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,324
several presidential
hopefuls today.

613
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,326
Vice President
Hubert Humphrey says he has

614
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,328
a brand-new
campaign technique.

615
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:24,835
Military leaders in Vietnam
have been told to win the war
within the next 3 months.

00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:26,253
Jack, slow down.

617
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,123
I didn't think I'd ever go
too fast for you, Shirl.

618
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:35,045
...to escape fighting in
the Northeastern suburb
of that capital city.

619
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:37,014
Jack, be careful.
John's gonna get hurt.

620
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:41,602
I told you, I strapped him in
myself, nothing's gonna happen.

621
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:50,978
Honey, let me drive.

622
00:43:50,978 --> 00:43:52,563
Oh, no, no.

623
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:55,566
Boy, drivin' you to your races
fixin' that dragster,

624
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,818
that's my most important
job, right, Shirl?

625
00:43:57,818 --> 00:43:58,702
Oh, come on.

626
00:44:01,622 --> 00:44:03,991
You come on!

627
00:44:08,128 --> 00:44:10,414
All right, Jack,
what do you want?

628
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:12,499
You want to go home?
We'll go home.

629
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,335
I'll tell you
what I want.

630
00:44:14,835 --> 00:44:17,338
I want to stop running
around every weekend crazy.

631
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:19,590
And I want to stop wasting my money.
Your money?

632
00:44:19,807 --> 00:44:24,311
Maybe you want me to work for Buddy the
rest of my life, but that's not what I want.

633
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:27,815
Wait a minute, Jack, you're not the only
one bringing home a paycheck around here.

634
00:44:27,815 --> 00:44:30,818
I want you to start being a regular wife.

635
00:44:30,818 --> 00:44:34,104
What?

636
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:37,107
Look, I built that thing back there
so we'd have fun with it.

637
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,109
And now it's our
goddamn life.

638
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,611
You don't want
to race anymore?

639
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:42,112
I'm not sayin' that.

640
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:45,416
Look, it's a nice hobby.
But that's all it is ever gonna be.

641
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:47,451
The sooner you grow
out of it, the better.

642
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,086
It's not a hobby.

643
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:56,343
Oh, what are you thinkin',
you're a professional racer?

644
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:00,798
Big Momma,
Shirley Muldowney, woo.

645
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,933
Well, let's see all
the cars you built.

646
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:05,436
Or let's see all
the money you won.

647
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,137
I got a better idea.

648
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,139
Why don't you go to Detroit
with your 2-bit trophies

649
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,141
and your one
hot shit track record.

650
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:16,196
And let's see if they
give you a sponsor now, huh?

651
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,031
Don't you see?

652
00:45:18,532 --> 00:45:20,534
Your job is to take
care of me and John.

653
00:45:21,034 --> 00:45:26,156
And if you concentrate on it,
you'll be a lot happier.

654
00:45:26,407 --> 00:45:28,659
Now believe me.

655
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:42,556
You gonna be all right?

656
00:45:42,923 --> 00:45:45,509
Yeah, don't worry about me.

657
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:49,513
Don't worry about the car, either, 'cause
I could tune that in my sleep.

John! Let's go!

664
00:46:16,757 --> 00:46:19,092
It was just a couple of years
ago that Shirley

665
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:21,962
got her license
right here at Englishtown.

666
00:46:21,962 --> 00:46:24,465
But she's not even qualified
for the program yet.

667
00:46:24,465 --> 00:46:28,018
And if she doesn't make it on this run,
she won't be racing tomorrow.

668
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,521
Hey, remember your old buddy?

669
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:32,022
Hey, yeah!

670
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:34,024
Hey, I got you a present.

671
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:36,527
Start your own scrapbook.
Hey, thanks a lot.

672
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:40,531
Yeah, all you gotta do is point it in the
right direction and just pull the trigger.

673
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:42,032
Okay, thanks.

674
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:50,707
Hey, check that out.
It's a lady.

675
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,963
[Announcer]
We hope she's okay.

676
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:49,967
But for Shirley Muldowney,
what a tough break.

677
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,937
There'll be no racing tomorrow
for the lady dragster driver.

678
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:55,973
Just get that pissed
that you gotta fight it,

679
00:47:56,356 --> 00:47:58,442
and I have to have
all these things broken.

680
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:02,229
Nothin' would have been broken if you
hadn't tried to run it so lean.

681
00:48:02,229 --> 00:48:04,731
That's not it. Shirley Muldowney won't
lift off and lose a race.

00:48:04,731 --> 00:48:08,735
That's what it is.
I got a burned engine and
I don't know what the hell

683
00:48:08,735 --> 00:48:10,988
it's gonna cost me,
'cause you don't back off!
Yeah?

684
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,489
Yeah.
How do we know that, huh?

685
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,491
How do we know it was me?

686
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:16,493
Maybe it was you screwed up.

687
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:18,996
I wasn't tossin' back
beers all afternoon.

688
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,498
See, I'm not perfect.

689
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,500
And, uh, cars aren't perfect.

690
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,720
But Shirley Muldowney, she is perfect.

691
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,555
Why don't you have a go at it, Shirl?

692
00:48:29,056 --> 00:48:30,474
Come on, take a shot at the car.

693
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:34,978
Hey, no, no way, you can tune
her in your sleep, right?

694
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,647
[Connie]
Threw a rod, huh?

695
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:37,431
Shitty luck.

696
00:48:37,431 --> 00:48:39,766
You guys had a real
pretty run going, too.

697
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:44,521
You know, I'd richen up the engine just
a bit so it don't run so lean in the end.

698
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:50,410
Couldn't you feel
it nosin' over?

699
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:53,530
When it gets like that, man,
you gotta get off...

700
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,416
I never forget, one time I was
in Baton Rouge...

701
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:58,118
Really?

702
00:48:58,118 --> 00:49:00,621
That's interesting. Thank you
very much, I appreciate it.

703
00:49:00,621 --> 00:49:03,340
I'll remember that.

704
00:49:10,263 --> 00:49:15,185
Just a few more words of wisdom
from your favorite lousy bum.

705
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,727
Hey, sport, you get any
good pictures of me yet?

706
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:27,397
Yeah, thanks a lot.

707
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:32,402
Sorry.

708
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,712
Hey!

709
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:45,716
I tell you, I don't appreciate
you hittin' on my wife.

710
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:48,218
What?

711
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:51,722
Hey, we go out and have dinner a
couple of years ago and, um,

712
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:57,177
I come by and say hello again and now you're
puttin' 2 and 2 together and gettin' 10.

713
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:14,494
Oh, hey, my tools are yours,
so if you feel like it

714
00:50:14,494 --> 00:50:16,997
come on over, we'll rummage
through a few things and, uh,

715
00:50:16,997 --> 00:50:20,000
maybe you can get another
crack at qualifying.

716
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,002
Thanks, man. Thanks a lot.

717
00:50:22,502 --> 00:50:24,504
All right.

718
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:45,025
## To everything
turn turn turn ##

719
00:50:45,025 --> 00:50:50,030
## There is a season
turn turn turn ##

720
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:54,451
## And a time to every
purpose under Heaven ##

721
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:59,239
## A time to be born ##

722
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:01,241
## A time to die ##

723
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:03,243
## A time to plant ##

724
00:51:03,243 --> 00:51:05,245
## A time to reap ##

725
00:51:05,245 --> 00:51:06,747
## A time to kill ##

726
00:51:06,747 --> 00:51:08,749
## A time to heal ##

727
00:51:08,749 --> 00:51:11,752
## A time to laugh ##

728
00:51:11,752 --> 00:51:16,339
## A time to weep ##

729
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:21,928
## To everything
turn turn turn ##

730
00:51:21,928 --> 00:51:26,933
## There is a season
turn turn turn ##

731
00:51:26,933 --> 00:51:31,688
## And a time to every
purpose under Heaven ##

732
00:51:34,574 --> 00:51:35,992
## A time to build up ##

733
00:51:36,576 --> 00:51:38,078
## A time to break down ##

734
00:51:38,578 --> 00:51:40,080
## A time to dance ##

735
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,083
## A time to mourn ##

736
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:46,086
## A time to
cast away stones ##

737
00:51:46,586 --> 00:51:52,092
## A time to gather
stones together ##

738
00:51:52,592 --> 00:51:56,096
The summer of...what the hell
summer is it anyway?

739
00:51:56,096 --> 00:51:57,597
I'm losing track.

740
00:51:57,597 --> 00:52:03,520
Anyway, to a lot more wins,
and a lot more good times!

741
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,556
All right.
Here you go.

742
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:08,058
Oh, look at that
stuff bubble up.

743
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:09,476
Here you are.

744
00:52:09,476 --> 00:52:10,894
Here it is, Jack.

745
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:13,396
I got a better toast.

746
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:17,818
To a long winter's rest
is my toast.

747
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:19,653
Jack, can I see you for a minute?

748
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,956
I got a customer that has a problem,
something's wrong with his car.

749
00:52:22,956 --> 00:52:25,458
So I figured maybe you
could give him a hand.

750
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:29,713
Yeah, no problem.

751
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:42,642
I guess it'd be time for you to break out
that winter gear, hmm?

752
00:52:45,145 --> 00:52:47,147
Yeah, but not you, right?

753
00:52:47,647 --> 00:52:51,651
You got it, I'm going where the
weather's warm and tracks are hot.

754
00:52:53,153 --> 00:52:56,740
Come on, a track's a track.

755
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,742
It's a whole other thing down South.

756
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:01,745
Out West, Gainesville, Orange County.

757
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:04,364
Compared to that,
this is minor league.

758
00:53:04,865 --> 00:53:05,866
You oughta see it.

759
00:53:05,866 --> 00:53:07,367
I'd like to.

760
00:53:07,367 --> 00:53:08,869
Well then you should!

761
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:10,871
The prize money they
got there, the sponsors.

762
00:53:10,871 --> 00:53:13,373
You guys'd have a pro
operation goin' in no time.

763
00:53:13,373 --> 00:53:16,877
Jack is a much better
mechanic than even he knows.

764
00:53:17,377 --> 00:53:22,265
And, Shirley, you got more damn
raw talent than I've ever seen.

765
00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:26,603
All you need to go major
league is to just want to.

766
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:34,611
I don't know.
It's all very nice.

767
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:38,114
Very nice
and very far away.

768
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:40,567
California, my God.

769
00:53:40,567 --> 00:53:43,570
Yeah, there's a lot
of decisions gotta be made.

770
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:48,375
From now on, I'm gonna
run top fuel all the way.

771
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:49,876
You're the first to know.

772
00:53:50,377 --> 00:53:54,881
I'm gonna kick Garlits' ass up and
down every track there is, man.

773
00:53:54,881 --> 00:53:57,384
What do you think?

774
00:53:57,384 --> 00:53:59,386
I think it's great.

775
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:09,095
I also think you got a funny car you
won't need anymore, right?

776
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:17,187
Hey, Jack?

777
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:20,690
How would you feel about keepin'
the racin' goin' all year?

778
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:25,195
Not stoppin'.

779
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:28,198
Hey, John! John, come on down,
we're leavin'.

780
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:29,199
Jack, listen to me.

781
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:30,700
We could do real good.

782
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,202
Dad.

783
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:34,704
Come on, say goodnight to
Angela, I said we're leaving.

784
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:36,206
We could do great out West.

785
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:37,207
We'd get sponsors.

786
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:40,877
We'd be major league,
there's big prize money.

787
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:43,380
And I'm talkin' about
racin' a funny car.

788
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,385
Connie's movin' up to top fuel,
he said he'd sell us his funny.

789
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,353
Yeah?
Yeah.

790
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:52,973
Because he knows we can't afford it.

791
00:54:52,973 --> 00:54:54,665
We don't have to
give him anything now.

792
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:56,254
We'd pay him when we can.

793
00:54:56,254 --> 00:54:58,757
Jack, I know what I'm talking about.

794
00:54:58,757 --> 00:55:01,009
Sweetie, you're the best mechanic there is.

795
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:03,094
You're tops.

796
00:55:03,595 --> 00:55:05,930
Sure.

797
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,932
Come on, John!

798
00:55:07,932 --> 00:55:10,435
Jack, we can do it.

799
00:55:10,435 --> 00:55:15,440
Maybe we couldn't do it before, but
John's not a problem now, he's a big boy.

800
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,943
We don't even have to drag him around
with us, he can stay at Mom's.

801
00:55:18,943 --> 00:55:21,946
It can work.
Oh, sorry, I didn't know
you guys were talkin'.

802
00:55:21,946 --> 00:55:23,899
No, we're not,
we're leavin'.

803
00:55:24,233 --> 00:55:25,817
Jack, I want
to talk about this.

804
00:55:25,817 --> 00:55:27,820
Just listen to what
Connie has to say, okay?

805
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:30,321
I don't give a shit
what Connie's got to say.

806
00:55:30,321 --> 00:55:31,823
I say we don't race no more.

807
00:55:31,823 --> 00:55:34,827
Excuse me, I don't
mean to butt in, but, uh,

808
00:55:34,827 --> 00:55:37,329
if she wants to race,
uh, why don't you just--

809
00:55:37,329 --> 00:55:41,250
Why don't you just
stick it up your ass.

810
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,752
Dad, come on,
me and Angela--

811
00:55:42,752 --> 00:55:45,254
I don't need lip from you, all right?
Not from you.

812
00:55:45,254 --> 00:55:48,140
Ow! Okay.
Come on, get in the car.

813
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,676
Now you get in.
I said get in that car.

814
00:55:50,676 --> 00:55:52,478
No.
Get in the car!

815
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:59,603
No.

816
00:56:24,594 --> 00:56:27,097
Shirley.
You all right?

817
00:56:32,103 --> 00:56:34,604
You need a ride home?

818
00:56:35,106 --> 00:56:37,607
Come on.

819
00:57:18,517 --> 00:57:19,901
[Jack] Hey!

820
00:57:20,101 --> 00:57:21,570
Hey, now you got
a funny car, huh?

821
00:57:21,853 --> 00:57:23,272
Is that funny
enough for you?

822
00:57:23,571 --> 00:57:27,442
I'll come down and we'll both have
a good laugh, all right, Shirl?

823
00:57:40,004 --> 00:57:42,007
Hey! Where do you
think you're goin'?

824
00:57:42,007 --> 00:57:44,543
Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doin'?

825
00:57:51,851 --> 00:57:52,851
Get out of that car!

826
00:57:52,851 --> 00:57:55,470
Get out!
I said get out!

827
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,105
Come on,
get out of there!

828
00:57:57,105 --> 00:58:00,192
Get out of here!

829
00:58:00,192 --> 00:58:01,944
Aw, shit.

830
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:04,124
[phone ringing]

831
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:14,134
Jack, I don't want to talk about it,
put John on the phone.

832
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:15,269
Mom.
It's me,

833
00:59:15,269 --> 00:59:17,721
Hi, honey.
Where's Daddy?

834
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:22,059
He's okay.
He's sleeping on the couch.

835
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,478
Don't wake him.

836
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:28,983
Okay, honey,
just listen to me.

837
00:59:28,983 --> 00:59:33,487
I can't explain it
real good right now.

838
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:38,492
I can't be with
your Dad anymore, okay?

839
00:59:38,876 --> 00:59:44,466
You just, um, go to school
and take care of yourself.

840
00:59:44,466 --> 00:59:49,971
Okay, and, um, as soon as I get
settled I'll come and get you.

841
00:59:50,472 --> 00:59:51,473
All right?

842
00:59:51,473 --> 00:59:53,975
If you need to talk
about anything with me,

843
00:59:53,975 --> 00:59:57,979
or if you need anything
just, um, call Grandma.

844
00:59:57,979 --> 01:00:00,515
Okay, she'll know
where I am.

845
01:00:00,515 --> 01:00:02,517
How long 'til
you're settled?

846
01:00:02,517 --> 01:00:07,605
Not long, honey.
I promise.

847
01:00:08,106 --> 01:00:11,109
John? Mommy loves
you so much.

848
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:18,117
On Tuesday, aren't we gonna sign me up
for the model building class at the Y?

849
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,621
Oh, John, I'm sorry.

850
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:26,125
Um, you want
to go with Grandma?

851
01:00:26,125 --> 01:00:29,628
Tell you what,
I'll call Grandma tomorrow.

852
01:00:29,628 --> 01:00:30,512
Okay.

853
01:00:30,512 --> 01:00:33,933
Don't worry about me, Mom.

854
01:00:33,933 --> 01:00:35,935
I never worry about you.

855
01:00:35,935 --> 01:00:36,886
You're my big boy.

856
01:00:36,886 --> 01:00:40,856
Mom, I love you too.

857
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,812
Okay, honey, I'll
talk to you real soon.

858
01:00:47,313 --> 01:00:47,813
Okay.

859
01:00:48,314 --> 01:00:50,817
Okay...bye bye.

860
01:00:50,817 --> 01:00:52,818
Bye.

861
01:01:30,907 --> 01:01:33,827
## And I only have eyes ##

862
01:01:38,415 --> 01:01:40,918
## For you ##

863
01:01:40,918 --> 01:01:44,871
## Sha bop sha bop ##

864
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:48,926
## Sha bop sha bop ##

865
01:01:48,926 --> 01:01:52,930
## Sha bop sha bop ##

866
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:55,633
## Sha bop sha bop ##

867
01:01:56,133 --> 01:01:58,051
[Connie]
What you're lookin' at
is something that's gonna

868
01:01:58,051 --> 01:01:59,637
stand drag racing
right on its ear.

869
01:01:59,637 --> 01:02:02,139
I'm not talking about some bimbo
hangin' all over a car.

870
01:02:02,139 --> 01:02:03,641
I'm talkin' about
puttin' a beautiful woman

871
01:02:03,641 --> 01:02:05,143
right there in
the driver's seat.

872
01:02:05,143 --> 01:02:09,113
Can't you just hear Cha Cha sayin',
"Corral your gal with Lariat"?

873
01:02:09,113 --> 01:02:11,149
She's beautiful.

874
01:02:11,149 --> 01:02:13,651
Look at her eat those
press people up, I tell ya.

875
01:02:14,152 --> 01:02:16,404
Cha Cha!
Call her Cha Cha!

876
01:02:16,404 --> 01:02:20,909
Cha Cha, what's a beautiful girl like
you doin' racin' in a place like this?

877
01:02:20,909 --> 01:02:21,876
Winning.

878
01:02:21,876 --> 01:02:23,411
[laughing]

879
01:02:23,912 --> 01:02:25,913
If you don't believe it, come
down to the track Sunday.

880
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:27,915
Cha Cha, what do you
think of women's lib?

881
01:02:28,217 --> 01:02:31,637
She thinks it's horse shit.

882
01:02:31,637 --> 01:02:37,175
Well, that's what Connie thinks, but,
uh, we all know what he's full of.

883
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:42,648
[laughing]

884
01:02:42,648 --> 01:02:45,149
Terrible teenagers.

885
01:02:45,149 --> 01:02:47,019
Hey, open up in there!
It's the police!

886
01:02:50,772 --> 01:02:52,191
Hi, Mom.

887
01:02:52,441 --> 01:02:54,026
John, come on.

888
01:02:54,026 --> 01:02:55,694
What's going on in here?

889
01:02:55,694 --> 01:02:56,695
[Shirley]
Got a big race tomorrow.

890
01:02:57,196 --> 01:02:59,414
Hi, Connie.

891
01:02:59,414 --> 01:03:01,416
See you tomorrow.
Yeah, good stuff today.

892
01:03:01,416 --> 01:03:03,418
Yeah, we'll have
a better day tomorrow.

893
01:03:03,418 --> 01:03:04,419
Really, John,
time to go.

894
01:03:05,004 --> 01:03:07,005
Yeah.

895
01:03:07,005 --> 01:03:08,041
Good night.

896
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:09,542
Night night.

897
01:03:19,052 --> 01:03:20,470
[laughing]

898
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:32,732
[Announcer]
On the right-hand lane,
a special treat.

899
01:03:33,066 --> 01:03:37,153
A young lady from the East
Coast making her first
ever West Coast appearance.

900
01:03:37,655 --> 01:03:38,621
Cha Cha Muldowney.

901
01:03:38,988 --> 01:03:41,241
In the tower lane
is going to be Art Foster.

902
01:03:41,824 --> 01:03:42,826
They're set. The start.

903
01:03:42,826 --> 01:03:45,044
Both drivers get all the
traction they can handle.

904
01:03:45,044 --> 01:03:46,546
This is a good race.

905
01:03:46,546 --> 01:03:49,999
Until half track, Cha Cha Muldowney
is pulling ahead of Art Foster.

906
01:03:49,999 --> 01:03:52,136
And she takes the win light.

907
01:03:52,136 --> 01:03:55,973
A 6.55 for Cha Cha improves
on her qualifying time.

908
01:03:55,973 --> 01:03:59,976
215 miles an hour
to poor Art's 6.75.

909
01:03:59,976 --> 01:04:02,229
He's gonna take a lot of ribbing
about this in the pit area.

910
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:06,183
The lady got to him, and has to
make believers out of a lot of you

911
01:04:06,183 --> 01:04:07,685
as Cha Cha goes
into the second round.

912
01:04:08,185 --> 01:04:11,187
Announcing races all over the country,
I have had a chance to follow

913
01:04:11,187 --> 01:04:15,075
Cha Cha's career a little bit from the
outlaw tracks in New York and New Jersey

914
01:04:15,075 --> 01:04:18,445
up through a nice little A dragster
that finally set a national record.

915
01:04:18,946 --> 01:04:22,416
In fact, Cha Cha was so impressive
that N.H.R.A. finally just had to relent

916
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:27,621
on their long-standing policy of allowing
female drivers only in the stock car ranks.

917
01:04:28,088 --> 01:04:31,626
You consider that Connie Kalitta and
Don Garlits were first to sign her license.

918
01:04:31,626 --> 01:04:36,130
She is in Connie Kalitta's funny car,
now appropriately called the Bounty Huntress.

919
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:38,133
Now, Kalitta has spent
thousands and thousands

920
01:04:38,133 --> 01:04:39,933
of dollars to field
this car for Cha Cha.

921
01:04:40,134 --> 01:04:42,637
Okay, I suggest you find
a seat in the grandstands

922
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:45,105
because you don't want to miss this.

923
01:04:45,105 --> 01:04:49,361
Big Daddy Don Garlits up against the
Bounty Hunter from Michigan, Connie Kalitta.

924
01:04:49,728 --> 01:04:53,698
Garlits, the black car, the winningest
drag racer ever in any category.

925
01:04:53,698 --> 01:04:56,701
Can I see those?

926
01:04:56,701 --> 01:04:58,703
[Announcer]
This has been a tremendous
step forward safety-wise.

927
01:04:58,703 --> 01:05:00,071
The engine now
behind these drivers.

928
01:05:00,322 --> 01:05:02,707
The hot oil and fire
is not right in their face.

929
01:05:02,907 --> 01:05:06,795
Now, in the right-hand lane, the first
driver to ever top 200 miles an hour.

930
01:05:07,162 --> 01:05:09,464
Connie Kalitta,
the Bounty Hunter.

931
01:05:09,464 --> 01:05:12,834
These two have been going at each other's
throats since the late '50s.

932
01:05:13,169 --> 01:05:16,806
And it's been many years since you California
fans have seen them side by side

933
01:05:16,806 --> 01:05:17,673
in this state.

934
01:05:17,972 --> 01:05:19,057
Kalitta in the far lane.

935
01:05:19,557 --> 01:05:23,062
Big Daddy Garlits
on the tower side.

936
01:05:27,817 --> 01:05:31,270
At half track, Kalitta's
car is skating around a bit.

937
01:05:37,109 --> 01:05:42,782
Stay back. Do not go
down to that crash site.

938
01:05:43,165 --> 01:05:44,700
You'll only be in the way.

939
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:47,703
Our well-trained O.C.I. emergency
crew is already rolling.

940
01:05:48,204 --> 01:05:49,955
They are on the way.

941
01:05:50,206 --> 01:05:52,541
You've got to stay back,
ladies and gentlemen.

942
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:54,043
Please, back
into your seats.

943
01:05:54,543 --> 01:05:57,546
As soon as I have some word on the
condition of Connie Kalitta

944
01:05:57,546 --> 01:05:59,048
I will pass it along to you.

945
01:05:59,048 --> 01:06:00,599
Please believe me,
I will do that.

946
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:03,303
We've got to get
everybody out of there.

947
01:06:03,303 --> 01:06:04,637
You have got
to get back, folks.

948
01:06:04,887 --> 01:06:06,473
Kalitta's crew is there.

949
01:06:06,473 --> 01:06:11,478
They are moving very carefully from
what's left of that top fuel dragster.

950
01:06:11,478 --> 01:06:13,979
Cha Cha Muldowney is
on the scene to help.

951
01:06:13,979 --> 01:06:16,565
Our own emergency crews
are rolling to the scene.

952
01:06:16,565 --> 01:06:19,536
But they will be there just
as soon as they can get there.

953
01:06:19,536 --> 01:06:22,571
But please, ladies and gentlemen,
we've got to get everybody out of there.

954
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:26,410
Connie Kalitta is on his feet!

955
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:27,494
He is waving to the crowd.

956
01:06:28,078 --> 01:06:32,082
I guess that got their attention.

957
01:06:46,681 --> 01:06:48,182
Cheese!

958
01:06:48,182 --> 01:06:50,768
Good, help, no, John, don't
blow out the candles.

959
01:06:51,269 --> 01:06:52,820
You want me to wait
until you take the picture?

960
01:06:53,404 --> 01:06:54,439
The other side,
come around the other side.

961
01:06:55,021 --> 01:06:56,023
Okay, good.

962
01:06:56,023 --> 01:06:57,525
Honey, would you
move in there, too?

963
01:06:58,024 --> 01:06:59,526
All three of you get
real close together.

964
01:06:59,526 --> 01:07:01,446
Mom, would you
take the picture?

965
01:07:01,446 --> 01:07:05,450
When I say 1-2-3, I want
a really big smile, okay.

966
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:11,005
1-2-3, cheese.
[phone ringing]

967
01:07:11,005 --> 01:07:12,006
Hello.

968
01:07:12,006 --> 01:07:13,458
[Jack]
Happy birthday.
Dad.

969
01:07:14,008 --> 01:07:15,843
Hey, listen, what'd
you think of the gift?

970
01:07:15,843 --> 01:07:19,347
The gift. Oh, yeah, um, the gift.

971
01:07:19,347 --> 01:07:23,434
Just somethin' that I'd
want when I was your age.

972
01:07:23,434 --> 01:07:26,437
You know, you could use it
the best way you see fit.

973
01:07:26,437 --> 01:07:31,392
Oh, Dad, look, this $100
is gonna be great.

974
01:07:31,392 --> 01:07:33,395
[Connie]
Happy birthday!

975
01:07:33,395 --> 01:07:35,897
Okay, everyone, we
can start the party now!

976
01:07:35,897 --> 01:07:37,398
Mrs. Roque, so nice to see you again.

977
01:07:37,398 --> 01:07:39,902
Hello, Connie. I'd like you to
meet my wife, Mary Ann.

978
01:07:39,902 --> 01:07:42,404
[Mary Ann] Hello.
[Mrs. Roque] It's nice to meet you.

979
01:07:42,821 --> 01:07:43,906
[Connie]
You must be Linda, Shirley's sister.

980
01:07:44,406 --> 01:07:45,874
Shirley talks about you all the time.

981
01:07:45,874 --> 01:07:48,911
Hey, John Muldowney, birthday boy,
get off that phone.

982
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:49,912
I got something for you.

983
01:07:50,412 --> 01:07:50,913
[John]
Hi, Connie.

984
01:07:51,413 --> 01:07:52,915
[Connie]
Take a look at this.

985
01:07:52,915 --> 01:07:54,917
Go ahead, strap it on.
[John]
That's great, Connie.

986
01:07:55,417 --> 01:07:57,920
[Connie]
Hey, where's your mom?

987
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,422
You okay?

988
01:08:00,422 --> 01:08:03,927
Yeah, great.

989
01:08:03,927 --> 01:08:06,428
What am I supposed to do?
Leave her at home?

990
01:08:06,428 --> 01:08:09,933
[Mrs. Roque]
Come on in, everyone, look at this.

991
01:08:09,933 --> 01:08:13,485
Grandfather's guitar.

992
01:08:13,485 --> 01:08:14,938
Mom, did you see
Grandpa's guitar?

993
01:08:15,355 --> 01:08:17,490
What do you think?

994
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:19,324
This is great.

995
01:08:19,575 --> 01:08:22,195
Hi, Mary Ann.

996
01:08:22,195 --> 01:08:23,112
Hello.

997
01:08:26,032 --> 01:08:28,501
Get this away from me.
Get yourself away from it.

998
01:08:28,501 --> 01:08:32,288
I can't believe you're not helping, would
you take this? This is awful, I'm getting fat.

999
01:08:42,432 --> 01:08:44,934
Don't strain yourselves.

1000
01:08:49,306 --> 01:08:52,442
Cha Cha, I got
something to show you.

1001
01:08:52,775 --> 01:08:53,860
Hey, Mrs. Roque.

1002
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:59,033
John Muldowney, get your
birthday butt out here, boy.

1003
01:08:59,033 --> 01:09:00,617
What do you think,
is this incredible?

1004
01:09:01,118 --> 01:09:04,622
It's a big one.
How 'bout that, huh?

1005
01:09:04,622 --> 01:09:09,159
All right.
That's some car.

1006
01:09:09,493 --> 01:09:12,580
Know who's gonna be first to
ride it in competition? You.

1007
01:09:17,634 --> 01:09:20,220
I just had to come back over.

1008
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:23,223
I'm sorry about before, my,
uh, crazy situation.

1009
01:09:27,227 --> 01:09:30,731
You're the number one most
important thing in my life.

1010
01:09:32,734 --> 01:09:36,103
All right, Carlos, my man,
let's see how fast...

1011
01:11:11,117 --> 01:11:13,703
Mom!

1012
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:16,768
Come on, let's go, let's get her
to the hospital, come on!

1013
01:12:16,768 --> 01:12:18,186
It's gonna be all right.

1014
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:37,205
[Announcer]
Third match point
for Billie Jean King.

1015
01:12:45,631 --> 01:12:49,134
You watch Bobby, he'll behave
like a perfect gentleman.

1016
01:12:49,635 --> 01:12:54,640
And so this is what it's come down to,
here in the Houston Astrodome.

1017
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,644
Billie Jean fought for equal pay for
women in the U.S. Open tennis tournament

1018
01:12:58,644 --> 01:13:00,646
and got it.

1019
01:13:00,646 --> 01:13:04,650
All of the women of America, or at least
most of them, seem to be caught up

1020
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:07,069
with the anticipation
of this match.

1021
01:13:28,474 --> 01:13:30,476
Excuse me. Hi.

1022
01:13:30,476 --> 01:13:32,929
I'm looking for Mrs. Shirley
Muldowney's room.

1023
01:13:32,929 --> 01:13:35,982
Oh, she's B171, it's right
down the hall on your right.

1024
01:13:35,982 --> 01:13:38,484
Thank you.

1025
01:13:48,161 --> 01:13:49,028
Hi.

1026
01:13:53,367 --> 01:13:57,288
Got here as soon
as I could.

1027
01:13:57,787 --> 01:14:01,792
It sure ain't
been our season.

1028
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:04,628
My flying business
has been crazy.

1029
01:14:04,628 --> 01:14:07,598
I've been traveling all over.

1030
01:14:08,015 --> 01:14:10,601
I got, uh, caught
in some rough weather.

1031
01:14:10,601 --> 01:14:16,190
Otherwise I would
have been here sooner.

1032
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:19,193
Sorry about that damn blower.

1033
01:14:19,193 --> 01:14:21,195
As soon as I can,
I'm going over,

1034
01:14:21,195 --> 01:14:24,281
I'm gonna beat the shit out of
that guy who sold it to me.

1035
01:14:29,787 --> 01:14:32,073
Baby.

1036
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:37,962
I hit some rough air.

1037
01:14:37,962 --> 01:14:39,546
Really.

1038
01:14:44,051 --> 01:14:49,090
She smooth it out for you?

1039
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:50,057
Rita?

1040
01:14:50,592 --> 01:14:52,594
That's Carlos'
little sister, man.

1041
01:14:53,093 --> 01:14:56,096
Carlos asked me to do him a favor,

1042
01:14:56,096 --> 01:14:59,100
so I flew her down
here to be with him.

1043
01:14:59,517 --> 01:15:01,403
Shirley, come on!

1044
01:15:01,653 --> 01:15:03,738
Have you ever seen her?

1045
01:15:03,738 --> 01:15:06,741
Hey, I'm talkin' bow wow, man.

1046
01:15:06,741 --> 01:15:08,076
Okay, I'm gonna go get her.

1047
01:15:08,276 --> 01:15:09,861
'Cause I don't want
you worryin' about nothin'

1048
01:15:10,362 --> 01:15:12,414
when you should be
taking care of yourself.

1049
01:15:19,421 --> 01:15:21,423
Aw, baby.

1050
01:15:21,423 --> 01:15:23,926
Oh, Connie, it was horrible.

1051
01:15:23,926 --> 01:15:26,929
I was so scared.

1052
01:15:26,929 --> 01:15:30,932
I know. I know.

1053
01:15:30,932 --> 01:15:33,685
Baby, I love you.

1054
01:15:33,685 --> 01:15:37,106
I got that stuff from the pharm--

1055
01:15:37,106 --> 01:15:38,607
Hey.

1056
01:15:38,607 --> 01:15:40,608
Thanks, sweetie.
I got it, thank you.

1057
01:15:41,027 --> 01:15:42,777
You need anything else?

1058
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:46,032
No, honey, thanks.

1059
01:15:54,824 --> 01:15:57,743
I look like shit.

1060
01:15:57,743 --> 01:16:01,247
Yep.

1061
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,165
Hello, Dad, it's John.

1062
01:16:03,165 --> 01:16:04,667
Hey, John, how you doin'?

1063
01:16:04,667 --> 01:16:06,168
I'm all right.

1064
01:16:06,168 --> 01:16:08,672
I'm callin' from California.
Sorry to call you at work.

1065
01:16:08,672 --> 01:16:10,173
Don't worry about it.

1066
01:16:10,173 --> 01:16:12,675
Mom was in a fire, and, uh,
she's in the hospital.

1067
01:16:12,675 --> 01:16:14,176
She was in an accident?

1068
01:16:14,176 --> 01:16:17,179
Yeah, well, she burned her arm
and around her eyes pretty bad.

1069
01:16:17,179 --> 01:16:19,182
But doc says she's
gonna be all right.

1070
01:16:19,182 --> 01:16:21,184
The damn funny car,
she can't handle it, John.

1071
01:16:21,184 --> 01:16:23,687
No, Dad, it wasn't her fault
or anything like that.

1072
01:16:23,687 --> 01:16:25,188
We were trying this new
goddamn blower

1073
01:16:25,188 --> 01:16:28,692
and it just went off like a bomb.
Just like that, really.

1074
01:16:28,692 --> 01:16:32,696
So I's thinkin', look, you think maybe
you could give her a call here or somethin'?

1075
01:16:32,696 --> 01:16:35,700
I think she'd like to hear from
you, you know, she's real down.

1076
01:16:36,199 --> 01:16:40,203
It's not gonna do any good for me
to tell her I told you so, you know?

1077
01:16:40,203 --> 01:16:42,205
Well, you don't have
to say that, Dad.

1078
01:16:42,205 --> 01:16:44,207
Listen, John, the boss
left me here alone.

1079
01:16:44,207 --> 01:16:47,711
Look, just give her a call or something,
Dad, you know, just say hello.

1080
01:16:47,711 --> 01:16:50,714
I will. Take care of yourself, okay?
John, I gotta get goin'.

1081
01:16:51,215 --> 01:16:55,218
Dad, if you change your mind give us
a call, we're at Orange County Memor--

1082
01:16:55,218 --> 01:16:57,722
Memorial Hospital.

1083
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:21,496
I'd like to talk to you about
the new 1973 cars from Chrysler.

1084
01:17:22,046 --> 01:17:25,666
Now, these beautiful models represent
the state of the art in engineering.

1085
01:17:42,151 --> 01:17:44,153
Hey, baby.

1086
01:17:44,153 --> 01:17:47,656
It's great to see you.
Me, too.

1087
01:17:47,656 --> 01:17:49,158
I couldn't wait.

1088
01:17:49,657 --> 01:17:52,161
Come on.

1089
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,163
It's good to be back.

1090
01:17:54,163 --> 01:17:55,664
How you feelin'?
Missed you.

1091
01:17:55,664 --> 01:17:57,666
How's your arm?

1092
01:17:57,666 --> 01:17:59,668
Oh, it's better.
It's coming along.

1093
01:17:59,668 --> 01:18:01,954
Here you go.

1094
01:18:01,954 --> 01:18:05,040
Let me see those peepers.

1095
01:18:10,346 --> 01:18:13,048
Ralph, just give
me 5 more minutes.

1096
01:18:13,048 --> 01:18:15,718
You got one.
I can't get it done in one, man!

1097
01:18:16,051 --> 01:18:19,139
I'm just now coming up
on the Bounty Hunter pits.

1098
01:18:19,139 --> 01:18:21,473
Oh, boy, this car is
a long way from being ready.

1099
01:18:21,975 --> 01:18:23,775
I can't allow you
more time, now move it.

1100
01:18:23,775 --> 01:18:25,727
Is the clutch done?
Almost.

1101
01:18:25,727 --> 01:18:27,313
Don't give me almost!
Come on!

1102
01:18:27,313 --> 01:18:28,815
I'm not about to get in their way.

1103
01:18:29,315 --> 01:18:30,817
They need all the time they can get.

1104
01:18:31,317 --> 01:18:32,819
But there is an interesting spectator here.

1105
01:18:32,819 --> 01:18:34,237
Shirley "Cha Cha" Muldowney.

1106
01:18:34,737 --> 01:18:38,324
Her arm bandaged but looking surprisingly
well considering your recent funny car fire.

1107
01:18:38,324 --> 01:18:41,995
How you feeling?
I'm feeling fine, Steve, thank you,
it's good to be back.

1108
01:18:42,545 --> 01:18:45,548
All of us are anxious to know what
your future plans are, Shirley.

1109
01:18:45,548 --> 01:18:49,053
Well, Steve, at this time I don't
have any definite plans.

1110
01:18:49,053 --> 01:18:52,338
I can say one thing for sure.
I'm through with funnys.

1111
01:18:52,555 --> 01:18:55,642
You're not gonna make it. You're out.
Bullshit to that!

1112
01:18:55,926 --> 01:18:58,562
[Shirley] That's not what I said.
I said I'm through with funnies.

1113
01:18:58,562 --> 01:19:00,980
I'm not getting in
another funny car.

1114
01:19:01,315 --> 01:19:03,399
And I will have
more on this later.

1115
01:19:03,399 --> 01:19:04,401
Okay, thank you, Shirley.

1116
01:19:04,901 --> 01:19:07,104
Shirley is rushing off to
catch up with Connie Kalitta,

1117
01:19:07,104 --> 01:19:09,606
who just stormed away from
here after an official.

1118
01:19:09,606 --> 01:19:11,107
His car has already
been scratched.

1119
01:19:11,107 --> 01:19:13,943
Back to the tower.

1120
01:19:16,197 --> 01:19:18,165
Drivers only!

1121
01:19:18,165 --> 01:19:19,500
Lady, I said...

1122
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,416
[screaming]

1123
01:19:20,416 --> 01:19:24,838
Asshole!

1124
01:19:30,377 --> 01:19:33,047
And now, Chrysler, which
is the top of the line...

1125
01:19:33,047 --> 01:19:35,549
It'll quicken the hearts of...

1126
01:19:37,268 --> 01:19:40,354
Connie, come on, Connie!

1127
01:19:41,356 --> 01:19:43,857
Connie, hold it!

1128
01:19:47,444 --> 01:19:49,030
It's over.

1129
01:20:01,126 --> 01:20:05,130
Unbecoming my ass!

1130
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:06,631
How long?

1131
01:20:07,132 --> 01:20:09,634
Indefinite suspension.

1132
01:20:09,634 --> 01:20:11,136
Why don't they just say forever.

1133
01:20:11,636 --> 01:20:13,339
I'll tell you what the hell this is.

1134
01:20:13,339 --> 01:20:15,840
This is television, that's
all they give a shit about.

1135
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,842
Their lousy bread. They
don't give a shit about us!

1136
01:20:17,842 --> 01:20:20,845
Just there own hot shit
image, their damn revenue.

1137
01:20:21,314 --> 01:20:24,350
They think they're
the son-of-a-bitchin' NFL.

1138
01:20:24,849 --> 01:20:28,353
Give me a rum and coke.
Forget about the coke.

1139
01:20:28,854 --> 01:20:30,655
Assholes.

1140
01:20:30,855 --> 01:20:32,440
What the hell
are you lookin' at?

1141
01:20:32,942 --> 01:20:34,944
Nothin', I'm just
enjoying the weather.

1142
01:20:34,944 --> 01:20:38,446
Connie, come on.

1143
01:20:38,446 --> 01:20:41,951
This used to be a good time sport,
you know?

1144
01:20:41,951 --> 01:20:43,953
Shit.

1145
01:20:43,953 --> 01:20:48,457
People hangin' out. Gettin' rowdy.

1146
01:20:48,457 --> 01:20:54,130
Tryin' to make us into damn golf.

1147
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:57,133
Think they'll make me wear a dress?

1148
01:20:57,133 --> 01:20:59,136
Maybe that'd be a good idea.

1149
01:20:59,635 --> 01:21:04,140
What the hell, why not buy
yourself an asbestos bikini?

1150
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:09,145
Cha Cha Muldowney,
the funny car stripper.

1151
01:21:09,145 --> 01:21:12,482
Connie, I'm gonna run top fuel.

1152
01:21:12,699 --> 01:21:16,153
You're gonna go up against
Garlits, Graham, those guys?

1153
01:21:16,153 --> 01:21:16,987
I'm gonna win.

1154
01:21:17,287 --> 01:21:18,871
Oh, yeah?

1155
01:21:18,871 --> 01:21:20,790
Well, why the shit not?
What the hell?

1156
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:22,159
Television'll love you.

1157
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:23,660
You'll sell a lot of beer.

1158
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:26,663
You build the car.
I'll drive it.

1159
01:21:26,663 --> 01:21:27,881
You be my crew chief.

1160
01:21:28,465 --> 01:21:29,966
They can't stop you
from doin' that, right?

1161
01:21:30,467 --> 01:21:33,969
That's beautiful, me, a crew chief?

1162
01:21:33,969 --> 01:21:35,255
Is that what you're sayin'?

1163
01:21:35,472 --> 01:21:37,424
Connie, I'm talkin' about
keeping you in racing, honey.

1164
01:21:37,724 --> 01:21:40,394
I'm talking about keeping us together.

1165
01:21:40,394 --> 01:21:42,346
Keepin' us goin'.

1166
01:21:45,315 --> 01:21:48,820
Look, I'll tell you what.

1167
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:53,690
When you're ready to talk
about this, I'll be upstairs.

1168
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:55,575
What, what?

1169
01:21:55,826 --> 01:21:57,327
Hey, lady, buy you a drink?

1170
01:21:57,695 --> 01:22:00,865
Shirley!

1171
01:22:00,865 --> 01:22:03,868
It's me, Mickey.

1172
01:22:03,868 --> 01:22:06,371
Mickey.
How are you?

1173
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:07,872
Oh, baby,
how are you?

1174
01:22:07,872 --> 01:22:09,374
Oh, you're lookin' wonderful!

1175
01:22:09,374 --> 01:22:10,842
Yeah, big bucks.

1176
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:13,294
So, you got married, huh?

1177
01:22:13,594 --> 01:22:14,679
Yeah, hey, better late than never.

1178
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:16,631
I've got a couple of kids, look.
No.

1179
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:23,805
Shirley Muldowney!
You know what I think?

1180
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:26,307
I think top fuel,
why the hell not!

1181
01:22:26,808 --> 01:22:28,811
I'm gonna be the best
damn crew chief.

1182
01:22:28,811 --> 01:22:30,812
And you're gonna be
the best damn driver.

1183
01:22:30,812 --> 01:22:34,315
And I'm gonna make you top fuel
champion of the whole damn world.

1184
01:22:34,315 --> 01:22:37,819
Connie Kalitta's gonna ram
Cha Cha Muldowney right up their asses!

1185
01:22:38,202 --> 01:22:39,070
Kalitta.

1186
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:40,371
Mickey White.

1187
01:22:40,371 --> 01:22:45,461
That is, if you still want me.

1188
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:59,141
[Announcer]
1975, Cha Cha Muldowney
with Connie Kalitta

1189
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:02,644
as her crew chief breaks into
the top 15 for the first time.

1190
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:06,315
Hey, Cha Cha, smile.

1191
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:09,401
[Announcer]
1976, Cha Cha Muldowney

1192
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:14,190
becomes the first woman ever to win
an N.H.R.A. national event.

1193
01:23:16,525 --> 01:23:20,779
1977, Shirley "Cha Cha" Muldowney
has won 3 national events in a row

1194
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:25,284
and is this year's favorite to
capture the world championship.

1195
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:29,588
Sunday! Sunday!

1196
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:34,427
Big Daddy Don Garlits himself versus
Shirley "Cha Cha" Muldowney.

1197
01:23:34,427 --> 01:23:37,931
They'll pound the ground and smoke
the tires to 230 miles an hour.

1198
01:23:37,931 --> 01:23:39,432
Will the lady tame this one?

1199
01:23:39,432 --> 01:23:41,935
Will Big Daddy put
the lady in her place?

1200
01:23:41,935 --> 01:23:46,222
Sunday! Sunday! Shirley "Cha Cha" Muldowney
taking on all the big boys! Be there!

1201
01:23:46,473 --> 01:23:50,560
With us, in case any of you don't
recognize him, is Big Daddy Don Garlits.

1202
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,564
He is still the man to beat in any drag race.

1203
01:23:53,564 --> 01:23:57,066
But even he can't deny the performance
of this Kalitta-Muldowney car.

1204
01:23:57,066 --> 01:23:58,568
Can you?

1205
01:23:58,568 --> 01:24:01,572
Well, you know, Steve, in my
experience, a good built car

1206
01:24:01,572 --> 01:24:04,575
can give a few wins to
almost any average driver.

1207
01:24:04,575 --> 01:24:08,578
If you call winning three
national events in a row,

1208
01:24:08,578 --> 01:24:14,468
in one year, um, average, what
would you call your record?

1209
01:24:14,468 --> 01:24:16,970
Well, I'm just lookin' forward to the
little lady showin' her nerves

1210
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:17,972
when it really counts.

1211
01:24:17,972 --> 01:24:20,474
I don't think she can handle it.

1212
01:24:20,474 --> 01:24:22,476
There you have it, there's
only one place this argument's

1213
01:24:22,976 --> 01:24:24,311
gonna be settled
: on the race track.

1214
01:24:24,562 --> 01:24:26,931
Shirley! Shirley! Can
I have your autograph?

1215
01:24:26,931 --> 01:24:30,985
Sure.

1216
01:24:30,985 --> 01:24:33,687
Good luck, Donald!

1217
01:24:33,687 --> 01:24:35,073
Good luck to you too, darlin'.

1218
01:24:36,407 --> 01:24:38,409
#### [French]

1219
01:24:43,915 --> 01:24:45,916
Oh, bonjour, good afternoon,

1220
01:24:45,916 --> 01:24:48,919
and welcome once again to
John Paul's Country Kitchen.

1221
01:24:48,919 --> 01:24:54,426
Today we have on the celebrity table
[speaking French] a very special guest.

1222
01:24:56,927 --> 01:25:00,215
[speaking French]
Cha Cha Muldowney!
[speaking French]

1223
01:25:00,381 --> 01:25:02,467
The world's fastest woman.

1224
01:25:02,851 --> 01:25:05,937
Yes, that's as in drag racing.

1225
01:25:05,937 --> 01:25:07,272
I race top fuel dragsters.

1226
01:25:07,556 --> 01:25:08,640
We had a tape.

1227
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,475
A tape?
We have a tape?

1228
01:25:10,725 --> 01:25:13,695
Roll the tape, please.

1229
01:25:13,695 --> 01:25:17,199
Ah, yes, there we are.
This is the Spring Nationals.

1230
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:19,200
That's me racing Don Garlits.

1231
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:22,572
That's me beating Don Garlits.

1232
01:25:22,871 --> 01:25:25,957
I love beating Donald,
he's such a bad loser.

1233
01:25:25,957 --> 01:25:28,828
That was my crew. My son, John,
and Rahn Tobler.

1234
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:33,748
Cha Cha is here with us in Montreal
for the Grand National Auto Race.

1235
01:25:33,748 --> 01:25:37,253
And also to prepare
for us her favorite dish.

1236
01:25:37,253 --> 01:25:39,255
And that dish is, Cha Cha?

1237
01:25:39,255 --> 01:25:42,757
Excuse me, it's Shirley,
it's just Shirley Muldowney.

1238
01:25:43,259 --> 01:25:45,678
That's right,
Cha Cha, lasagna.

1239
01:25:46,062 --> 01:25:49,014
We start with a layer of the pasta.

1240
01:25:49,398 --> 01:25:52,935
And sometimes the pasta
tends to stick together.

1241
01:25:52,935 --> 01:25:55,905
Oh, yes, lasagna does that.

1242
01:25:56,238 --> 01:25:57,823
You know, there's
a good trick for that.

1243
01:25:58,324 --> 01:26:01,444
If you put a little oil in
he water when you're cooking it,

1244
01:26:01,661 --> 01:26:03,447
the pasta won't stick together as much.

1245
01:26:03,447 --> 01:26:04,447
Thank you, Cha Cha.

1246
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:06,917
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

1247
01:26:06,917 --> 01:26:09,952
It's Shirley, okay,
it's not Cha Cha.

1248
01:26:10,202 --> 01:26:11,921
Shirley Muldowney.

1249
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:20,514
[phone ringing]

1250
01:26:25,518 --> 01:26:26,520
Hello.

1251
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:28,021
[Woman]
Am I speaking to Shirley?

1252
01:26:28,522 --> 01:26:31,024
Yes.

1253
01:26:31,024 --> 01:26:32,526
I know Connie's with you.

1254
01:26:33,026 --> 01:26:35,529
I think it's only
honest that I talk to you.

1255
01:26:36,029 --> 01:26:37,030
Who's this?

1256
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:40,534
I'm a friend of his.
I'm in the coffee shop.

1257
01:26:40,534 --> 01:26:42,486
I think we better talk.

1258
01:26:42,486 --> 01:26:46,540
I'll be right down.

1259
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,542
## Get the phone
off the hook ##

1260
01:26:49,043 --> 01:26:50,545
## Turn out the light ##

1261
01:26:50,545 --> 01:26:55,550
## The Do Not Disturb
sign's hangin' tonight ##

1262
01:27:39,544 --> 01:27:42,130
I know he's with you, but there's
something you should know.

1263
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:47,970
Connie loves me and
he's going to marry me.

1264
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:50,938
He flew me down here,
he got me a room.

1265
01:27:50,938 --> 01:27:54,943
And when he didn't
show up, I just...

1266
01:27:55,477 --> 01:27:56,862
How long have you known him?

1267
01:27:56,862 --> 01:27:58,864
Four years.

1268
01:27:59,364 --> 01:28:03,786
We met when he was visiting
you in the hospital.

1269
01:28:04,285 --> 01:28:07,790
Right, you're a nurse, right?

1270
01:28:19,301 --> 01:28:21,170
What did you think was going on?

1271
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:24,256
What would he say to you?

1272
01:28:24,256 --> 01:28:27,509
He said you were
just working for him.

1273
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:35,851
We've been together seven years.

1274
01:28:35,851 --> 01:28:38,654
Well, what we have is special.

1275
01:28:38,654 --> 01:28:40,156
I know, he's told me.

1276
01:28:40,156 --> 01:28:43,660
I'm the number one most
important thing in his life.

1277
01:28:53,670 --> 01:28:55,839
Got a cigarette?

1278
01:29:02,262 --> 01:29:04,348
Ah, shit.

1279
01:29:09,019 --> 01:29:11,472
Baby?

1280
01:29:11,472 --> 01:29:15,526
You saw her, how could
it be anything serious?

1281
01:29:15,526 --> 01:29:18,529
She was very sweet
to me and, uh, I mean,

1282
01:29:18,529 --> 01:29:20,531
how could I
be a shithead to her?

1283
01:29:20,531 --> 01:29:22,032
It happened one time!

1284
01:29:22,032 --> 01:29:24,535
Honest, that's it.

1285
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:27,538
She...she...

1286
01:29:31,709 --> 01:29:33,711
I-I-I'm just trying
to let her down easy

1287
01:29:33,711 --> 01:29:35,796
and then she just keeps
following me around.

1288
01:29:35,796 --> 01:29:37,298
What am I supposed to do?

1289
01:29:37,298 --> 01:29:39,300
I love you.

1290
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:43,554
You are the number one most
important thing in my life.

1291
01:29:56,100 --> 01:30:00,187
[Man]
The Winston tools, emblematic
of the world championship,

1292
01:30:00,187 --> 01:30:03,190
as determined by the Winston
series points total...

1293
01:30:03,692 --> 01:30:08,196
goes this year to Shirley Muldowney.

1294
01:30:20,041 --> 01:30:23,595
Thank you.

1295
01:30:23,595 --> 01:30:29,100
I have to give special
thanks to Rahn and John...

1296
01:30:34,105 --> 01:30:38,110
who've done such a great
job for us all year.

1297
01:30:38,610 --> 01:30:42,615
And, uh, to our many sponsors.

1298
01:30:42,615 --> 01:30:47,620
And to the guys at N.H.R.A. who
organize these great events.

1299
01:30:50,573 --> 01:30:55,628
And to Jack Muldowney,
who built my first car.

1300
01:30:55,628 --> 01:31:00,634
And to Conrad Kalitta,
who built my best car.

1301
01:31:00,634 --> 01:31:04,637
And, of course, to all our fans
who've given us such great support.

1302
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:11,645
And to my father, who
always knew I could do it.

1303
01:31:16,649 --> 01:31:20,654
Connie Kalitta, Shirley's crew
chief, Connie, come up here.

1304
01:31:24,657 --> 01:31:27,160
There's, uh...

1305
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:29,663
There's really only one
person for me to thank.

1306
01:31:29,663 --> 01:31:33,116
Uh, and that's Shirley Muldowney,

1307
01:31:33,116 --> 01:31:38,121
who, uh, I've always said is the best
pure driver I've ever seen.

1308
01:31:40,623 --> 01:31:45,128
She deserves a lot of credit
for keeping the faith,

1309
01:31:45,629 --> 01:31:48,182
through a lot
of really hard times.

1310
01:31:48,182 --> 01:31:52,687
And, uh, I love her.

1311
01:31:52,687 --> 01:31:54,688
[clapping]

1312
01:31:57,191 --> 01:31:58,693
[Man]
Oh, I don't know, Connie.

1313
01:31:58,693 --> 01:32:01,695
You bring in a beautiful
woman like that to beat us.

1314
01:32:01,695 --> 01:32:02,696
Making us guys look bad.

1315
01:32:02,696 --> 01:32:04,197
[laughing]

1316
01:32:04,197 --> 01:32:07,201
[Connie]
Some of my best friends are women.

1317
01:32:07,201 --> 01:32:09,704
[Man]
Good thing you didn't
teach 'em all how to drive.

1318
01:32:09,704 --> 01:32:12,205
[Connie]
Hey, seriously,
Shirley is the best.

1319
01:32:12,707 --> 01:32:14,709
Driving. I'm talkin' about drivin'.

1320
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:38,900
[tapping]

1321
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:40,903
What the hell are you doin'?

1322
01:32:40,903 --> 01:32:43,689
You can forget that shit 'cause
I'm taking you out to dinner.

1323
01:32:44,188 --> 01:32:46,942
And I'm not talkin' pizza.
I'm talkin' escargot atChez Philip's.

1324
01:32:47,442 --> 01:32:49,745
I don't want to go anywhere with you.

1325
01:32:50,244 --> 01:32:51,864
Okay. Okay.

1326
01:32:51,864 --> 01:32:55,450
I was hopin' to do this by candle
light in some fancy restaraunt,

1327
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:58,287
but if this is the way you want it.
Merry Christmas.

1328
01:32:58,537 --> 01:33:01,123
Connie, don't.

1329
01:33:01,123 --> 01:33:03,125
Clark made it up special.

1330
01:33:03,125 --> 01:33:06,128
He owed me for a set of pistons.

1331
01:33:06,128 --> 01:33:09,015
Look, enough,
I don't want it.

1332
01:33:09,015 --> 01:33:10,766
Okay, I don't want
any presents from you.

1333
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:13,352
I don't want to go
out with you.

1334
01:33:13,352 --> 01:33:15,187
I don't want
anything from you.

1335
01:33:15,688 --> 01:33:17,689
What the hell's going on here?

1336
01:33:17,689 --> 01:33:20,192
First you call me for
an appointment like I'm

1337
01:33:20,192 --> 01:33:22,061
some kind of a damn
doctor or something.

1338
01:33:22,061 --> 01:33:25,564
Look, I've been going over our
records for the past seven years.

1339
01:33:25,564 --> 01:33:31,570
Now, um, seems like the top fuel operation
has pretty much evened itself out.

1340
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:35,407
There's still an outstanding debt left
over from our first funny car.

1341
01:33:35,742 --> 01:33:38,828
Something in the neighborhood
of about $1200.

1342
01:33:38,828 --> 01:33:41,246
What's all this about?

1343
01:33:41,748 --> 01:33:43,883
I just want to be fair
and get it over with.

1344
01:33:44,384 --> 01:33:47,087
Is that right?

1345
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:52,509
[door closing]

1346
01:33:54,561 --> 01:33:55,512
[door opening]

1347
01:33:55,512 --> 01:33:57,848
Okay, okay, listen, I know
I've been lousy to you.

1348
01:33:58,065 --> 01:34:00,683
But this crazy situation
of mine is gonna change.

1349
01:34:00,683 --> 01:34:02,519
You know that.
It's gonna change.

1350
01:34:02,519 --> 01:34:06,606
Look, I'm expecting a telephone
interview in a little while.

1351
01:34:07,108 --> 01:34:09,109
It's the radio.

1352
01:34:09,109 --> 01:34:13,029
And, uh, I'm making an announcement.

1353
01:34:13,029 --> 01:34:15,865
I've decided to race
the car without you, Connie.

1354
01:34:15,865 --> 01:34:17,701
Rahn and John are
gonna handle the car.

1355
01:34:17,701 --> 01:34:19,285
I'm gonna handle the money.

1356
01:34:19,787 --> 01:34:23,791
Just Rahn and John?

1357
01:34:23,791 --> 01:34:26,877
I can't afford to have
you in the picture.

1358
01:34:26,877 --> 01:34:30,347
It's that simple, right?

1359
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,443
[door closing]

1360
01:34:42,943 --> 01:34:45,946
[phone ringing]

1361
01:34:53,454 --> 01:34:54,406
Hello.

1362
01:34:54,406 --> 01:34:57,459
[Jack]
Hey. How you doin'?

1363
01:34:57,958 --> 01:34:59,460
It's Christmas time
and I finally said, uh,

1364
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:03,965
I get around to congratulate
you on winning that thing.

1365
01:35:03,965 --> 01:35:05,467
How ya doin', Jack?

1366
01:35:05,884 --> 01:35:08,969
I'm doin' fine.

1367
01:35:08,969 --> 01:35:11,389
How's John?
How's he doin'?

1368
01:35:11,389 --> 01:35:13,892
Aw, he's great.

1369
01:35:13,892 --> 01:35:16,311
He works for me
full time now, you know?

1370
01:35:16,311 --> 01:35:17,312
Full time, huh?

1371
01:35:17,812 --> 01:35:19,314
Yeah!

1372
01:35:19,314 --> 01:35:21,316
Well, you must
be doin' good, then.

1373
01:35:21,316 --> 01:35:22,351
Finally makin' that big money.

1374
01:35:22,351 --> 01:35:24,937
Well, I'm doin' a little better.

1375
01:35:25,403 --> 01:35:29,442
What about you?
What's going on with your station?

1376
01:35:29,941 --> 01:35:31,410
My station?
Station's okay.

1377
01:35:31,410 --> 01:35:33,945
With the way the gas prices have
been hiking up now,

1378
01:35:34,413 --> 01:35:37,949
could you believe that there is a
line around the place?

1379
01:35:37,949 --> 01:35:39,951
There was for a couple weeks.

1380
01:35:43,456 --> 01:35:46,459
Good thing I'm not
running gas anymore, huh?

1381
01:35:46,459 --> 01:35:48,760
Yeah. Yeah, uh...

1382
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:53,049
listen, Shirl, um...

1383
01:35:53,049 --> 01:35:54,550
you know, you and I never talked

1384
01:35:54,550 --> 01:35:58,354
about the things you took
when you left, you know?

1385
01:35:58,854 --> 01:35:59,689
Yeah.

1386
01:35:59,939 --> 01:36:04,527
Look, um...

1387
01:36:04,527 --> 01:36:07,531
I never bothered you when
you didn't have anything.

1388
01:36:07,531 --> 01:36:10,900
Now you got something, and I think
it's only fair we settle up, don't you?

1389
01:36:13,869 --> 01:36:16,373
Okay, Jack. I'll see
what I can do, okay?

1390
01:36:18,874 --> 01:36:20,877
Look, I gotta get
off the phone now.

1391
01:36:20,877 --> 01:36:21,877
I'm expecting
a radio interview.

1392
01:36:21,877 --> 01:36:23,880
I'm really sorry.
I can't tie up the line.

1393
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:26,250
It was just a bad time
for you to call.

1394
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:28,585
Okay. All right.

1395
01:36:31,088 --> 01:36:34,590
Could you, uh...tell John that I
wish him a real Merry Christmas,

1396
01:36:34,590 --> 01:36:35,892
you know, from his Dad.

1397
01:36:36,092 --> 01:36:39,680
I'll send him something if, you know...

1398
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,181
Merry Christmas, Jack.

1399
01:36:44,151 --> 01:36:45,602
Have a nice interview,
all right, Shirl?

1400
01:36:46,069 --> 01:36:48,021
Sure.

1401
01:37:11,345 --> 01:37:14,348
[rings]

1402
01:37:21,856 --> 01:37:23,358
Hello.
[Man]
Shirley Muldowney, please.

1403
01:37:23,858 --> 01:37:25,360
Yes, this is she.

1404
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:28,364
Oh, terrific, Shirley. Hey, I got
Muldowney, you can stop calling.

1405
01:37:28,364 --> 01:37:30,865
Listen, I'm Bob Morton, Sportsline,
my producer talked to you.

1406
01:37:30,865 --> 01:37:32,867
Yes, Bob. Your phone's been so goddamn busy,

1407
01:37:32,867 --> 01:37:34,869
I'm gonna have to wing this thing.

1408
01:37:34,869 --> 01:37:36,371
Listen, we're doing this end-of-the-year
sports wrap-up,

1409
01:37:36,371 --> 01:37:38,873
and I don't know doodly-squat
about whatever the hell it is

1410
01:37:38,873 --> 01:37:41,376
you do with those cars, so you
gotta carry me some, okay?

1411
01:37:41,876 --> 01:37:43,378
Sure.
Now, what is it you won?

1412
01:37:43,378 --> 01:37:44,879
Some kind of award
or something? What?

1413
01:37:44,879 --> 01:37:48,384
Yes. I hold the current N.H.R.A.
top fuel championship.

1414
01:37:48,384 --> 01:37:49,885
Okay, listen, here's
what's gonna happen.

1415
01:37:50,386 --> 01:37:52,888
I'm gonna read this little intro,
talk to you a while,

1416
01:37:52,888 --> 01:37:54,890
and I'm gonna ask if you have any regrets

1417
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:56,892
and you do a Christmas
sentiment thing, you got me?

1418
01:37:56,892 --> 01:37:58,893
Uh-huh, sure.
Okay.

1419
01:37:58,893 --> 01:38:00,896
I'm gonna come right out of
commercial, so stand by.

1420
01:38:00,896 --> 01:38:03,398
All right? Okay. Three,
two, one, okay. Hey, hi!

1421
01:38:03,398 --> 01:38:05,401
Bob Morton, Sportsline.
Our guest today is

1422
01:38:05,401 --> 01:38:07,903
Shirley Muldowney, a local
gal who has made it big.

1423
01:38:07,903 --> 01:38:10,406
She's the current N.H.R.A.
top fuel champion,

1424
01:38:10,406 --> 01:38:13,409
driving a car for the local favorite,
Connie "The Bounty Hunter" Kalitta.

1425
01:38:13,409 --> 01:38:15,411
Shirley, you there?
Yes, Bob.

1426
01:38:15,411 --> 01:38:19,415
Hey, congratulations on winning the N.H.R.A.
fuel championship of the world!

1427
01:38:19,415 --> 01:38:20,916
Thank you.
Hey, now, Shirley,

1428
01:38:20,916 --> 01:38:23,420
did it ever cross your mind when
you were playing with dolls

1429
01:38:23,919 --> 01:38:26,422
that you might someday be mixing it
up with the big boys?

1430
01:38:26,422 --> 01:38:28,924
Well, Bob, I've always
been very competitive.

1431
01:38:28,924 --> 01:38:30,926
Uh-huh.
And as you may or may not know,

1432
01:38:30,926 --> 01:38:35,431
this is a sport which
requires good coordination

1433
01:38:35,431 --> 01:38:38,434
and good reflexes, and I've always
been known as a fast leaver.

1434
01:38:38,434 --> 01:38:40,437
Uh-huh.
That means I get off the line fast.

1435
01:38:40,437 --> 01:38:43,440
Hey, don't get off the line
too fast with us, Shirley Muldowney.

1436
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:45,442
Hey, listen, I thought we
might get lucky and catch

1437
01:38:45,442 --> 01:38:46,943
your so-called partner
in crime, Connie Kalitta,

1438
01:38:47,444 --> 01:38:49,446
and get in a word
with him too, huh?

1439
01:38:49,446 --> 01:38:51,948
Uh, no.
We all know that Shirley and Connie

1440
01:38:51,948 --> 01:38:53,949
have a special relationship
on and off the track.

1441
01:38:54,451 --> 01:38:55,402
What do you say, Shirley?

1442
01:38:55,402 --> 01:38:56,953
No. Mr. Kalitta isn't here right now.

1443
01:38:56,953 --> 01:38:58,455
Oh, he's not there. That's a shame.

1444
01:38:58,455 --> 01:39:00,957
I wanted to ask him what kind
of special preparations

1445
01:39:00,957 --> 01:39:04,461
he had to put the car through so that a
gal like you could handle it

1446
01:39:04,461 --> 01:39:07,965
Look, Bob, if you think it's so easy
to handle one of these little cars,

1447
01:39:08,465 --> 01:39:12,470
putting out 2500 horses at 250 miles
an hour and a force of 3 Gs,

1448
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:15,973
maybe you'd like to come down to the track,
give it a whirl sometime?

1449
01:39:15,973 --> 01:39:17,475
Oh, no thanks, ma'am.
No thanks.

1450
01:39:17,974 --> 01:39:19,476
I'm happy right behind this here microphone.

1451
01:39:19,977 --> 01:39:23,264
Listen, Bob, I would like to say something
else at this time, if I might.

1452
01:39:23,514 --> 01:39:25,098
Hey, it's all yours, sweetheart.

1453
01:39:25,599 --> 01:39:28,602
It's all yours.
Take it away.

1454
01:39:28,602 --> 01:39:31,105
Beginning next year,

1455
01:39:31,105 --> 01:39:34,108
Connie Kalitta Flying Services
and Connie Kalitta

1456
01:39:34,108 --> 01:39:37,611
will no longer be associated
in any way, shape or form,

1457
01:39:37,611 --> 01:39:41,582
legally, professionally or otherwise,
with my racing team.

1458
01:39:42,116 --> 01:39:45,619
Yes. From now on, Rahn Tobler
will be my crew chief,

1459
01:39:45,619 --> 01:39:48,623
and he'll be working along
with John Muldowney, my son.

1460
01:39:48,623 --> 01:39:50,624
Hey, I think we have a scoop here!

1461
01:39:51,125 --> 01:39:55,129
Wow! Hey now, listen, Shirley, you've
got backers or sponsors,

1462
01:39:55,129 --> 01:39:56,630
you know, you people have
those things, right?

1463
01:39:57,131 --> 01:39:58,632
Do they know what's
coming down here?

1464
01:39:58,632 --> 01:40:01,635
Oh, yes. They are being
made aware of our position.

1465
01:40:01,635 --> 01:40:03,638
Hey. Well, good luck, Shirley.

1466
01:40:03,638 --> 01:40:06,140
You sound like one lady who knows
her way around a track.

1467
01:40:06,641 --> 01:40:10,145
But just one last question. When you
look back over your whole career,

1468
01:40:10,645 --> 01:40:12,646
do you have any regrets?

1469
01:40:12,646 --> 01:40:14,148
Yes, I do, but only one.

1470
01:40:14,148 --> 01:40:16,651
That my father couldn't live
to see me be champion.

1471
01:40:16,651 --> 01:40:18,653
Hey, that's great.

1472
01:40:18,653 --> 01:40:21,156
Thank you, Shirley Muldowney,
and a Merry Christmas to you!

1473
01:40:21,156 --> 01:40:23,158
Yes, well, Merry Christmas
to all my fans.

1474
01:40:23,158 --> 01:40:25,160
Oh, they love you, Shirley.

1475
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:27,662
Hey, we'll take your calls in a minute,
right after this commercial.

1476
01:40:27,662 --> 01:40:29,164
Shirley, thanks, that was pretty good.

1477
01:40:29,164 --> 01:40:30,632
[phone disconnects]

1481
01:41:00,947 --> 01:41:01,914
What do you think you're doing?

1482
01:41:02,198 --> 01:41:04,250
We ain't got nothing
to do with each other,

1483
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:05,785
legally, professionally,
or any other way.

1484
01:41:05,785 --> 01:41:07,787
Isn't that what you said?
I'm takin' my tools back.

1485
01:41:08,287 --> 01:41:09,288
What are you gonna do with 'em?

1486
01:41:09,789 --> 01:41:11,290
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

1487
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:12,291
I'm gonna get my license back

1488
01:41:12,758 --> 01:41:15,294
and I'm gonna build me
one hot mother of a car

1489
01:41:15,294 --> 01:41:18,764
that's got more horsepower in it
than anything you've ever seen.

1490
01:41:18,764 --> 01:41:22,301
Then I'm gonna kick your ass
across every track there is.

1491
01:41:22,518 --> 01:41:23,386
With who driving?

1492
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:26,306
Me!

1493
01:41:26,306 --> 01:41:28,724
Shirley, you're a great chauffeur,
but that just doesn't get it done.

1494
01:41:29,226 --> 01:41:30,226
Shit.

1495
01:41:30,611 --> 01:41:32,145
If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be getting

1496
01:41:32,696 --> 01:41:35,197
those damn speeding tickets in that
chicken-shit town I got you out of.

1497
01:41:35,197 --> 01:41:37,034
Why don't you give birth to me, too?

1498
01:41:37,284 --> 01:41:39,152
Gimme a break. You gonna
take credit for everything?

1499
01:41:39,369 --> 01:41:40,454
Just fine by me, baby.

1500
01:41:40,454 --> 01:41:42,456
You got what you wanted.
I made you famous.

1501
01:41:42,456 --> 01:41:44,458
Now I'm supposed to eat shit, right?
Is that it?

1502
01:41:44,875 --> 01:41:46,960
You're breakin' my heart.
Why don't you cry about it

1503
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:48,795
to one of those little chickies
you've been screwing?

1504
01:41:48,996 --> 01:41:51,081
Little miss virtue.

1505
01:41:51,081 --> 01:41:53,083
When your almighty
career was at stake,

1506
01:41:53,083 --> 01:41:54,501
you were just that quick

1507
01:41:54,801 --> 01:41:56,754
to dump Jack and jump into my bed.
Don't hit me.

1508
01:41:57,221 --> 01:41:58,256
Mom?

1509
01:42:01,642 --> 01:42:04,678
God damn it, you lunk,
let go of my Mom!

1510
01:42:04,678 --> 01:42:06,346
Get back--

1511
01:42:09,850 --> 01:42:10,735
God!

1512
01:42:14,939 --> 01:42:16,774
Ugh!

1513
01:42:31,956 --> 01:42:33,424
Ugh!

1514
01:42:36,628 --> 01:42:39,213
Bloody stop!

1515
01:42:39,213 --> 01:42:41,432
Ow!

1516
01:42:42,433 --> 01:42:44,802
Jesus!

1517
01:42:45,103 --> 01:42:47,188
[dogs barking]

1518
01:43:08,077 --> 01:43:09,995
[engine starts]

1519
01:43:14,883 --> 01:43:17,419
It's fine.

1520
01:43:32,434 --> 01:43:34,486
[door closes]

1521
01:43:39,192 --> 01:43:41,695
[Announcer]
It's almost time, here at O.C.I.R.,

1522
01:43:41,695 --> 01:43:43,196
for the final in top fuel,

1523
01:43:43,196 --> 01:43:45,198
pitting the Pink Dregs
with Shirley Muldowney

1524
01:43:45,198 --> 01:43:48,034
against the red and gold
Bounty Hunter of Connie Kalitta.

1525
01:43:48,284 --> 01:43:50,870
It's been three long years since
their well-publicized breakup,

1526
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:54,340
three years that must've seemed a
hopeless eternity for Shirley Muldowney.

1527
01:43:54,708 --> 01:43:57,210
After being shut out of
the winner's circle in '78,

1528
01:43:57,510 --> 01:44:00,096
achieving only limited
success in '79,

1529
01:44:00,096 --> 01:44:02,098
Shirley has had
a big year in '80,

1530
01:44:02,098 --> 01:44:04,551
winning the Winter Nationals,
the Spring Nationals,

1531
01:44:04,551 --> 01:44:06,102
and the Fall Nationals in Seattle.

1532
01:44:06,603 --> 01:44:09,105
If she takes the crown here,
Shirley will forever silence
Oh, shit.

1533
01:44:09,606 --> 01:44:13,860
all those critics who still think it
takes a man to race a car.

1534
01:44:17,481 --> 01:44:18,482
Hey, kid,

1535
01:44:18,815 --> 01:44:21,152
maybe you need some help
from a professional.

1536
01:44:21,368 --> 01:44:23,454
Hey, a little nervous over there?

1537
01:44:23,454 --> 01:44:26,657
[laughs]

1538
01:44:53,735 --> 01:44:54,653
[engine starts]

1539
01:45:03,828 --> 01:45:06,915
[audience cheering]

1540
01:45:33,776 --> 01:45:37,446
[Announcer]
This may well be the most
exciting top fuel final

1541
01:45:37,729 --> 01:45:40,565
in the history of this sport.
Shirley racing Connie.

1542
01:45:41,067 --> 01:45:43,401
For Shirley, it's a miracle
she's here at all.

1543
01:45:43,401 --> 01:45:45,872
Three years ago, when these two
broke up, the racing world said,

1544
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:50,326
"The lady is done. Without
Kalitta, she can't make it."

1545
01:45:50,326 --> 01:45:52,662
But in three short years,
with very little sponsorship,

1546
01:45:52,912 --> 01:45:56,582
hardly any money at all, a very young,
seemingly inexperienced crew,

1547
01:45:56,883 --> 01:46:00,385
Shirley Muldowney is back and has
a chance right now to win

1548
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:03,089
an unprecedented second
top fuel world title.

1549
01:46:03,089 --> 01:46:04,472
Ironic, isn't it?

1550
01:46:04,757 --> 01:46:07,643
Who should stand in her way?
Connie "The Bounty Hunter" Kalitta.

1551
01:46:12,232 --> 01:46:14,734
For Shirley, there's
a world title at stake.

1552
01:46:14,734 --> 01:46:17,236
For Kalitta, it's pride.
He doesn't need the money.

1553
01:46:17,236 --> 01:46:19,739
He hasn't been in a final
round in many, many years.

1554
01:46:20,156 --> 01:46:23,193
This is the first time that he and
Shirley have ever raced each other

1555
01:46:23,609 --> 01:46:24,995
side by side.

1556
01:46:25,195 --> 01:46:27,281
All those arguments
as to who would be best

1557
01:46:27,281 --> 01:46:29,867
will be settled right now.

1558
01:46:30,117 --> 01:46:33,203
[Announcer, on TV]
Shirley has made it
in a man's game.

1559
01:46:33,587 --> 01:46:35,171
They don't consider
her a woman now,

1560
01:46:35,171 --> 01:46:36,590
just another competitor.

1561
01:46:57,778 --> 01:46:58,362
It's Shirley!

1562
01:46:58,779 --> 01:46:59,781
[screaming]
She won!

1563
01:47:07,288 --> 01:47:08,823
[horn honking]

1564
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:11,541
[whooping]

1565
01:47:13,210 --> 01:47:14,745
[imitates choking]

1566
01:47:16,331 --> 01:47:17,381
[horn honking]
We did it!

1567
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:23,471
Out of the car--Excuse me, literally
besieged here by the foreign press,

1568
01:47:23,721 --> 01:47:25,673
it's the first major victory--

1569
01:47:28,009 --> 01:47:29,010
Whoo!

1570
01:47:34,515 --> 01:47:37,518
She's number one, this lady!
This lady has the magic touch!

1571
01:47:38,019 --> 01:47:39,604
[cheering]

1572
01:47:43,274 --> 01:47:44,776
Excuse me.

1573
01:47:44,776 --> 01:47:45,778
Excuse me.

1574
01:47:45,778 --> 01:47:47,279
Excuse me!

1575
01:47:52,617 --> 01:47:53,618
Good drag race.
Yeah.

1576
01:47:53,618 --> 01:47:55,537
Not bad. You oughta
do this for a living.

1577
01:47:55,955 --> 01:47:59,541
Oh, yeah?
Smoked your ass.

1578
01:48:00,042 --> 01:48:01,543
You had a good teacher, didn't you?

1579
01:48:12,054 --> 01:48:14,556
I'm gonna get you next year.

1580
01:48:14,556 --> 01:48:15,524
I'm not goin' anywhere.

1581
01:48:15,941 --> 01:48:17,526
I'll be here.

1582
01:48:17,526 --> 01:48:18,477
[John]
Whoo-wee!

1583
01:48:18,861 --> 01:48:19,945
Number one!
Whoo!

1584
01:48:19,945 --> 01:48:21,897
[Reporter]
Shirley, it was a really terrific run.

1585
01:48:22,231 --> 01:48:24,701
It's a thrill for all of us to watch you.

1586
01:48:24,984 --> 01:48:26,986
Not bad for an old broad
in a used car, huh?

1587
01:48:27,403 --> 01:48:32,124
That's Shirley Muldowney,
the only two-ti--

1588
01:48:42,918 --> 01:48:47,424
[crowd cheering]

1589
01:48:58,435 --> 01:49:02,439
## Sometimes love's not all
you want it to be ##

1590
01:49:05,442 --> 01:49:09,329
## And though you do
your best to make it last ##

1591
01:49:09,329 --> 01:49:13,867
## You can feel the magic
fading fast ##

1592
01:49:13,867 --> 01:49:18,371
## And love just seems
to roll away like a wheel ##

1593
01:49:21,875 --> 01:49:25,880
## So you remember ##

1594
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:29,382
## The tender years ##

1595
01:49:29,382 --> 01:49:32,887
## Collect your memories ##

1596
01:49:32,887 --> 01:49:37,391
## And pack up all your tears ##

1597
01:49:37,391 --> 01:49:40,394
## 'Cause you were born to win ##

1598
01:49:40,394 --> 01:49:43,898
## Love waits for you
to try again ##

1599
01:49:44,164 --> 01:49:49,169
## You only need to believe
inside your heart ##

1600
01:49:49,169 --> 01:49:52,138
## That you were born to win ##

1601
01:49:52,138 --> 01:49:55,676
## Time has come to begin again ##

1602
01:49:55,676 --> 01:50:01,648
## The way is clear and you've
known it from the start ##

1603
01:50:01,648 --> 01:50:05,186
## That you were born to win ##

1604
01:50:07,187 --> 01:50:11,692
## One by one the heartaches
all fade away ##

1605
01:50:14,695 --> 01:50:18,699
## And as you watch them
disappear at last ##

1606
01:50:18,699 --> 01:50:22,703
## You will know that you've
outrun the past and ##

1607
01:50:22,703 --> 01:50:27,208
## Realize why love
led you on this way ##

1608
01:50:30,711 --> 01:50:34,715
## And you remember ##

1609
01:50:34,715 --> 01:50:38,219
## Though dreams have forked ##

1610
01:50:38,219 --> 01:50:41,222
## Dreams are forever ##

1611
01:50:41,723 --> 01:50:44,225
## So tell yourself
once more ##

1612
01:50:46,193 --> 01:50:49,231
## That you were born to win ##

1613
01:50:49,231 --> 01:50:52,734

## The moment's waiting ##

1620
01:51:19,227 --> 01:51:24,267
## And you know it
won't be long ##

1621
01:51:24,267 --> 01:51:26,269
## You'll look around you ##

1622
01:51:26,768 --> 01:51:30,238
## And you'll see you're
standing strong ##
