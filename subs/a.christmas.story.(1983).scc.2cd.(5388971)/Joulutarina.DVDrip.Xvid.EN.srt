3
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,920
You all know who l am.

4
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,680
We meet once a year,
on Christmas Eve.

5
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,080
But children and adults,
young and old:

6
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,280
l, too, have been a child.
You don't believe it?

7
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,000
Let me tell you a story.

8
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:17,400
CHRISTMAS STORY

9
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,600
NikoIas... Dear NikoIas.

10
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,600
Aada has a high fever. We'II have to
take her to the viIIage.

11
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,080
The firewood shouId Iast
untiI we return.

12
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:55,280
We'II be back when the IittIe hand
and the big hand are Iike that.

13
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,280
We'II save time by
taking a shortcut through the ice.

14
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,400
NikoIas, you can finish Aada's
present whiIe waiting. Right?

15
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,680
Where did you get the idea
of giving presents at Christmas?

16
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,880
AIthough it's a nice idea.

17
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,080
NikoIas, we found your parents'
tracks on the ice.

18
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,480
The tracks Iead straight
into open water.

19
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,880
I'm so sorry.

20
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,800
Nobody wants to see an orphaned boy
starve or freeze to death.

21
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,680
Of course not.
-We aIready have three chiIdren.

22
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,480
It's the same thing with everybody.

23
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,480
Fishermen's wives know how hard it
is to make a Iiving. And NikoIas...

24
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,080
Why don't you cast him
into the Iake with his famiIy?

25
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,000
I can do that,
if none of you is man enough.

26
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,480
He scurried off. The IittIe runt
has no sense of humour.

27
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
I have an idea.

28
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,400
Kristiina and I
can take care of him for a whiIe.

29
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,000
I've had fisherman's Iuck IateIy.
We have some savings.

30
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,000
I beIieve that we can feed an extra
mouth. At Ieast through the winter.

31
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,880
I think that the whoIe viIIage
shouId take care of the boy.

32
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,280
How many househoIds
do we have here?

33
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,600
Four, five, six.

34
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,480
Each househoId shaII take
care of the boy for a year -

35
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,680
and then send him to the next house.

36
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,480
I think that we can manage that.

37
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,280
I'm not going to take part
in that nonsense.

38
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,680
You don't Iive here, Iisakki.
It's not of your concern.

39
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Quit your yapping.

40
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,600
We'II aII take care of NikoIas.

41
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,280
Beginning with the Hannuses.

42
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,400
The boy wiII move to the next famiIy
on Christmas.

43
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,400
Is this agreed?
-Yes.

44
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,880
Good.

45
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,680
Merry Christmas, sister Aada.

46
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,680
l could not forget
my mother and my father -

47
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,000
and my sister Aada.

48
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,680
l knew they would not be
coming back -

49
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,600
but l missed them dearly.

50
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,000
Thank you.

51
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
But time heals the wounds -

52
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,880
and by autumn
the sadness began to fade away.

53
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,480
My boat's broken. Fix it.
-Ask your father.

54
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,080
My father has gone fishing.
-Ask your mother, then.

55
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,680
Mother can't do it.
-Give it to me.

56
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,280
Turn, boat!
-It won't turn!

57
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,800
Why doesn't it come here?
Turn right!

58
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,280
There it goes!

59
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,000
l didn't know it back then -

60
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,080
but Eemeli would become
a good friend. My best friend.

61
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,000
Good throw.
It bounced off the water.

62
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,200
I found a great stone.
-Stretch your arm back and throw.

63
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,680
You can do it.
One, two, three!

64
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,400
Let's get another one.

65
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,280
Then came the moment
l had been dreading.

66
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,200
l had to move to another
family for the very first time.

67
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,280
Are you sure
you'II find your way to the Heinos?

68
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,280
Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

69
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,600
Years, families and Christmases
came and went.

70
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,600
Every Christmas l carved Presents -

71
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,080
for the children
of my former families.

72
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,080
As the years Passed,
there were so many of them -

73
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:35,200
that l had to deliver the Presents
to their front doors at night.

74
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,080
lt suited me fine -

75
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,880
because l didn't want to make
a great fuss about it.

76
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,200
lnstead, l acted ignorant -

77
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:50,080
if someone came to thank me
after Christmas.

78
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,480
On my sixth year,
not everything went as Planned.

79
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,480
That year was hard
for the whole village.

80
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,480
Early frost wiPed out
almost the entire croP.

81
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,600
lt was like the lake
was emPty of fish that year.

82
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,600
No fish today either?
-That's right, HiIIa.

83
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,880
That's a pity.

84
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,880
IF things didn't turn
for the better -

85
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,600
no family would be able
to house me for the winter.

86
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,000
EemeIi? What is it?

87
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,000
It's Mad Iisakki. Run away!

88
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,480
Get your homes in shipshape
for Christmas!

89
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,080
Scoops, IadIes, cups!

90
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,480
SpatuIas, tubs and potato mashers!
I have everything you need here!

91
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,600
And if I don't have it,
it can be made to order!

92
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,000
Boy, come here.

93
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,880
You haven't bought this from me.

94
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,480
Are you buying things from other
carpenters instead of Iisakki?

95
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,080
A bad year. We have no money.
We can bareIy feed ourseIves.

96
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,680
Where did you buy this?
Answer me!

97
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,000
I made it myseIf.
-Don't Iie, whippersnapper.

98
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And whose boy are you?
-Nobody's.

99
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:04,600
Oh yeah, you're the poor deviI who
is going around from house to house.

100
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,000
Where are the others?
-At the viIIage meeting.

101
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,400
What is so important
that they must have a meeting?

102
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,280
They're deciding what to do with me.
They can't afford me.

103
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,480
No wonder.
You must be such a gIutton -

104
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,800
that you have ruined the viIIage.
And now I can't seII anything.

105
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,400
You shouId've been cast
into the Iake. Get Iost!

106
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:46,080
But why? You don't Iike chiIdren.
-He can heIp me at work.

107
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,880
We know you, Iisakki.

108
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,680
I was pIanning to shape that brat
into a man within a year -

109
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,280
but if my offer isn't good enough
for you, there's nothing I can do.

110
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,680
Wait, Iisakki.

111
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,800
Maybe...
Maybe we shouId consider it.

112
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,080
There's nothing to consider.
He'II be better off with me -

113
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,080
than starving to death
here in this poor viIIage. Right?

114
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,680
This might be the Iast time
I can visit you.

115
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,480
Iisakki Iives so far away.

116
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,880
Merry Christmas, IittIe Aada.

117
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,800
NikoIas, come and see!

118
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,600
NikoIas.

119
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,880
It's been six years since
you were orphaned and came to us.

120
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:40,000
At first I was sorry that we
couIdn't find you a famiIy -

121
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,680
to take you in.

122
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,080
You had to go around from househoId
to househoId, one year at a time.

123
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,600
But now I beIieve that none of us
have regretted it.

124
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,680
We aII have gotten to know you.

125
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,080
And so, in a way,
you are our chiId.

126
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,480
And our brother.

127
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,680
On behaIf of aII the viIIagers,
especiaIIy the chiIdren -

128
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,000
we want to give you
a IittIe memento.

129
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,800
I can't...
-Of course you can.

130
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,480
The sIedge beIongs to you.

131
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,480
Are you stiII Ioafing about?
Get in the sIeigh.

132
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,600
Or you can waIk the whoIe way.

133
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,800
You're not going to cry, are you?

134
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,400
HiIma, trot aIong home
before night faIIs.

135
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What are you gawking at?
Take HiIma into the staII.

136
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,600
I'II go inside and Iight the stove.

137
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,000
And Ieave this sIedge in the staII.

138
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,080
No mucking about here.
You came here to work. Get up!

139
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,400
And you sIeep there.
-But...

140
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,600
No buts!
Did you forget whose house this is?

141
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,000
And you wiII caII me master.
-Yes.

142
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,080
What?
-Yes, master.

143
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Good. Your name is Brat.

144
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,080
It suits you better than NikoIas.
Take your bags in there. Move it!

145
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,480
Wake up, Brat. Get to work.

146
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:54,480
Let's get to the workshop.
You go on ahead.

147
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,800
Where's the workshop?
-You're standing on it.

148
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,480
What do you think?

149
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,080
Take a Iook at this dresser.

150
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,880
The secret is in the wooden inIays.

151
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,880
It's made of mapIe.
This is how I make money.

152
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,680
Scoops and IadIes
are chiId's pIay compared to this.

153
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,880
These wiII go to parsons, gentIeman
farmers and other weaIthy peopIe.

154
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,800
This wiII go to a judge.
-Is this chair going there too?

155
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,680
It's made of pine,
this is made of mapIe.

156
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,880
Don't you recognise timber species?

157
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,880
Maybe I made a mistake.
You're no good as a carpenter.

158
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,280
You haven't made a mistake, master.
I'm a quick Iearner.

159
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,880
A quick Iearner, eh? Let's see
how quickIy you Iearn to tidy up.

160
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,200
Get on with it.

161
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,400
Where are you going?
-Upstairs.

162
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,880
You don't need to go upstairs
to tidy up the workshop.

163
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,800
There's no need to cIean up here...

164
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,880
The workbench is covered with dust.

165
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,400
If it gets mixed with varnish or
stain, the whoIe work is ruined.

166
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,080
Lesson number one:

167
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,080
The workshop wiII be kept tidy
at aII times, no matter what.

168
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,400
Lesson number two:
Hand me your sheath-knife.

169
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,600
You don't use this on my timber.

170
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,400
Don't!
-What?

171
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,080
It was my father's.

172
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,080
Take a decent sheath-knife
from there.

173
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,280
Go to bed.

174
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,400
Remember to snuff out the candIes.

175
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,280
Why?
-It has no branches.

176
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,880
How can I find my things now?

177
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,080
Master...

178
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,680
A year has passed
and I have to go soon -

179
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,800
so I thought that I wouId
thank aII the viIIagers.

180
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,080
Maybe I couId take a day off?
-No.

181
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,200
When time is pressing -

182
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,800
you don't waste time thinking,
you work harder.

183
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,280
A day off, eh?

184
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,800
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you in bed?

185
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:37,000
Have you stoIen timber from me?
-You threw it away, master.

186
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,680
So this is what you do
behind my back.

187
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,880
I'm sorry, master.

188
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,600
It isn't badIy broken.

189
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,600
Bring me the wood driII
and a headIess naiI.

190
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:09,280
Why are you working in the dark?
It onIy resuIts in duds and rejects.

191
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,680
There.

192
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,680
Now you can't teII it's broken.

193
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,600
You have more toys
somewhere, right?

194
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,400
You must reaIIy Iike
those IittIe brats.

195
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,600
Did you pIan to sIip out
to deIiver presents -

196
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:58,280
because I didn't give you a day off?
That's what I thought.

197
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,480
Go on then -

198
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,200
but remember
to return before sunrise.

199
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,200
We don't idIe away,
even though it's Christmas.

200
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,080
Master...
-Not a word. I may change my mind.

201
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,800
You can buiId your toys
in the evenings.

202
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I might even heIp you.
At Ieast now I can get some sIeep.

203
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,600
BuiIding toys in the middIe
of the night... Humbug!

204
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:02,880
FinaIIy you showed up. I thought
you had gone into hibernation.

205
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,880
I aIready put your junk
in the sIeigh.

206
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,280
What are you gawking at?

207
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,600
You wouIdn't have made it back
before sunrise.

208
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,680
The Iast workday wouId
have gone to waste. Hop in.

209
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,880
Let's go.

210
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,880
That was the Iast house.
-This is fooIishness.

211
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,480
I can understand why you do this,
but an oId man Iike me...

212
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,880
Let's go home.
-There's one more pIace.

213
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,680
HoId on. Show me that.

214
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,400
I made a horse Iike this
when the boys were young.

215
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,480
What boys?

216
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:23,480
I had two boys, Hermanni and Henrik.

217
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:31,880
And a wife, Marget. She died when
the boys were about your age.

218
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Then they went to sea
and Ieft me aII aIone -

219
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,880
because I had become Iike this.

220
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,080
I see Henrik and Hermanni
in aII chiIdren.

221
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,480
That's why I'm mean
to chiIdren.

222
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,400
I stiII miss my boys.

223
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,880
What I mean to say is...
You couId stay with me.

224
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,280
Merry Christmas, NikoIas.

225
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,680
My father's sheath-knife.
Thank you, master.

226
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,480
From now on you can caII me Iisakki.

227
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,600
Merry Christmas, Aada.
-Merry Christmas, Aada.

228
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:00,600
Merry Christmas, Iisakki.
-Merry Christmas, NikoIas.

229
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,800
That's enough. Let's go.

230
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,880
That Christmas changed everything.
The village overcame the bad years.

231
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,280
My vagabond life was over.

232
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,200
lisakki Provided me a home
that l didn't have to give uP.

233
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,080
Thank you very much.
Good day to you.

234
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,000
Hurry up!

235
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,800
Good day to you.

236
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,680
Come and buy a dresser!

237
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,600
The years with lisakki
Passed quickly.

238
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:02,000
Before l knew it, l was all
grown uP, with a beard and all.

239
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:31,800
The village had grown.
There were so many new children -

240
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,680
that me and lisakki
could not keeP count.

241
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,080
But we had a secret helPer.

242
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,880
NikoIas.
-EemeIi.

243
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,000
Long time no see.
You shouId come more often.

244
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,400
I've been busy.
Iisakki is no Ionger young.

245
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,200
Do you have the Iist?

246
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,280
WeII, I'II be...
So many new chiIdren.

247
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,600
As a matter of fact, one name is
missing from that Iist. EIsa?

248
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Is that...
-A girI, three months.

249
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,400
Let's add her to the Iist.

250
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,480
What is the name
of this IittIe princess?

251
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,280
Aada.

252
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,800
Aada?

253
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,680
HeIIo, Aada.

254
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:56,280
NikoIas, meet Henrik and Hermanni.

255
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,480
My sons.

256
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,000
I sought them out
and asked them here.

257
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,800
Yes...

258
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,800
We were wrong when we...

259
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,680
We want to make it up
to our father.

260
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:24,880
We came to take him to Iive with us.
-To Iive with you? Where?

261
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:30,800
Away from here. Father is too oId
to be Iiving in arctic conditions.

262
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,600
What about me?

263
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,680
You'II get the house and
the workshop. You've earned them.

264
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,080
Wait, NikoIas.

265
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,280
NikoIas...

266
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,880
NikoIas, try to understand.

267
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,400
Even though I Iove you
Iike my own son...

268
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,680
This key opens the chest
under my bed.

269
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,000
I've aIways been skimpy,
maybe too much so.

270
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,680
I think you can do better.

271
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,480
Try to understand.

272
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,480
Try to understand.

273
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,280
NikoIas.

274
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,880
EemeIi.
-NikoIas.

275
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,080
HeIIo.
-HeIIo.

276
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,680
Where have you been?
-Here.

277
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,280
Here! But everything is unfinished.

278
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,680
These shouId Iast for ten years.

279
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,680
This is bareIy enough
for next Christmas.

280
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,600
What is that?
-A map.

281
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,680
There, there... To this remote
viIIage, to these houses.

282
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,400
There, there, there, there, there...
Christmas presents.

283
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,480
Christmas presents?
-Yes.

284
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,400
So many viIIages and chiIdren.
How do you know who'II get what?

285
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,680
There's a simpIe way.
-What is it?

286
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,280
I shaII write names on the wrapping.

287
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,480
Wrapping?
-Ingenious, isn't it?

288
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,680
How is aII this possibIe?

289
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,000
Iisakki's Iife savings.

290
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,400
Now I can bring Christmas cheer
to the chiIdren.

291
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,280
Nobody can Iive just for Christmas.

292
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:30,200
I've been seIfish. I've onIy brought
presents to those -

293
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,080
who have heIped me.
-SeIfish?

294
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,680
From now on, I'm going to appear
onIy on Christmas Eve. -NikoIas!

295
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,880
I'II visit your shop once a year -

296
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,600
to repIenish my suppIies and
to get a Iist of new chiIdren.

297
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,800
There's more to Iife
than just Christmas.

298
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,680
Like what?
-It's an impossibIe task.

299
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,400
You don't have room
for aII those presents.

300
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,800
And HiIma won't be abIe
to puII the Ioad.

301
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,200
It can't be done.
-Yes, it can.

302
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,080
Christmas is around the corner.
-AnimaIs are quick to Iearn.

303
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,880
Reindeer are not horses.
-HiIIa, this is chiId's pIay.

304
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,800
I can handIe reindeer, dear.
''Reindeer, dear.''

305
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,880
You can try.

306
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,480
Reindeer obey me better when
I'm wearing this coIourfuI cap.

307
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,800
Even the squirreIs are afraid of
such a garish coIour.

308
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,600
Reindeer wouId obey me even
if I had a pothoIder on my head.

309
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,480
I don't need any red caps.

310
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,480
Okay, faII in Iine.
Put your antIers down.

311
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,600
Come to NikoIas, chop-chop.

312
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,600
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer and BIitzen,
your training begins.

313
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,680
The first Iesson... Lassoing.
Dancer, behave yourseIf.

314
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,680
Sit there!

315
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,600
Sit! Sit! Stay!

316
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:21,800
Dasher, if you don't behave,
NikoIas wiII catch you! Prancer!

317
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,400
Let's try again.

318
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,680
HoId it!

319
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,080
Dancer! Prancer!

320
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,880
A red cap, a red coat...
And frieze trousers to boot.

321
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,680
What was the coIour?
-Red.

322
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,080
CouId you repeat that?

323
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,600
Red!

324
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,200
AII right.

325
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,000
I'II show you.

326
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,200
Let's see, Aada.
What do you have there?

327
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,680
A spinning top.
-That's nice.

328
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,200
ln a few years
the mysterious Present-bearer -

329
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,880
became the staPle
of children's stories.

330
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,400
Some swore to have seen elves
bringing Presents at Christmas.

331
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,480
Others claimed that the Presents
were from a child-friendly gnome.

332
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,000
Luckily, they didn't susPect me.

333
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,080
NikoIas is coming!
-Run away!

334
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,000
Good day.

335
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,200
HeIIo, Aada.

336
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,800
Where are the others?
-They are afraid of you.

337
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,680
Me? Why?

338
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,480
Mikko said that it's not you who
brings us presents at Christmas.

339
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:40,680
That you hate chiIdren. Is it true?
-Mikko is haIf right.

340
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,880
I don't bring presents.
But I don't hate chiIdren, either.

341
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,800
Who brings the presents?

342
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,000
Who knows?

343
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,680
Who knows?

344
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,880
NikoIas toId me when I asked him.

345
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,880
Aada cIaims that you don't
bring us presents.

346
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,880
Aada is right.

347
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,680
Aada!

348
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,080
Why did you say so?
TeII her the truth.

349
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,280
No way. ChiIdren must not
associate me with the presents.

350
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,000
It wouId ruin everything.
-Why is that?

351
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,680
One day you'II understand.

352
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,880
NikoIas!
-EemeIi?

353
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,400
Is Aada here?
-No.

354
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,080
Aada has gone missing.
-When?

355
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,800
''Dear mother and father.
Don't worry. I went to find out -

356
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,880
who brings aII the presents.''

357
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,680
We have to wake everybody up
and arrange a search party.

358
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,800
You must Iend me some cIothes.
Otherwise I'II be exposed.

359
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,280
Okay, boys. Hurry on home.

360
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,600
Let's form groups of two. A torch
and a Iantern for each group.

361
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,880
Aada couIdn't have gone far.
Let's hurry.

362
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,000
I know where she is.
-What did you say, Mikko?

363
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,800
Aada wants to deIiver you a present.

364
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:48,000
Me? Why? -Aada doesn't beIieve
that you don't bring us presents.

365
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,080
Why didn't you teII us earIier?
-I promised not to teII.

366
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,080
WiII Aada return?

367
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,400
Aada!

368
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,880
Aada!

369
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,280
Aada doesn't know where you Iive.
And even if she knew -

370
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,000
she won't be abIe to waIk that far.
Aada!

371
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,280
Aada!

372
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,480
NikoIas?
-Aada!

373
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,400
Nobody thought that you'd manage
to get this far.

374
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,680
TweIve miIes in a bIizzard.
How is it possibIe?

375
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,600
It was nothing on a reindeer sIeigh.
-A reindeer sIeigh?

376
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,680
What reindeer sIeigh?
-SuddenIy, a sIeigh appeared.

377
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,480
I thought it was you but the sIeigh
was empty... WeII, not quite.

378
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,680
I was coId so I put on your cIothes.
Then the reindeer brought me here.

379
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:31,280
l told Aada everything.
How l'd become the way l am -

380
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,000
and why it was so imPortant
to deliver Presents at Christmas.

381
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:43,000
l even revealed my dream
of continuing this tradition -

382
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,600
when l would be gone.

383
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,680
What kind of girI wouId Aada be now
if she hadn't become a water nymph?

384
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,480
HopefuIIy she'd be Iike you.

385
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,880
Merry Christmas, Aada.
-Merry Christmas, Aada.

386
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:14,080
Merry Christmas, Aada.
-Merry Christmas, NikoIas.

387
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,480
Aada kePt her Promise.

388
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,800
She didn't reveal my secret.
Quite the oPPosite.

389
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:01,480
He didn't Iook Iike NikoIas.
He was a wrinkIy oId man -

390
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,280
who caIIed himseIf Christmas Codger.

391
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:15,600
The years Passed,
and before l knew it -

392
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,200
my friendshiP with Aada
had lasted almost twenty years.

393
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,880
NikoIas!

394
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,880
WeII?
-I'm getting married.

395
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,880
To Mikko?

396
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:11,080
NikoIas, wiII you pick me up
on Christmas morning?

397
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,680
Of course I wiII.

398
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,800
HeIIo.
-HeIIo.

399
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,400
Thank you.
-For what?

400
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,000
For everything.

401
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,600
Everything.

402
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,600
My father is dead.

403
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:16,600
Fear of Iosing Iove is part of Iove.
It's part of Iife.

404
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,880
Your father...
EemeIi taught me that.

405
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,680
You have taught me
how wonderfuI it is to give.

406
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,800
Me?

407
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:44,400
NikoIas, maybe you shouId
think of yourseIf for a change.

408
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,480
Nothing Iasts forever.

409
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,280
lt was time for me
to give in to my years.

410
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:37,200
Next Christmas would be the last.
My last Christmas.

411
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,600
It's beautifuI. Who is it for?

412
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:02,680
Can I gift wrap it?
-No. I want to do it myseIf.

413
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,000
See you on Christmas morning.

414
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,600
Are you sure you don't
want any heIp at Christmas?

415
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,080
Yes. I want to do my rounds aIone.

416
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:38,480
NikoIas, remember your promise.
This is the Iast Christmas.

417
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,200
This is the Iast Christmas.

418
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,880
NikoIas?

419
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,200
NikoIas?

420
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:10,800
''Merry Christmas to IittIe Aada.
Your brother, NikoIas.''

421
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:33,600
''Merry Christmas to IittIe Aada.
Your brother, NikoIas.''

422
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:38,680
What is the meaning of this?
-We won't be seeing NikoIas again.

423
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:45,480
What do you mean?
-I can't expIain. I just know it.

424
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:12,800
What are you doing?
There's no sense in doing that.

425
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,680
NikoIas wanted this to continue.
-No.

426
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,280
A present for our NikoIas
wiII disappoint other chiIdren.

427
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:24,080
Other fathers have done this too...
-It's not the same thing.

428
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:28,680
Mikko, that's cheating.

429
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,400
Mikko?

430
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,480
Merry Christmas, IittIe Aada.

431
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:35,280
Merry Christmas, NikoIas.

432
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:52,480
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer and
BIitzen, ahoy!

433
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,000
Merry Christmas!
