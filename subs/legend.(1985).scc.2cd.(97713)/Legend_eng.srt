2
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,766
I am the lord of darkness.

3
00:02:18,835 --> 00:02:24,501
I require the solace
of the shadows...

4
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:28,534
and the dark of the night.

5
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,913
Sunshine is my destroyer.

6
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:40,554
All this shall change.

7
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:47,223
Tonight, the sun sets forever.

8
00:02:49,132 --> 00:02:53,466
There shall never be
another dawn...

9
00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:57,405
Enter!

10
00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:11,687
Ah, Blix.

11
00:03:12,368 --> 00:03:14,622
Come closer.

12
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:20,322
You summoned me, lordship?

13
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:25,560
Are you not the most loathsome
of my goblins?

14
00:03:25,636 --> 00:03:29,367
Truly, master.

15
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,001
And is your heart black
and full of hate?

16
00:03:34,077 --> 00:03:37,205
Black as midnight,
black as pitch,

17
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:39,511
blacker than
the foulest witch.

18
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,279
That is why
I have called you here.

19
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:46,982
Since I must remain in darkness,
you shall be my eyes and ears.

20
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:49,958
You do me
great honor, lord.

21
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:55,430
Something troubles me.

22
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:58,400
I feel a presence
in the forest,

23
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:03,497
a force I had mercifully
almost forgotten.

24
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:06,940
Must be dread, indeed,
to trouble you, lordship.

25
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,945
Looking upon
these frail creatures,

26
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:13,505
one would not think that
they could contain such power.

27
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:17,280
One could rule
the universe with it.

28
00:04:17,354 --> 00:04:22,553
You must find them for me
and destroy them!

29
00:04:22,626 --> 00:04:27,427
What do they look like, lord?

30
00:04:27,497 --> 00:04:31,957
Fool! Let this
serve to remind you.

31
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:35,095
They are each crowned
with a single horn...

32
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:37,800
reaching straight
to heaven.

33
00:04:37,874 --> 00:04:40,502
I get the point, lord.

34
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:43,478
Bring the horns to me.

35
00:04:43,547 --> 00:04:45,674
You will be well rewarded.

36
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:49,241
You shall be a prince
here in my realm.

37
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:52,152
A rare privilege, master.

38
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:57,660
Where shall I look, sire?

39
00:04:57,728 --> 00:05:02,597
There is only one lure
for such disgusting goodness.

40
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,931
One bait that never fails.

41
00:05:06,002 --> 00:05:09,494
What be this bait?
Please, you teach me.

42
00:05:09,573 --> 00:05:13,600
Innocence. Innocence.

43
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,770
<i>Come, white flowers</i>

44
00:05:45,842 --> 00:05:48,640
<i>Weave us a carpet</i>

45
00:05:48,712 --> 00:05:50,839
<i>Spreading oak</i>

46
00:05:50,914 --> 00:05:54,077
<i>Make a shade where we lie</i>

47
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:59,316
<i>Leaves and branches
whisper our love song</i>

48
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:04,759
<i>When I look
in my true love's eyes</i>

49
00:06:04,828 --> 00:06:09,765
<i>Young as any spring</i>

50
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:14,497
<i>His eyes almost sing</i>

51
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:18,200
<i>To me</i>

52
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,143
Blooming fairies!

53
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,150
Lily!

54
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:16,283
God bless, Your Highness.

55
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:19,089
A royal visit's
always a pleasure.

56
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:21,392
Have another biscuit.

57
00:08:28,905 --> 00:08:31,373
Nell...

58
00:08:33,243 --> 00:08:35,507
I have no time to stay
for a visit today.

59
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:37,570
You've got
a sweetheart waiting?

60
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:42,277
No, I don't.
Surely, your father
forbids such folly.

61
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:45,287
What my father doesn't know
won't trouble him.

62
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:48,449
Oh, the willful heart
invites despair,

63
00:08:48,525 --> 00:08:51,323
like blind men creeping
in a dragon's lair.

64
00:08:51,394 --> 00:08:53,760
Not a country proverb
nor king's command...

65
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,195
could keep me
from the woods today.

66
00:08:55,265 --> 00:09:01,602
Then it's common sense sort.
Lily. Princess Lily.

67
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:06,335
I look on you as a daughter.
If you'll pardon my saying it,

68
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:10,175
it's time you started behaving
like the princess you are.

69
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:13,943
You should be out looking for a handsome
prince on a white charger,

70
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:16,713
not visiting
poor folk like us.

71
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:21,917
No. Don't you know
I love coming here?

72
00:09:26,796 --> 00:09:29,629
This place holds
more magic for me...

73
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:31,963
than any palace
in the world.

74
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:35,562
You live a very rich
life, Nell.

75
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,971
I don't know of a prince
who could carve wood like this.

76
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,737
You're very sweet, Lily.

77
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:46,949
Magic is a wonderful thing.

78
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:49,952
You'll find your own magic
one day.

79
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,284
I'm sure you will.

80
00:09:53,657 --> 00:09:56,922
I have no time for this.
I'm going.

81
00:10:01,197 --> 00:10:03,961
Oh, and you look out
for spriggen and banshee,
my girl.

82
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:06,093
These woods
be thick with them.

83
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:10,162
Stay clear of toadstool
rings and willow trees...

84
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,504
and old oaks.

85
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:14,509
Jack!

86
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:18,408
Where are you?

87
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:24,252
Jack!

88
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:36,488
Jack! Jack!

89
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,032
Jack?

90
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,453
Jack?

91
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,217
Jack, answer me.

92
00:11:15,872 --> 00:11:18,739
Jack! Jack!

93
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:20,742
Jack.

94
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,682
Jack, please.
Please, if you're here,

95
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,776
say something to me, please.

96
00:11:31,221 --> 00:11:35,157
Jack, you scared
the life out of me!

97
00:11:46,503 --> 00:11:48,130
You're so clever.

98
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,200
Oh, here.

99
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:55,540
Whoops. Look inside.
See what you can find.

100
00:12:00,316 --> 00:12:02,841
That's something to eat.

101
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:07,279
I made that for you myself.

102
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:16,659
Well, I-I took it from Nell.

103
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:20,897
Do you like it? ls it sweet?

104
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:29,176
I know someone sweeter.

105
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:31,941
May be innocent,
may be sweet...

106
00:12:32,015 --> 00:12:36,281
ain't half as nice
as rotting meat.

107
00:12:52,402 --> 00:12:56,839
Good. Very good.
Just right.

108
00:12:58,174 --> 00:13:01,769
Jack, now teach me rabbit
like you promised.

109
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:03,779
Rabbit?

110
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:08,515
It's much harder
than finch.
Let me try.

111
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:12,817
I'm a good student,
and my father says
I'm brilliant.

112
00:13:14,657 --> 00:13:17,490
See how brilliant I am?

113
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,358
Let me dazzle you
with my wisdom.

114
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,831
It's much more than wisdom
that dazzles me, Lily.

115
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,804
Jack, teach me rabbit.

116
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:30,965
Not today.

117
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,974
Why not?

118
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:35,306
Because...

119
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:42,416
there's something
really special that I've
been promising to show you.

120
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,180
-Jack, do you mean it?
- Only if it pleases you, Lily.

121
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:50,420
It pleases me
more than anything.

122
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:52,825
We must go now...

123
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:56,024
because they'll only be here
for a short while.

124
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,768
Don't you trust me?

125
00:14:05,842 --> 00:14:08,367
I trust you, Lily.

126
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,607
Oh, Jack.

127
00:17:14,363 --> 00:17:17,890
Look! Ugly
one-horned mules.

128
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:30,704
Nothing is more magical.

129
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:35,774
As long as they roam
the earth,

130
00:17:35,852 --> 00:17:38,719
evil can never harm
the pure of heart.

131
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:56,004
Do you speak
their language?

132
00:17:57,607 --> 00:18:00,838
They express
only love and laughter.

133
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,344
Dark thoughts
are unknown to them.

134
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:09,747
No! No.

135
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:20,356
Please.

136
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:47,349
Lily, no, please!

137
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:12,137
<i>Come dance, sparrow</i>

138
00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:14,740
<i>Sing me good morning</i>

139
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:16,944
<i>Rise up, sun</i>

140
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:19,613
<i>Like the arch of the sky</i>

141
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:27,286
You'll spook the beast
and spoil the trap.

142
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:56,146
<i>Living river</i>

143
00:20:56,218 --> 00:20:59,676
<i>Turn the light to diamonds</i>

144
00:20:59,755 --> 00:21:04,454
<i>When I look
in my true love's eyes</i>

145
00:21:04,527 --> 00:21:07,860
<i>Like a child feels</i>

146
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,490
<i>Watching a rainbow</i>

147
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:12,796
<i>Like a bird feels</i>

148
00:21:12,868 --> 00:21:15,462
<i>The first time it flies</i>

149
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:17,938
<i>I feel magic</i>

150
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:20,771
<i>Stirring within me</i>

151
00:21:20,843 --> 00:21:25,712
<i>When I look
in my true love's eyes</i>

152
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:30,718
<i>Young as any spring</i>

153
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:35,587
<i>His eyes almost seem</i>

154
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:41,889
This shot be
just as sweet as pie.

155
00:22:13,662 --> 00:22:17,257
Jack? Jack?

156
00:22:19,101 --> 00:22:21,035
Jack!

157
00:22:22,338 --> 00:22:25,307
It was lovely...
like a dream.

158
00:22:25,374 --> 00:22:27,740
What you did is forbidden.

159
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,438
Who says so?

160
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:34,244
lt is known, Lily.
These are sacred animals.

161
00:22:34,316 --> 00:22:38,548
- I don't care.
- You risk your immortal soul
talking like that.

162
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:47,752
I only wanted to touch one.
Where's the harm in that?

163
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:52,691
It was magic.

164
00:22:54,937 --> 00:22:57,064
Thank you.

165
00:22:58,874 --> 00:23:01,104
Let me sing to you.

166
00:23:02,678 --> 00:23:05,772
<i>I'll chase your fears away.</i>

167
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:11,582
<i>ln the bumps and the hollows</i>

168
00:23:11,654 --> 00:23:16,591
<i>The sunlight and shadows</i>

169
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:20,618
<i>He kissed her as those</i>

170
00:23:20,696 --> 00:23:24,723
<i>Bluebells blow</i>

171
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:30,204
<i>As his lips met her breath</i>

172
00:23:30,272 --> 00:23:35,073
<i>He went sweetly to death</i>

173
00:23:35,144 --> 00:23:39,308
<i>At the roots
of the bluebells</i>

174
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:43,283
<i>ls where he is laid</i>

175
00:23:47,923 --> 00:23:50,949
Are you afraid
to kiss me, Jack?

176
00:23:51,026 --> 00:23:53,358
I'm afraid
you'll break my heart.

177
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:55,454
Then still your heart.

178
00:23:55,531 --> 00:23:58,466
You're dear to me
as life itself.

179
00:24:00,202 --> 00:24:02,329
Don't you wish this
was our wedding ring?

180
00:24:02,404 --> 00:24:04,338
If I say yes,
will my wish come true?

181
00:24:04,406 --> 00:24:06,738
I'm a princess.

182
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:10,245
It's my right to set
a challenge for my suitors.

183
00:24:10,312 --> 00:24:13,679
I will marry...

184
00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:15,842
whoever finds this ring.

185
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,484
Jack!

186
00:26:46,635 --> 00:26:50,867
Lily!

187
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:09,250
I smell human flesh!

188
00:28:12,521 --> 00:28:16,753
After you, Pig.
Oh, no, after you.

189
00:28:35,244 --> 00:28:38,702
Clock. Mortal world
turned to ice.

190
00:28:38,781 --> 00:28:42,683
Here be goblin paradise!

191
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:45,948
Plenty hospitality here.

192
00:28:46,021 --> 00:28:48,717
Baby!

193
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:51,954
I simply adore milk-fed meat.

194
00:28:52,027 --> 00:28:54,325
What are you,
some kind of animal?

195
00:29:06,337 --> 00:29:08,473
How did you do that, Blix?

196
00:29:08,544 --> 00:29:10,705
Yeah, tell us how
you do those tricks.

197
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:12,906
Quite easy, actually.

198
00:29:14,683 --> 00:29:17,743
Goblin omelette.

199
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,687
Very nice, very nice.

200
00:29:20,756 --> 00:29:25,284
Lucky day! Kill
ugly one-horned dead!

201
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,199
You act like you do all.

202
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,200
It was me who shoot
the poisoned stinger.

203
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,427
Me! Me! Me!

204
00:29:32,501 --> 00:29:35,698
You only got the shot in
because the princess was there.

205
00:29:35,771 --> 00:29:38,604
Wrong! 'Twas beauty
led the beast to bay.

206
00:29:38,674 --> 00:29:43,771
She was so sweet.
l could eat her brains like jam.

207
00:29:43,846 --> 00:29:47,145
- I could suck her bones--
- Enough!

208
00:29:47,216 --> 00:29:51,550
Better hurry. Dark Lord,
he don't like to wait.

209
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,536
What have I done?

210
00:30:18,614 --> 00:30:22,243
Four, five, six!
Hurray for Blix!

211
00:30:23,886 --> 00:30:25,878
I'll make it right.

212
00:30:56,551 --> 00:30:58,485
Jack.

213
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:09,223
Lily? Lily?

214
00:31:12,434 --> 00:31:15,460
Jack?

215
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,561
Who's there?

216
00:31:22,326 --> 00:31:23,726
Who are you?

217
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:27,771
You be forest child
and not know the Gump?

218
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:31,046
Gump, is it?

219
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,577
Honeythorn Gump
at your service.

220
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:50,764
I, I must be dreaming.

221
00:31:51,778 --> 00:31:55,776
If life is a dream,
better you dread the waking.

222
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,575
Jack?
Stop it!

223
00:31:59,648 --> 00:32:02,139
- That's Oona. She likes you.
- Go away!

224
00:32:02,943 --> 00:32:05,277
Does your blood
run so cold, Jack?

225
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,846
You'll be a gobs
before your time.

226
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,586
How'd you know my name?

227
00:32:13,762 --> 00:32:17,220
How does
a migrating swallow...

228
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:20,393
know the way south
in winter?

229
00:32:20,469 --> 00:32:22,699
Or a spawning salmon...

230
00:32:22,771 --> 00:32:25,399
find the very source
of his birth...

231
00:32:25,474 --> 00:32:30,411
from the cold, black depth
of the mysterious sea?

232
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:33,971
I know everything, Jack.

233
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:36,313
Everything?

234
00:32:42,224 --> 00:32:46,092
Then why is it like this?
Why is there winter now?

235
00:32:48,897 --> 00:32:52,333
I'd be a powerful wizard,
indeed, could I answer.

236
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:54,335
Suppose you tell me, Jack.

237
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:56,337
Me?

238
00:32:57,906 --> 00:33:01,307
You know these woods
as well as any elf.

239
00:33:07,883 --> 00:33:11,614
Did you not see
something odd today?

240
00:33:11,686 --> 00:33:14,211
Any strange spirits?

241
00:33:14,706 --> 00:33:16,723
Did nothing untoward happen?

242
00:33:19,852 --> 00:33:21,161
No.

243
00:33:21,229 --> 00:33:27,065
No? No?
Nothing?

244
00:33:28,648 --> 00:33:31,003
I did take Lily
to see the Unicorns.

245
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:34,668
You did what?

246
00:33:34,743 --> 00:33:37,678
Silence!

247
00:33:42,384 --> 00:33:44,352
Oh, God, Gump,
she touched him.

248
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:46,054
Touched it?

249
00:33:46,331 --> 00:33:48,792
A mortal
laid hands on a Unicorn?

250
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:52,224
Jack! Squawk, squawk,
no more talk!

251
00:33:54,563 --> 00:33:57,809
Do you think you can upset
the order of the universe...

252
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,509
and not pay the price?

253
00:33:59,544 --> 00:34:02,093
But she meant no wrong!

254
00:34:06,942 --> 00:34:09,706
What I did is done,
but I did it for love.

255
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,865
Silence!

256
00:34:14,516 --> 00:34:16,419
Love, you say?

257
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:18,939
But answer me this riddle...

258
00:34:19,554 --> 00:34:21,647
and all will be forgiven.

259
00:34:22,757 --> 00:34:25,123
- And if I cannot?
- Why, Jack,

260
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:28,253
then 'tis your death song
I'll be playing.

261
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:34,501
Then ask away...

262
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:37,595
and pray God
my answer pleases you.

263
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:59,887
What is a bell
that does not ring...

264
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:02,930
yet its knell
makes the angels sing?

265
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:05,511
- I know the answer.
- Shhh!

266
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:11,537
Answer me this...

267
00:35:11,606 --> 00:35:14,404
and all will be forgiven.

268
00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:34,395
Flowers?

269
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:35,974
Bluebells!

270
00:35:36,489 --> 00:35:38,133
To hear them ring
means your life is at an end!

271
00:35:38,168 --> 00:35:42,195
No!

272
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,476
Damn it! Damn it!
Damn it!

273
00:35:54,549 --> 00:35:57,040
Riddles! Riddles!
Riddles!

274
00:35:57,118 --> 00:36:01,316
Damn it! Riddles!
Riddles! Riddles!

275
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,494
Gump?

276
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:11,565
Gump?

277
00:36:18,006 --> 00:36:20,975
Gump?

278
00:36:23,144 --> 00:36:25,874
You've bested me, Jack.

279
00:36:25,947 --> 00:36:29,178
Bested me, bested me.

280
00:36:29,841 --> 00:36:31,973
A riddle without an answer's
like an empty cup

281
00:36:31,974 --> 00:36:33,095
when you're thirsty for wine.

282
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:34,315
Well spoken!

283
00:36:34,316 --> 00:36:37,592
And if it's wine you want,
it's wine we shall have.

284
00:36:37,843 --> 00:36:38,914
Brown Tom!

285
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:42,149
A small measure
of entertainment at best.

286
00:36:43,632 --> 00:36:47,193
But, Gump, it's the last bottle
of me best wine.

287
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:50,170
If you say so, sir.

288
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,572
Now, Gump, don't you
be forgetting me.

289
00:37:02,884 --> 00:37:05,250
Oh, careful now.

290
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,255
Oh, it's so precious.

291
00:37:08,323 --> 00:37:11,258
Elderberry wine.

292
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:14,386
- Sorry.
- No finer drink under heaven.

293
00:37:14,462 --> 00:37:16,794
Here's to Jack,

294
00:37:16,865 --> 00:37:21,529
riddle solver, dancing fool
and fairy friend.

295
00:37:21,603 --> 00:37:23,730
Tip it.

296
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,271
Here, this'll help.

297
00:37:33,692 --> 00:37:35,612
Don't you care
what's happened?

298
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:36,699
Of course we care.

299
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,475
What good's a world locked
in a season of death?

300
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,946
But we must find
the answer.
That we must.

301
00:37:42,023 --> 00:37:45,754
But first we must see that
no harm's come to the Unicorn.

302
00:37:45,827 --> 00:37:48,591
I sadly fear the worst.

303
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:36,269
Wait. Shhh.

304
00:38:42,684 --> 00:38:45,209
Lily!

305
00:38:46,855 --> 00:38:48,846
Jack! What?

306
00:39:39,607 --> 00:39:41,541
Jack!

307
00:41:24,965 --> 00:41:26,978
Forgive me.

308
00:41:31,553 --> 00:41:33,487
I meant no wrong.

309
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,243
Well, Jack...

310
00:42:21,574 --> 00:42:23,491
tell us what has happened.

311
00:42:32,947 --> 00:42:37,577
Come on, Jack.
Don't keep us in the dark.

312
00:42:37,652 --> 00:42:40,917
The dark
is where we'll stay.

313
00:42:41,735 --> 00:42:42,600
We're cursed.

314
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:46,654
Is there naughtin
we can do?

315
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:49,253
We must get
the alicorn back.

316
00:42:50,732 --> 00:42:54,793
Only then will the world
return to normal.

317
00:42:54,869 --> 00:42:58,202
We must find a champion.

318
00:42:58,272 --> 00:43:01,503
Bold of heart
and pure in spirit.

319
00:43:01,576 --> 00:43:04,443
Champion?
What champion?

320
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,777
Don't give up so quick, lads.

321
00:43:08,901 --> 00:43:10,113
You'll do.

322
00:43:11,853 --> 00:43:14,447
We must get you
some weapons.

323
00:43:14,522 --> 00:43:17,047
But, Gump, I know
nothing of weapons.

324
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:20,686
You'll learn. I know
where to find the best.

325
00:43:20,762 --> 00:43:24,630
Brown Tom,
stay here with the Unicorn
and guard her well.

326
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:26,513
Like me own life.
Better.

327
00:43:26,514 --> 00:43:28,496
She's the last of her kind.

328
00:43:41,115 --> 00:43:44,141
Magic horn
is mine, mine, mine.

329
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:47,619
Now all creatures
will love the night...

330
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:50,123
and worship goblins
as divine.

331
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,955
You shouldn't
talk like that, Blix.

332
00:43:53,027 --> 00:43:56,463
Why not?
I've got the power now.

333
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,728
Plenty big talk.

334
00:44:09,277 --> 00:44:13,304
Not even darkness
lasts forever.

335
00:44:19,187 --> 00:44:22,588
Jack, I can't go
with you now.

336
00:44:22,657 --> 00:44:25,023
Anyway, Oona
will guide the way.

337
00:44:29,697 --> 00:44:33,861
Follow me, Jack.
Over here. Come on.

338
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,391
Come on, Jack.

339
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,678
Here, Jack.
Come on.

340
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:56,134
Oona.

341
00:45:57,863 --> 00:46:01,721
Nobody knows but you.
It's our secret, Jack.

342
00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:05,850
Don't tell Gump. Promise?

343
00:46:05,927 --> 00:46:08,259
Promise!

344
00:46:08,329 --> 00:46:11,526
I could be anything
you want me to be,

345
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,534
even your heart's desire.

346
00:46:15,242 --> 00:46:17,696
You've got to help us,Jack.

347
00:46:17,772 --> 00:46:21,765
The fairies'love
makes anything possible.

348
00:46:31,252 --> 00:46:35,552
Higher, higher,
burning fire.

349
00:46:35,623 --> 00:46:39,491
Making music like a choir.

350
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,687
It seems a pity
to waste such power.

351
00:46:41,762 --> 00:46:45,562
Waste? Better watch out,
old pal Pox,

352
00:46:45,633 --> 00:46:48,568
or I'll turn you
into little pork chops.

353
00:46:48,636 --> 00:46:51,537
Why not turn everything
into garbage?

354
00:46:51,606 --> 00:46:54,439
A great towering
mountain of slop.

355
00:46:54,508 --> 00:46:57,636
Wouldn't that be magic?

356
00:46:57,712 --> 00:47:01,011
Higher, higher,
burning fire.

357
00:47:01,082 --> 00:47:05,246
Making music like a choir.

358
00:47:09,056 --> 00:47:10,293
Blix, Blix.

359
00:47:11,175 --> 00:47:12,644
Blix!

360
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:15,054
- What?
- Big D.!

361
00:47:19,252 --> 00:47:20,503
Stop!

362
00:47:21,168 --> 00:47:24,069
Hear me,
you angel of darkness!

363
00:47:24,138 --> 00:47:28,700
Your reign is over!
A new order begins!

364
00:47:28,776 --> 00:47:32,234
- I hold the power!
- Enough!

365
00:47:35,429 --> 00:47:36,445
Shit!

366
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:40,761
Please!
It was only a joke.

367
00:47:42,134 --> 00:47:43,619
I didn't mean it.

368
00:47:44,754 --> 00:47:46,438
No! No!

369
00:47:46,527 --> 00:47:48,791
Have you no sense of humor?

370
00:47:48,863 --> 00:47:50,854
Adios, amigos!

371
00:47:55,227 --> 00:47:57,060
Wow.

372
00:47:57,138 --> 00:47:59,883
Forgive that intrusion,
great lord,

373
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:02,570
but goblins are inclined
to be outspoken.

374
00:48:02,643 --> 00:48:04,770
Yeah.
and I like to encourage
their initiative.

375
00:48:04,845 --> 00:48:08,144
Did you think
this a mere plaything?

376
00:48:08,578 --> 00:48:11,776
With it,
my empire is eternal.

377
00:48:11,852 --> 00:48:14,446
Before I ruled
only the night.

378
00:48:14,522 --> 00:48:19,960
Now my minions
will frolic in darkness
until the end of time.

379
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:25,621
The Unicorns are dead,
is this not true?

380
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:29,500
True, lord,
very plenty true.
Undeniably true.

381
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:33,438
You lie!
Here is dawn!

382
00:48:33,507 --> 00:48:36,832
lt is essentially true.
On the other hand...

383
00:48:36,867 --> 00:48:39,744
Stallion is dead.
Dead as dreams.

384
00:48:39,814 --> 00:48:42,874
- Out with it!
- The mare lives still!

385
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:45,718
lf even one Unicorn
walks the earth,

386
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:47,493
my power is not complete.

387
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,156
She's just a female, lord.
She has no power.

388
00:48:50,224 --> 00:48:53,193
Only the power of creation.

389
00:48:53,796 --> 00:48:56,127
Get the mare!

390
00:48:57,147 --> 00:48:59,189
I command you!

391
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,434
Well, let's see,
what have we here?

392
00:49:05,506 --> 00:49:09,738
Ahh, a little sassafras.

393
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:12,040
A little spearmint
would be nice, huh?

394
00:49:12,766 --> 00:49:14,673
Some fox glove?

395
00:49:15,851 --> 00:49:18,742
And a little colt's foot.

396
00:49:21,715 --> 00:49:23,915
Hey, who goes there, what?

397
00:49:28,445 --> 00:49:30,524
I'm-- I'm Princess Lily.

398
00:49:30,598 --> 00:49:33,692
You! You're the cause
of all our sorrow.

399
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,670
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

400
00:49:38,165 --> 00:49:43,267
I didn't know.
Please, please forgive me.

401
00:49:43,344 --> 00:49:44,880
I'm not the one
you should be askin'.

402
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:46,174
Listen to me.

403
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,881
Try and understand.
I'm only trying
to make things right.

404
00:49:50,951 --> 00:49:53,886
Darkness has sent the goblins
back for the mare.

405
00:49:53,954 --> 00:49:56,650
It's not safe to stay here.
You'll have to hurry!

406
00:49:56,651 --> 00:49:57,651
Leave now! Go!

407
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,224
Good lass. You're
a plucky little partridge.

408
00:50:01,295 --> 00:50:04,389
- Hurry! Aaah!
- Too late!

409
00:50:04,465 --> 00:50:05,593
You imps are lookin'
for a fight

410
00:50:05,594 --> 00:50:06,594
you come to the chap
who'll oblige ya.

411
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,605
Try this on for size.

412
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,615
You can't beat me.
Ha-ha, look at that!

413
00:50:22,683 --> 00:50:25,584
Keep 'em coming, fellas!
Ha-ha!

414
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,232
Oh, check this out!

415
00:50:28,048 --> 00:50:30,308
Yes, sir.
You see?

416
00:50:30,624 --> 00:50:35,186
You just can't beat me!
You can't--

417
00:50:35,262 --> 00:50:39,756
Little tool is stuck.
They done for me.

418
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,013
Quick!

419
00:50:57,284 --> 00:50:59,946
Wait for me!

420
00:51:04,225 --> 00:51:06,250
Brown Tom!

421
00:51:10,364 --> 00:51:11,697
Brown Tom...

422
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,542
you can't be dead.

423
00:51:14,702 --> 00:51:17,170
This is terrible.
Terrible!

424
00:51:17,847 --> 00:51:20,230
- Brown Tom.
- Brown Tom.

425
00:51:20,886 --> 00:51:22,332
Gump?

426
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:24,536
Screwball.

427
00:51:24,612 --> 00:51:27,137
Jack, lad.

428
00:51:27,904 --> 00:51:31,742
- They killed you too?
- Of course they didn't.

429
00:51:31,819 --> 00:51:34,998
- But what in blazes
are you talking about?

430
00:51:34,999 --> 00:51:35,999
Goblins.

431
00:51:36,828 --> 00:51:39,056
Shot me through me brain pan.

432
00:51:41,562 --> 00:51:44,224
That's one spot an arrow
will do no harm.

433
00:51:44,298 --> 00:51:46,320
I did my best to fight 'em off

434
00:51:46,321 --> 00:51:48,792
but they swarmed up
by the hundreds.

435
00:51:48,903 --> 00:51:50,935
All fierce creatures they were.

436
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:53,517
The princess warned me, but...

437
00:51:53,524 --> 00:51:54,684
Lily?

438
00:51:55,098 --> 00:51:55,882
Aye.

439
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:57,810
Then she's alive!

440
00:51:57,878 --> 00:52:00,813
She was alive still
when they killed me.

441
00:52:00,881 --> 00:52:02,441
The goblins
must have taken her.

442
00:52:02,584 --> 00:52:05,017
We follow their tracks
in the snow.

443
00:52:10,624 --> 00:52:12,888
The Great Tree.

444
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,191
When evil anarchy
ruled the land,

445
00:52:16,263 --> 00:52:19,494
the wicked came here
to sacrifice.

446
00:52:53,318 --> 00:52:56,395
Ugly. I hate it.

447
00:52:56,866 --> 00:52:59,098
Good. You go first.

448
00:52:59,173 --> 00:53:01,698
Why always me?

449
00:53:01,775 --> 00:53:04,335
Go!

450
00:53:09,315 --> 00:53:10,754
Foreigner.

451
00:53:39,184 --> 00:53:40,173
I made it!

452
00:53:40,709 --> 00:53:41,618
Screwball!

453
00:53:55,329 --> 00:53:57,923
Foul-tasting fairy!

454
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:06,537
Come to Meg, juicy boy.

455
00:54:11,645 --> 00:54:15,547
Who be this tender morsel...

456
00:54:16,188 --> 00:54:20,383
disturbing Meg Mucklebone's rest?

457
00:54:21,512 --> 00:54:24,515
Jack.
They call me Jack, ma'am.

458
00:54:27,594 --> 00:54:31,894
And what a fine,
fat boy you are, Jack.

459
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:34,297
You don't really mean
to eat me, do you, ma'am?

460
00:54:34,368 --> 00:54:37,826
Oh, indeed I do!

461
00:54:39,873 --> 00:54:43,400
But that would be a shame,
because someone as fair...

462
00:54:43,934 --> 00:54:45,915
and lovely as yourself,
Miss Meg...

463
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:48,176
deserves far better
than scrawny me.

464
00:54:50,217 --> 00:54:52,811
Don't you think?

465
00:54:53,652 --> 00:54:58,518
You think me fair,
do you, Jack?

466
00:54:59,293 --> 00:55:02,653
All the heavenly angels
must envy your beauty.

467
00:55:10,871 --> 00:55:13,499
What a fine meal
you'll make,

468
00:55:13,574 --> 00:55:17,635
be the rest of you
as sweet as your tongue.

469
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,428
Wait! No!

470
00:55:19,813 --> 00:55:24,045
Your Loveliness, feast on
the beauty of your reflection.

471
00:55:24,118 --> 00:55:27,610
You are an angel, Miss Meg.

472
00:55:27,688 --> 00:55:31,055
Look.
Look.

473
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:33,753
What a splendid idea.

474
00:55:39,266 --> 00:55:41,200
Clever boy!

475
00:55:45,506 --> 00:55:49,772
Your alchemy makes
crusted steel shine like silver.

476
00:55:51,044 --> 00:55:53,137
That's discerning taste...

477
00:55:53,213 --> 00:55:56,239
for one so young, Jack.

478
00:56:02,689 --> 00:56:06,147
Come. Come,Jack!

479
00:56:06,226 --> 00:56:09,252
Give us a kiss...
before dining!

480
00:56:25,846 --> 00:56:28,440
I did it!

481
00:57:48,964 --> 00:57:50,130
Screwball!

482
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,029
Okay. Okay.

483
00:58:00,107 --> 00:58:03,907
Oh! Whee! Look.

484
00:58:03,977 --> 00:58:07,538
What a big trumpet!
I'll bet it makes a lot of noise.

485
00:58:07,614 --> 00:58:10,344
Our lives are lost if it blows.

486
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,608
I think it stopped.

487
00:58:43,172 --> 00:58:44,074
Look out!

488
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:56,158
My back! Me achin'back!

489
00:58:56,916 --> 00:59:00,097
I'm not as old
as I used to be, you know.

490
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,532
Hey, where are we?

491
00:59:07,191 --> 00:59:09,542
Someplace
we don't want to be.

492
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:16,447
Hey, hey!
Wait for me!

493
00:59:16,516 --> 00:59:20,316
We gotta get out of here!
It's the stench of hell itself!

494
00:59:22,356 --> 00:59:25,189
Shh! Quiet!

495
00:59:25,258 --> 00:59:29,558
You'll be fricasseed fairies
if you don't keep quiet.

496
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,894
Who be you, bucket head?

497
00:59:31,965 --> 00:59:35,264
Who I am won't help me
nor you, neither,

498
00:59:35,335 --> 00:59:38,634
even though
we are all brothers.

499
00:59:43,202 --> 00:59:44,800
What happened to you?

500
00:59:44,878 --> 00:59:46,812
It's a long story.

501
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,372
Let's just say
I went looking for adventure...

502
00:59:50,407 --> 00:59:53,764
and found
more than I could handle.

503
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:56,849
Doesn't matter now anyway.

504
00:59:56,923 --> 01:00:00,188
We are all in the same fix!

505
01:00:01,528 --> 01:00:05,618
I knew it. I knew it.
I should have stayed at home.

506
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,698
Let's face it, brothers.

507
01:00:07,768 --> 01:00:11,146
Me and you all...

508
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:13,239
is barbecue.

509
01:00:16,376 --> 01:00:19,368
- Barbecue?
- That's right. Barbecue.

510
01:00:19,446 --> 01:00:22,347
Only dead meat waits
for the stew pot.

511
01:00:24,184 --> 01:00:26,846
Spring the lock
with your magic, Gump.

512
01:00:42,903 --> 01:00:45,098
Iron is trouble for elves.

513
01:00:45,172 --> 01:00:47,106
Iron, huh?

514
01:01:07,227 --> 01:01:09,161
The thing!

515
01:01:12,399 --> 01:01:15,800
Oh, no!
He's coming! Hide!

516
01:01:15,869 --> 01:01:17,336
Hide!
Hide! Hide!

517
01:01:25,011 --> 01:01:27,070
I don't think I can handle it!
Help me!

518
01:02:01,072 --> 01:02:03,510
Let me go! Let me go!

519
01:02:03,583 --> 01:02:07,781
Help! Help me!

520
01:02:09,256 --> 01:02:11,121
Please! Please!

521
01:02:11,191 --> 01:02:13,625
Help me!

522
01:02:14,293 --> 01:02:17,356
You beast!
Help me!

523
01:02:25,686 --> 01:02:28,535
Let me go!

524
01:02:37,484 --> 01:02:40,248
Gump, we've got to help him.

525
01:02:41,309 --> 01:02:43,255
Ddon't worry. Our brother
can take care of himself.

526
01:02:43,323 --> 01:02:46,292
I'm sure of it,
I think.

527
01:02:46,359 --> 01:02:47,826
Screwball's right.

528
01:02:47,827 --> 01:02:50,358
It's more important
that you find the Unicorn.

529
01:02:50,393 --> 01:02:53,532
Why not have Oona fly out,
find a key?

530
01:02:54,668 --> 01:02:58,035
Oona?
But she's much too small.

531
01:02:58,104 --> 01:03:00,072
Could never lift it.

532
01:03:01,441 --> 01:03:02,806
Our secret!

533
01:03:02,876 --> 01:03:05,786
Our secret will keep forever
in this grave if you don't help us.

534
01:03:06,231 --> 01:03:07,629
You promised!

535
01:03:08,748 --> 01:03:12,844
You willful sprite.
How dare you keep such secrets?

536
01:03:12,919 --> 01:03:15,251
They're mine to keep.

537
01:03:20,427 --> 01:03:22,560
I'll do what you ask...

538
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:25,284
if you'll kiss me, Jack.

539
01:03:35,108 --> 01:03:37,042
Easy enough.

540
01:03:43,283 --> 01:03:45,497
You call that a kiss?

541
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,205
Am I not sweet?

542
01:03:51,091 --> 01:03:54,060
Sweeter than bee pollen...

543
01:03:54,127 --> 01:03:56,095
on a summer wind.

544
01:03:57,797 --> 01:04:01,255
Sweet as the wind
that blows me to you.

545
01:04:05,793 --> 01:04:07,502
It's fairy magic.

546
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:11,108
Lily?

547
01:04:11,177 --> 01:04:15,614
- Lily?
- Yes, Jack.

548
01:04:25,066 --> 01:04:26,314
This isn't real.

549
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:29,157
Oh, it is.

550
01:04:29,229 --> 01:04:32,130
I'm warm and alive...

551
01:04:32,198 --> 01:04:34,632
and want to be in your arms.

552
01:04:58,024 --> 01:05:01,152
No, I, I can't. No.

553
01:05:01,227 --> 01:05:03,661
This is just
more fairy glamour.

554
01:05:06,066 --> 01:05:09,524
Human hearts
don't work that way.

555
01:05:09,602 --> 01:05:12,127
What care I
for human hearts?

556
01:05:12,205 --> 01:05:15,265
Soft and spiritless
as porridge!

557
01:05:15,342 --> 01:05:18,971
A fairy's heart beats
fierce and free!

558
01:05:25,585 --> 01:05:29,453
Oona!

559
01:05:29,522 --> 01:05:33,324
Your fine sensibilities
have left us here to rot!

560
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,591
I'm behind you all the way, Gump.

561
01:05:41,034 --> 01:05:44,765
You look like mourners
at your own funeral.

562
01:05:48,308 --> 01:05:51,277
Oona!

563
01:05:58,676 --> 01:05:59,783
Quick, lads!

564
01:06:05,789 --> 01:06:07,786
You!

565
01:06:07,861 --> 01:06:11,353
You mortal, you!

566
01:06:11,431 --> 01:06:16,198
I could vex you!
Dance your life away!

567
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,946
I'll stay here and...

568
01:06:35,807 --> 01:06:37,042
Wait for me!

569
01:06:53,537 --> 01:06:57,869
A terrible sight
for a sober man.

570
01:07:09,565 --> 01:07:11,717
We must find the dungeons.

571
01:07:12,317 --> 01:07:14,698
I think I'll stay right here,
thank you very much.

572
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:15,616
Not so fast!

573
01:07:15,651 --> 01:07:17,335
You'll search
with the rest of us.

574
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:19,731
- Then I'll go with Jack.
- No! We split up.

575
01:07:20,344 --> 01:07:22,498
Yes! It's better
if we go in teams.

576
01:07:22,533 --> 01:07:25,066
- No, I will go with Ja--
- Shh!

577
01:07:25,138 --> 01:07:27,470
Gump and me,
Brown Tom and Screwball.

578
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:29,474
Right. Let's synchronize.

579
01:07:41,121 --> 01:07:46,058
We meet back here in twice
500 beats of a bluebird's heart.

580
01:07:46,126 --> 01:07:47,265
Do you know what I think?

581
01:07:47,266 --> 01:07:50,135
I think we should add a couple
more hundred breaths of a--

582
01:07:52,532 --> 01:07:54,830
Take care.
Come on, Jack.

583
01:07:57,937 --> 01:07:59,871
Be careful.

584
01:08:05,201 --> 01:08:07,574
There's only one thing
I want to know.

585
01:08:07,575 --> 01:08:08,369
What?

586
01:08:08,915 --> 01:08:11,281
Why me?

587
01:08:11,351 --> 01:08:13,425
I think we should
go west.

588
01:08:13,426 --> 01:08:14,698
I think we should go east.

589
01:08:14,988 --> 01:08:16,922
Oh, okay.
Wait!

590
01:08:19,192 --> 01:08:23,925
Father, I hold the world
in my grasp,

591
01:08:23,997 --> 01:08:29,401
and yet this girl...
distracts me.

592
01:08:29,469 --> 01:08:33,701
lt has been an eternity
since I felt such desire.

593
01:08:33,773 --> 01:08:36,241
What am I to do?

594
01:08:36,309 --> 01:08:41,941
She fascinates you
because her soul is pure.

595
01:08:42,015 --> 01:08:44,882
- I'll take her then.
- Fool!

596
01:08:44,951 --> 01:08:49,820
You must woo her!

597
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:55,691
She remembers the world
as it was,

598
01:08:55,762 --> 01:08:58,856
so... tempt her.

599
01:08:58,932 --> 01:09:02,095
Win her.

600
01:09:02,168 --> 01:09:06,195
Make her one of us.

601
01:09:26,559 --> 01:09:28,493
Did, did you see something?

602
01:09:28,561 --> 01:09:31,689
- No, did you?
- I don't know.

603
01:09:31,764 --> 01:09:33,698
I think.

604
01:11:18,771 --> 01:11:21,205
D-D-D-Did you hear that?

605
01:11:21,697 --> 01:11:23,208
What's that?

606
01:11:23,276 --> 01:11:25,109
That's a horse,
you idiot.

607
01:11:32,185 --> 01:11:36,349
Woo her.

608
01:11:36,422 --> 01:11:39,289
Woo her.

609
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:21,295
Win her.

610
01:13:55,995 --> 01:13:59,795
Make her one of us.

611
01:17:17,797 --> 01:17:22,393
Lady, do not be afraid.

612
01:17:23,002 --> 01:17:27,735
Quiet, quiet.

613
01:17:29,508 --> 01:17:32,568
How like you my gifts?

614
01:17:32,645 --> 01:17:36,342
Does the gown
not please you?

615
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:40,477
No.

616
01:17:42,555 --> 01:17:46,958
Can you speak so
of your bridal gown?

617
01:17:47,026 --> 01:17:49,586
I've found my true mate,

618
01:17:49,662 --> 01:17:52,187
and you know it.

619
01:17:52,264 --> 01:17:53,249
Never.

620
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:58,250
Beneath the skin,
we are already one.

621
01:18:00,606 --> 01:18:04,268
Was it not your sin
trapped the Unicorn?

622
01:18:04,704 --> 01:18:08,908
Even now the evil seed
of what you have done...

623
01:18:08,981 --> 01:18:11,916
germinates within you.

624
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,544
No. You lie.

625
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,112
You disgust me.

626
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:20,124
You're nothing
but an animal.

627
01:18:23,863 --> 01:18:27,629
We are all animals,
my lady.

628
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:31,067
Most are too afraid
to see it.

629
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,271
- Lily!
- Jack.

630
01:18:50,306 --> 01:18:53,216
There's nothing
you can do now to help her.

631
01:18:53,292 --> 01:18:55,886
Be thankful she still lives.

632
01:18:55,961 --> 01:18:57,895
You've got to help us,
Jack.

633
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:02,059
The last Unicorn dies
tonight.

634
01:19:03,736 --> 01:19:06,637
As her blood ebbs...

635
01:19:06,705 --> 01:19:09,902
the sun sets forever.

636
01:19:09,975 --> 01:19:15,379
There shall never be
another dawn.

637
01:19:15,447 --> 01:19:17,677
No!

638
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,118
Lady...

639
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:23,395
I require the solace
of the shadows...

640
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:27,258
and the dark of the night.

641
01:19:27,326 --> 01:19:31,786
Sunshine is my destroyer!

642
01:19:38,237 --> 01:19:40,603
Damn you!

643
01:19:40,673 --> 01:19:44,803
We are all of us damned,
my queen.

644
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:50,813
As long as the sun still shines...

645
01:19:50,883 --> 01:19:53,875
we can destroy him.

646
01:19:54,806 --> 01:19:56,649
Let me dazzle you
with my wisdom.

647
01:19:59,191 --> 01:20:01,125
I think I know a way.

648
01:20:05,965 --> 01:20:09,230
Come on, come on, come on.
You're holding us up.

649
01:20:09,301 --> 01:20:12,532
Listen. We're not going down
the same corridor umpteen times.

650
01:20:12,605 --> 01:20:14,937
I think we should go that way.
No, we're going this way.

651
01:20:15,007 --> 01:20:16,941
No, not me.

652
01:20:21,313 --> 01:20:24,578
Let's go down there.
Stay close to me now.

653
01:20:40,766 --> 01:20:42,700
- You know what?
- What?

654
01:20:42,768 --> 01:20:45,794
- I vote we run like hell.
- I second the motion.

655
01:20:48,674 --> 01:20:50,642
Screwball.

656
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:55,999
Where were you?

657
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,061
In another three flicks
of a badger's tail,

658
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,062
we would have gone.

659
01:21:00,819 --> 01:21:03,481
While you're having fun,
time goes by fast.

660
01:21:03,555 --> 01:21:07,500
Yeah, we found the mare,
and it's alive in the dungeon.

661
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:09,361
Excellent.
Excellent, you two!

662
01:21:09,902 --> 01:21:11,658
Thank you very much.

663
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:14,450
Now Jack has a plan,
and a good one!

664
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:18,069
We must gather every
shining object we can find.

665
01:21:18,634 --> 01:21:21,903
We're going to bring light
to darkness.

666
01:21:57,643 --> 01:21:59,577
Blunder.

667
01:22:16,328 --> 01:22:18,819
Blunder!

668
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,796
Any more noise,
and you're shish kebab.

669
01:22:23,869 --> 01:22:26,982
You do what we say, understand?
Swear it.

670
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:31,438
I swear it on the festering
forelock of Nicodemus!

671
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:35,310
Please, help. Help me.

672
01:22:38,017 --> 01:22:39,951
Thank you.

673
01:22:43,956 --> 01:22:47,289
Judge me not so harshly,
mistress.

674
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:50,453
I invite you
to share this supper.

675
01:22:50,529 --> 01:22:53,760
Look how sweet it is.

676
01:23:56,462 --> 01:23:59,829
Hurry, hurry. Keep 'em comin'!
Come on, come on!

677
01:24:25,511 --> 01:24:27,081
Brown Tom!

678
01:26:10,242 --> 01:26:11,174
Gump?

679
01:26:14,546 --> 01:26:16,509
Gump!

680
01:26:17,550 --> 01:26:18,353
Jack?

681
01:26:23,675 --> 01:26:25,768
Three cheers
for our champion!

682
01:26:25,844 --> 01:26:27,209
Hip hip! Hooray!

683
01:26:27,279 --> 01:26:29,543
Hip hip! Hooray!

684
01:26:29,615 --> 01:26:31,310
Hip hip! Hooray!

685
01:26:57,379 --> 01:26:59,102
Now what, Jack?

686
01:26:59,511 --> 01:27:01,270
Must go all the way out.

687
01:27:04,554 --> 01:27:05,916
Light.

688
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:10,054
Not much to hold on to.

689
01:27:10,122 --> 01:27:13,285
Take a pea pod pixie
to make that climb.

690
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:21,732
I'll do it.

691
01:27:24,469 --> 01:27:27,223
What's the matter? Ain't I
small enough for the job?

692
01:27:27,726 --> 01:27:30,572
No job is too small
for my little brother.

693
01:27:30,642 --> 01:27:34,578
Please, Gump. Let me try.
I won't let you down.

694
01:27:36,315 --> 01:27:38,806
All right, all right.
Do it, but be swift!

695
01:27:38,884 --> 01:27:42,411
Oh, thank you, thank you.
You'll never regret it.

696
01:27:42,487 --> 01:27:46,480
I always knew you'd
be going places, Screwball.

697
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,229
- Eat.
- I'm not hungry.

698
01:27:56,684 --> 01:27:59,031
You lie.

699
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:03,132
Just to please me.

700
01:28:03,208 --> 01:28:05,676
I do nothing
for your pleasure.

701
01:28:09,581 --> 01:28:11,515
All I wish...

702
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:15,929
is for you to sit
and talk with me.

703
01:28:15,964 --> 01:28:18,153
Sit?

704
01:28:20,859 --> 01:28:23,726
- Here?
- Yes.

705
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:25,845
Please.

706
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:28,425
- I prefer to stand.
- Sit!

707
01:28:32,371 --> 01:28:34,112
Or stand.

708
01:28:34,907 --> 01:28:37,124
As you wish.

709
01:28:37,159 --> 01:28:40,504
lt is enough that
we are alone together.

710
01:28:42,247 --> 01:28:44,181
Just the two of us.

711
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:50,218
Some...

712
01:28:51,309 --> 01:28:54,117
simple conversation.

713
01:28:54,459 --> 01:28:57,257
I have nothing
to talk about.

714
01:28:58,330 --> 01:29:01,561
You've stolen my dreams away.

715
01:29:01,633 --> 01:29:03,726
All things change, Lady.

716
01:29:05,604 --> 01:29:08,164
The dreams of youth...

717
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:11,403
are the regrets of maturity.

718
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:17,376
Dreams are my specialty.

719
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,251
Through dreams
l influence mankind.

720
01:29:22,061 --> 01:29:24,413
My dream...

721
01:29:24,489 --> 01:29:27,947
is of eternity with you.

722
01:29:30,462 --> 01:29:35,126
I offer you this rose,
Princess--

723
01:29:37,936 --> 01:29:39,474
my heart,

724
01:29:40,939 --> 01:29:42,873
my soul,

725
01:29:43,942 --> 01:29:46,001
my love.

726
01:29:46,077 --> 01:29:48,238
Love?

727
01:30:03,829 --> 01:30:07,390
Once I was content
with solitude...

728
01:30:07,466 --> 01:30:10,060
until that moment...

729
01:30:10,135 --> 01:30:13,901
I felt your vivid presence.

730
01:30:15,207 --> 01:30:17,175
A little to the right.

731
01:30:17,242 --> 01:30:18,181
Left.

732
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:19,413
Good!

733
01:30:21,636 --> 01:30:26,708
It grows late. Sit.

734
01:30:27,235 --> 01:30:29,754
I value your thoughts.

735
01:30:29,821 --> 01:30:32,483
Share them with me.

736
01:31:12,797 --> 01:31:14,731
- Sit?
- Yes.

737
01:31:14,799 --> 01:31:18,140
- Nothing more than that?
- And talk with me.

738
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:31,943
I think I'll stand,
if you don't mind.

739
01:31:32,017 --> 01:31:37,045
Sit! Damn you!

740
01:31:37,122 --> 01:31:40,319
No! Never! Never!

741
01:32:01,095 --> 01:32:03,342
I hear a throat
begging to be cut.

742
01:32:10,789 --> 01:32:14,156
Are you so... anxious...

743
01:32:14,225 --> 01:32:16,216
to see blood flow?

744
01:32:16,294 --> 01:32:17,829
As you are to drink it.

745
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:21,200
Grant your bride
one wish on this night.

746
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:22,499
You have but to ask.

747
01:32:22,567 --> 01:32:24,865
I will stay here with you
as you wish.

748
01:32:27,505 --> 01:32:29,735
- But on one condition.
- Anything.

749
01:32:31,943 --> 01:32:35,674
I want to kill the Unicorn.

750
01:32:55,287 --> 01:32:57,194
I can't let that happen.

751
01:33:06,277 --> 01:33:09,212
In the beginning...

752
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,942
there was nothing--

753
01:33:14,152 --> 01:33:18,452
a void of darkness,

754
01:33:18,523 --> 01:33:23,333
a cold eternity
of silence.

755
01:33:24,029 --> 01:33:25,385
Jack!

756
01:33:26,012 --> 01:33:28,238
Your greatest challenge
is still to come.

757
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:31,498
And we have not much time.

758
01:33:40,378 --> 01:33:44,405
When the perfect void
was corrupted...

759
01:33:44,482 --> 01:33:46,416
by light,

760
01:33:46,484 --> 01:33:49,647
a great wailing was heard,

761
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:54,600
and all the brethren 
fled in terror.

762
01:33:54,858 --> 01:33:57,222
Gump!

763
01:33:57,295 --> 01:33:59,525
Oona, fly up like the wind.

764
01:33:59,597 --> 01:34:01,531
It's time.

765
01:34:08,673 --> 01:34:09,869
Jack!

766
01:35:14,972 --> 01:35:16,573
Lily.
Jack.

767
01:35:16,641 --> 01:35:19,838
Judge her with your heart,

768
01:35:19,911 --> 01:35:22,004
not your eyes.

769
01:35:23,581 --> 01:35:25,515
Hear me,

770
01:35:25,583 --> 01:35:28,518
ye powers of the night!

771
01:35:29,345 --> 01:35:32,386
We offer this sacrifice,

772
01:35:32,457 --> 01:35:35,119
in honor of you,

773
01:35:36,194 --> 01:35:40,187
sanctified with blood...

774
01:35:42,467 --> 01:35:45,231
and with fire!

775
01:35:56,281 --> 01:35:59,250
I pray you, Father,

776
01:35:59,317 --> 01:36:01,979
accept my sacrifice.

777
01:36:02,358 --> 01:36:07,958
Let light
be forever extinguished.

778
01:36:08,993 --> 01:36:13,396
Let the age of darkness begin!

779
01:36:13,464 --> 01:36:15,955
Come, Lady.

780
01:36:16,034 --> 01:36:20,801
The birth of a new world
awaits your stroke.

781
01:36:23,074 --> 01:36:26,601
Let my offering be made
of flesh and blood.

782
01:36:28,012 --> 01:36:31,778
She means to do it, Jack.
She's one of them.

783
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:34,284
I am sister to the Fates.

784
01:36:34,352 --> 01:36:37,412
Kill her. Forget her.

785
01:36:37,488 --> 01:36:40,787
Think about the Unicorn.

786
01:36:48,702 --> 01:36:49,838
Do it!

787
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:51,464
Lily.

788
01:36:51,499 --> 01:36:53,684
- I'll do it.
- No!

789
01:36:55,031 --> 01:36:56,535
No.

790
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,907
I trust you, Lily.

791
01:37:02,981 --> 01:37:05,313
I'll always trust you.

792
01:37:08,586 --> 01:37:10,747
Run!

793
01:37:10,822 --> 01:37:13,882
Run!
You're free!

794
01:37:15,493 --> 01:37:17,552
Darkness!

795
01:37:46,939 --> 01:37:49,623
What have we here?

796
01:37:50,165 --> 01:37:52,128
A little boy.

797
01:38:18,723 --> 01:38:21,214
Screwball!
Screwball, wake up!

798
01:38:36,174 --> 01:38:38,005
Wake up, Screwball!
Wake up!

799
01:38:39,077 --> 01:38:43,241
It's always a pleasure
to take a brave man's life.

800
01:38:47,752 --> 01:38:49,117
Wake up!

801
01:39:17,559 --> 01:39:21,610
Don't you know me, boy?

802
01:39:43,198 --> 01:39:44,170
What time is it?

803
01:39:44,742 --> 01:39:48,234
Every wolf suffers fleas.

804
01:39:48,312 --> 01:39:51,145
'Tis easy enough to scratch.

805
01:40:05,630 --> 01:40:08,861
Give it to me, boy!

806
01:40:30,221 --> 01:40:32,655
Father!

807
01:40:32,723 --> 01:40:35,783
Protect me!

808
01:40:46,571 --> 01:40:49,836
You think you have won!

809
01:40:51,766 --> 01:40:54,403
What is light...

810
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:56,413
without dark?

811
01:40:57,949 --> 01:41:00,110
What are you...

812
01:41:00,184 --> 01:41:03,449
without me?

813
01:41:06,657 --> 01:41:10,252
I am a part of you all.

814
01:41:10,328 --> 01:41:15,027
You can never defeat me.

815
01:41:15,099 --> 01:41:17,465
We are brothers...

816
01:41:17,535 --> 01:41:19,264
eternal!

817
01:41:19,337 --> 01:41:22,101
Do it, Jack! Kill him!

818
01:41:22,173 --> 01:41:24,437
Kill him!

819
01:42:07,558 --> 01:42:09,712
She's under a spell.

820
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,278
A powerful spell.

821
01:42:13,491 --> 01:42:15,482
Do something.

822
01:42:17,695 --> 01:42:20,323
Look what we've been through.

823
01:42:22,580 --> 01:42:24,428
Look who you are.

824
01:42:24,778 --> 01:42:26,697
Have faith in yourself.

825
01:42:26,771 --> 01:42:30,468
lt is the greatest lesson
you have learned.

826
01:42:34,912 --> 01:42:37,176
I'm a princess.

827
01:42:37,248 --> 01:42:40,843
It's my right to set
a challenge for my suitors.

828
01:42:42,431 --> 01:42:45,685
I will marry...
whoever finds this ring.

829
01:42:48,559 --> 01:42:51,105
We too have
a promise to keep.

830
01:42:53,262 --> 01:42:55,363
Now fulfill your promise.

831
01:42:57,034 --> 01:42:58,831
I will miss you.

832
01:42:58,903 --> 01:43:01,929
- But don't forget us.
- Never.

833
01:44:57,788 --> 01:45:00,120
I love you, Lily.

834
01:45:01,692 --> 01:45:03,626
Come back to me.

835
01:45:06,163 --> 01:45:08,097
Come back to me.

836
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:21,074
I... love you, Jack.

837
01:45:38,747 --> 01:45:40,220
I love you, Lily.

838
01:45:41,699 --> 01:45:43,997
I had such a terrible
nightmare.

839
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,536
Did you?

840
01:45:48,372 --> 01:45:50,306
It's over.

841
01:46:06,056 --> 01:46:09,135
Jack, was it all a dream?

842
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:11,689
You're safe now.

843
01:46:15,566 --> 01:46:19,229
So many terrible things
happened.

844
01:46:19,303 --> 01:46:21,635
I--

845
01:46:22,706 --> 01:46:26,142
I learned something
about myself...

846
01:46:26,210 --> 01:46:28,405
and something about you.

847
01:46:28,479 --> 01:46:30,777
What's that?

848
01:46:30,848 --> 01:46:33,783
You belong here.

849
01:46:34,498 --> 01:46:36,376
You're my prince.

850
01:46:39,190 --> 01:46:41,124
I'm only Jack.

851
01:46:41,192 --> 01:46:43,660
My Lord Jack.

852
01:47:24,435 --> 01:47:26,369
So you take that...

853
01:47:26,437 --> 01:47:28,905
and you keep it,
treasure it.

854
01:47:30,841 --> 01:47:32,775
It's part of me.

855
01:47:36,881 --> 01:47:40,248
Can I come tomorrow?

856
01:47:40,317 --> 01:47:42,251
Of course.

857
01:47:43,487 --> 01:47:46,251
I'll be here.

858
01:47:46,323 --> 01:47:48,723
I'll always be here
for you, Lily.

859
01:47:55,533 --> 01:47:57,467
Will you sing for me?

860
01:48:01,038 --> 01:48:03,438
<i>Come down, sparrow</i>

861
01:48:03,507 --> 01:48:05,805
<i>Sing me good morning</i>

862
01:48:05,876 --> 01:48:10,176
<i>Rise up, sun
like the arch of the sky</i>

863
01:48:10,247 --> 01:48:12,306
<i>Living river</i>

864
01:48:12,383 --> 01:48:14,908
<i>Turn light to diamonds</i>

865
01:48:14,985 --> 01:48:18,580
<i>When I look
in my true love's eyes</i>

866
01:48:19,305 --> 01:49:19,267
