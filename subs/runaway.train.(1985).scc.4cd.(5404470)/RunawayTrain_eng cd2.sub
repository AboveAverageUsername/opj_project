{0}{56}That makes sense.
{116}{144}Oh, man.
{243}{337}He's in trouble out there.|Let's go help him.

{1144}{1178}Ah, man.
{1316}{1363}What are you doing here?
{1394}{1499}I work on this train.|What are you doing here?
{1526}{1580}I'll tell you what|we're doing here.
{1581}{1717}We're on our way to Las Vegas|to see our close friend Wayne Newton.
{1719}{1770}Why? Are you collecting tickets...
{1772}{1806}sweetheart?
{1833}{1888}Hey, sweetheart...
{1889}{1930}how would you like|a really good fuck, huh?
{1932}{1978}Just try it!
{2012}{2058}Freeze on that bullshit.
{2165}{2217}What happened to you?
{2219}{2280}I was tired.|I was taking a nap.
{2306}{2389}I shouldn't have done it,|but I did it. So what?
{2390}{2465}My head got hit when we|slammed into that caboose.
{2467}{2537}I don't know what happened,|but there's no engineer on this train.
{2538}{2593}There's nobody on|this train but us!
{2595}{2645}She's lying.|We heard the whistle.
{2647}{2726}- I blew the whistle!|- You're trying to get us busted.
{2728}{2793}Listen! This runaway's gonna|run into something very fast.
{2795}{2900}I climbed back here, the last engine,|where it's safer. Get it?
{2997}{3046}I don't believe her bullshit.
{3048}{3094}You don't believe me?
{3125}{3208}Just look out the window.|See how fast we're going?
{3209}{3290}This train is out of control.|We can get killed!
{3470}{3549}Then we better|do something about it!
{3551}{3622}What about the hostler helper?|A woman.
{3624}{3721}Goddamn it! Does she know anything|about running a locomotive?
{3723}{3757}Shit.
{3792}{3821}The only person on|the whole train is a woman.
{3823}{3873}How lucky can I get?
{4071}{4120}-Now what?|-It's chief of security from Stonehaven.
{4121}{4202}- His name Ranken. He wants to see you.|- I don't have time for him!
{4204}{4275}- He says it's important.|- Know anything about the runaway?
{4277}{4356}- I don't think so.|- Tell him we'll see him later.
{4358}{4429}- How far to the bridge?|- Twenty-five minutes.
{4431}{4465}Shit.
{4576}{4627}- Seneca Station.|- Go ahead.
{4629}{4692}This is MacDonald at Central Control.|There's a runaway coming your way.
{4693}{4760}- It's going over 80.|- That's too fast for the bridge.
{4762}{4856}I know it's too fast.|Have your emergency crew together.
{4857}{4929}- Christ, can't you stop it?|- We're going to stop it.
{4931}{4979}Have them there just in case.
{5005}{5044}Asshole.
{5349}{5397}It won't do a thing.
{5449}{5518}- I tried it from the second engine.|- Why not?
{5520}{5600}I'm no expert. All I know is|when engines are hooked together...
{5602}{5649}everything operates|from the lead engine.
{5650}{5698}Stop the lead engine,|they all stop.
{5810}{5859}I don't believe this shit!
{5861}{5974}We get out of a maximum-security prison|and wind up on an unmanned train...
{5976}{6032}with this bitch and bad news.
{6034}{6120}- You guys bust out of Stonehaven?|- Yeah, so what?
{6121}{6219}- Man! Why'd you tell her that?|- You told her, clown.
{6245}{6330}What difference does it make?|She going to drop a dime on us?
{6362}{6413}I guess you guys|picked the wrong train.
{6569}{6662}How come you didn't go up|to the lead engine?
{6681}{6731}You can't cross from the second|to the first engine.
{6733}{6797}It's a streamliner.|It doesn't have a walkway.
{6799}{6884}I tried a door in front, but it must|have jammed during the collision.
{6885}{6921}Oh, man.
{6947}{7020}- What do we do now?|- Think they know about us?
{7041}{7128}They do now,|after we hit that caboose.
{7153}{7212}If they woke up,|there'll be all kinds of pigs...
{7214}{7282}all over this thing whenever|and wherever it stops.
{7284}{7394}- Ranken's all over this territory.|- Maybe he'll find us.
{7532}{7608}I ain't giving up.|No matter who has to die.
{7609}{7714}- I ain't giving them that pleasure.|- I don't want to die.
{7742}{7806}I ain't getting caught alive.
{7917}{7978}And you neither.
{8013}{8051}I don't know.
{8089}{8188}I don't know nothing right now.|I can't even think straight.
{8330}{8395}Just do what I tell you|and don't crap on yourself.
{8421}{8530}I let you tag along to be|a regular, not a piece of shit.
{9184}{9239}What you're doing ain't nothing.
{9241}{9335}We don't stand a chance|if we jump out there.
{9337}{9429}I can't jump here.|This is suicide.
{9431}{9508}You'll break every bone|in your body and then what?
{9534}{9622}- They've been broke before.|- I'm with you.
{9624}{9672}I'm with you till|the wheels come off.
{9800}{9839}You can't go.
{9841}{9914}- You can't leave me alone here.|- I don't care who jumps with me.
{9976}{10022}I know how to stop the train!
{10100}{10167}Why didn't you tell us that|to start with, goddamn it?
{10169}{10248}We probably can't stop it 100 ,|but we can slow it down.
{10250}{10291}You tell me how.
{10293}{10410}If we can disconnect the electric|cables between the engines...
{10412}{10471}the engines will shut down|one at a time.
{10473}{10532}It's not going to be easy.
{10560}{10633}They'll all be frozen solid|and we don't have the right tools.
{10635}{10682}It's a better chance|than jumping now.
{10730}{10777}You better know what|you're talking about.
{10847}{10941}Look, don't threaten me.|What's the matter with you?
{10987}{11033}Come on. Let's go.
{11317}{11359}That one.
{11361}{11417}The one next to the tow brake?
{11419}{11477}Yeah. Here.
{12120}{12154}Pull me up!
{12273}{12372}- You do it. You have two hands.|- Okay, hold onto me.
{12393}{12427}Use the wrench.
{13356}{13409}Hey, I did it!|I got it!
{13411}{13445}Get me up!
{13599}{13648}Come here! Look at this!
{13650}{13718}- Look at what?|- The runaway. It slowed down!
{13744}{13840}- It's at 80 and holding.|- It was 92 a couple minutes ago.
{13842}{13916}- I don't understand it.|- The girl. Somehow she slowed it.
{13918}{14026}It doesn't matter-- eight, 180--|the bridge won't take it.
{14028}{14108}- How far to the bridge now?|- Five minutes.
{14593}{14636}- Let's go.|- Right.
{14638}{14688}We can use|the fire extinguisher.
{15586}{15622}I lost it!
{15707}{15794}She's coming!|E.T.A.'s in about three minutes!
{15996}{16029}Get me up!
{16195}{16245}Get her, man. Get her!
{16405}{16450}Grab my hand.
{17516}{17571}Look, Manny, look!
{17835}{17881}Get me Central Control. Quick!
{18405}{18439}- It's crazy.|- What?
{18441}{18504}There are three people|on the runaway.
{18505}{18568}Holy shit.|Where they come from?
{18569}{18660}How do I know?|We just saved three lives.
{18662}{18746}- Not for long.|- Dave, give me a fucking break.
{18748}{18840}I wish I could, but we got|five minutes to get the runaway...
{18841}{18934}off the main line, or else it's going|head-on with the Northeast Express.
{18936}{19007}No big deal.|We'll just head her into the 14.
{19009}{19074}Great idea. Why don't you|just send her to Elkins?
{19076}{19154}- So?|- No, that's the chemical plant.
{19156}{19222}- She'll never make the curve.|- She'll wipe out the whole plant.
{19224}{19287}There'll be toxic chemicals|from here to Kansas.
{19289}{19337}Better warn them.
{19861}{19955}You know, girl,|I ought to thank you.
{19957}{20078}It's one thing to jump,|wrap yourself around a tree or a pole.
{20080}{20153}But to wind up|spilt all over a ditch...
{20155}{20211}with a broken hip,|waiting for the bulls--
{20241}{20285}What a waste.
{20353}{20404}Yeah, man. You ain't kidding.
{20461}{20558}Look, we're almost there.|Come on, Manny.
{20560}{20636}- Let's rip this fucker!|- Is that the door?
{20637}{20738}- It's jammed. I couldn't open it.|- Don't worry, sweetheart.
{20740}{20809}We been breaking through doors|all our lives.
{20954}{21054}Come on, let me in there.|Let me help.
{21297}{21350}- Let me in there.|- I got it!
{21388}{21434}You can't do it with|that hand of yours.
{21665}{21699}Shit.
{22088}{22182}- Take the first west at McKessburg.|- Get onto the Bell Port siding.
{22184}{22251}Get the emergency crew ready|and evacuate the plant immediately.
{22253}{22317}Get them as far away|from the plant as possible.
{22319}{22359}You got 10 minutes if you're lucky.|Get off my back, woman!
{22361}{22448}Get off my back, woman!
{22450}{22551}Mr. Barstow, I have two very dangerous|prisoners on the loose.
{22553}{22608}I don't give a shit if your|whole prison's on the loose.
{22610}{22683}I got a killer train on my hands|with three people on board...
{22685}{22748}and I got no free tracks|left to play with.
{22750}{22840}Do me a favor and get lost or I'm going|to have ass kicked out of here!
{22842}{22877}On the double!
{22977}{23027}You keep an eye on her.|I'm going to take a leak.
{23029}{23063}Do that.
{23695}{23769}Hope you don't like it|and want to do something about it.
{23853}{23937}I didn't think you wanted to|back up that loud conversation.
{24131}{24181}Wipe that piss off your face...
{24183}{24253}and I don't want to hear|any more crap out of you.
{24279}{24362}If I don't get my convicts back,|the prison will be out of control.
{24385}{24512}You know what a riot in a maximum|security prison looks like?
{24667}{24732}Your brains are too small|to imagine it.
{24757}{24813}- Now, where's the train?|- Track one.
{24815}{24880}I'm gonna kick your teeth in,|you're playing with me.
{24881}{24932}You tell me real straight,|got it?
{24933}{24987}You tell me how to find|that train with a helicopter.
{25026}{25060}I'll show you.
{26973}{27043}I'll be goddamned|if I come all this way...
{27045}{27104}to get stopped|by some goddamned door!
{27106}{27167}- Shit!|- Don't give up now.
{27169}{27236}- We're gonna make it through this.|- How?
{27343}{27377}I don't know.
{27418}{27516}But I know that people|are clearing the tracks.
{27518}{27576}And I know they won't abandon us.
{27707}{27807}- How do you know that?|- I just feel it in my heart.
{27809}{27863}There are miracles.
{27865}{27960}You're stupid. You know how stupid|you sound? Miracle, my ass!
{27962}{28066}One must count on oneself,|nobody else.
{28068}{28172}You think I'm waiting around|for a miracle to happen?
{28174}{28242}I'm going out and around.
{28244}{28296}I'm going there.|That's where I'm going!
{28348}{28396}You can't make it.|I told you...
{28398}{28438}there's nothing to hold on to.
{28440}{28518}There's no walkways.|I told you, you can't make it !
{28644}{28753}I'll make it. If I have to|fly the five feet like a birdie.
{28755}{28817}I'll fly it.|I'll make it.
{28865}{28942}Manny, you can't do it.|Not with that arm of yours.
{28944}{29038}But I can do it.|I can whip this fucker.
{29058}{29154}So, give me a drink.|Let me go for it.
{29190}{29249}- All right.|- Hey, sucker!
{29250}{29284}Lighten up.
{29449}{29505}- You are so brave.|- Yeah, I know it.
{29675}{29710}Goggles.
{29769}{29844}I'm going. Here I go.
{30149}{30204}Partners? Yeah.
{30314}{30349}Fucking A.
{30766}{30819}You can make it!
{30821}{30868}Fuck, you got guts, kid!
{31022}{31100}You got real guts.|More guts than brains.
{31101}{31176}- What did you say?|- No brains!
{31178}{31249}- That's mean!|- That's the truth.
{31435}{31512}Come on, Buck.|Let's go, sucker.
{32065}{32121}Make it now! Jump for it!
{32123}{32171}- He's got to come back.|- Go for it!
{32173}{32249}- I can't watch this.|- Then sit down!
{32403}{32449}Don't give up on me!
{32663}{32720}Come on! Come on!
{32833}{32883}Go get the--
{32885}{32948}Don't quit!|Get out there!
{33016}{33075}He can't do it!|Don't you care about him?
{33077}{33160}- Does his life mean anything to you?|- Get out of here!
{33299}{33335}Get back, punk!
{33337}{33425}You want to be a tough guy?|You want to be a legend? Go back!
{33488}{33522}Let him in!
{33677}{33734}- What are you doing, Manny?|- Get the fuck up!
{33736}{33790}Show me you ain't got|shit for blood.
{33792}{33824}Give me a break.
{33857}{33892}Get out there!
{33933}{33984}Don't you talk to me!
{33986}{34068}I don't know who you are.|You want to be a tough guy?
{34069}{34122}Get the fuck out of here!
{34157}{34204}- Stop it!|- You want to kill me?
{34205}{34281}If I'd wanted to punch your ticket,|you'd be long gone.
{34283}{34341}I'm telling you,|you can do it!
{34343}{34408}I can't do it, Manny.
{34428}{34528}You don't know what you|could do or what you can't.
{34529}{34600}You're a coward! Why'd I break out|with this chickenshit?
{34601}{34637}Leave him alone!
{34688}{34742}- Get the fuck up! You hear me?|- Stop it!
{34845}{34917}- Get the fuck out here!|- Okay!
{35137}{35218}No! He's using you!|Don't go!
{35220}{35276}You're gonna do what|I tell you, aren't you?
{35278}{35360}- That's right! You're gonna do it!|- Do it yourself if you're so brave!
{35361}{35426}- I would if I had two hands.|- Bullshit!
{35428}{35517}You think you can sacrifice|someone else's life?
{35519}{35553}You're an animal!
{35595}{35689}No, worse. Human.
{35764}{35828}Get the fuck out of here.|Go! Get the hell out of here!
{35908}{35979}I'm not letting you go!
{36024}{36070}Don't you touch her!
{36253}{36298}I'll kill you, Manny!
{36300}{36346}You die, sucker!
{36374}{36420}Don't make me kill you.
{36816}{36885}I'll beat you to fucking death!
{36887}{36933}Come on, try me!
{36985}{37033}Kill him!
{38749}{38809}I thought you was my friend.
{38859}{38919}I thought we was partners.
{38982}{39064}Shit. You know...
{39065}{39156}you're worse than Ranken,|when the truth comes out.
{39158}{39231}At least he's up front|with his bullshit.
{39298}{39356}You was a hero.
{39421}{39475}You was a hero...
{39477}{39565}to all of us|back in that shithole.
{39567}{39601}Goddamn.
{40246}{40346}It's your mess, Frank. You should've|listened to me and derailed her.
{40348}{40419}So what do we do?|We shunt them onto the siding...
{40421}{40496}and in 15 minutes|they run out of track.
{40497}{40563}- Elkins Station!|- Elkins, go ahead.
{40565}{40663}- Gilchrist, this is MacDonald.|- Yes, MacDonald.
{40665}{40704}- Barstow here.|- Come on!
{40705}{40752}Listen carefully and act fast.
{40753}{40823}You have about one minute to line|the runaway under the old spur...
{40825}{40876}- the one we don't use anymore.|- You got it.
{40877}{40925}- All right, go.|- Good, good!
{40927}{41015}Good boy! We'll save|the chemical plant, huh?
{41082}{41141}We're still going to lose|those three people.
{44121}{44188}I still don't understand.
{44190}{44321}How did this happen? Why couldn't|we stop it with all this junk?
{44361}{44420}I mean, with all this|high technology?
{44564}{44622}Some things can't be explained.
{46931}{46965}Look!
{47816}{47848}Holy shit!
{48023}{48096}See that Ranken?|Did you see that?
{48200}{48234}Come on, Ranken!
{49686}{49736}You'll never take me back!
{49738}{49784}Try it!
{49786}{49837}You'll never get me alive!
{49839}{49897}What's the matter?|You got no fucking guts?
{49899}{49940}Come on!
{49977}{50073}You hear me?|You'll never stop this train!
{50217}{50268}I told you I'd break free!
{50269}{50360}Here I am, right in your face.|Come on down!
{50362}{50408}I won! I won!
{50498}{50585}Here I am!|I'm alive, sucker!
{50692}{50746}You hear me?
{50748}{50787}You'll never get me!
{50789}{50849}You'll never stop this train.|Never!
{50851}{50888}You understand?|I won!
{51732}{51765}What was that?
{51865}{51898}What happened?
{51900}{51964}They gave up on us.
{51965}{52033}They switched us onto|a dead-end track.
{52035}{52116}- What does that mean?|- We're going to crash.
{52765}{52799}Hold me.
{52861}{52911}I don't want to die alone.
{52959}{53031}We going to be all right.|We going to be fine.
{53033}{53100}We all die alone.|Come on, Ranken!
{53133}{53218}Here I am!|I'm out of my cage now!
{53289}{53342}I'm never going back.
{53344}{53420}You'll never stop me!|Never! I'm out. You hear me?
{53421}{53502}You can't get across, Manny.
{53504}{53574}I'm out of my cage.|You'll never stop me.
{53698}{53764}You're gonna learn, kid.
{53765}{53812}It's all up here.
{53845}{53893}I'll cross the stinking thing.
{54017}{54049}Watch me.
{58348}{58385}Waiting for you.
{59429}{59479}Is Jonah alive?
{59705}{59806}That's good.|He'll be glad.
{60318}{60442}Don't do it, Manny.|You'll burn for it. You know you will.
{60501}{60584}Push the button.|We're on a dead-end siding.
{60585}{60641}We're gonna crash|in five minutes.
{60765}{60845}Then we'll have a nice|five-minute ride together.
