{2582}{2647}We've got men arranged|in ages from 14 to 19.
{2649}{2724}Unfortunately, all were killed|in the subsequent crash of the plane...
{2726}{2805}and their names are being withheld|until notification of next of kin.
{2806}{2880}We switch now to our live action|reporter at the federal courthouse...
{2881}{2977}with the latest on|the Manheim-Stonehaven prison case.
{2979}{3029}We've just gotten word|that the federal judge...
{3031}{3067}has issued his opinion.
{3069}{3132}We don't have|all the details...
{3133}{3213}but apparently Oscar Manheim,|the notorious life-term prisoner...
{3215}{3268}who has been welded in his cell|for three years...
{3269}{3311}has won|his civil rights suit...
{3313}{3367}against officials at Stonehaven.
{3369}{3401}Stay with us for details.
{3403}{3443}In a few minutes|we'll be back with comment...
{3445}{3480}from Associate Warden Ranken.
{3482}{3532}Yeah!|I say yeah!
{3848}{3891}Hey, Rogers.
{3893}{3941}Rogers, lookee here, man.
{3943}{3996}- What's up?|- Manny's won his case.
{3997}{4060}The courts ordered|to let him out of the hole.
{4061}{4160}- Great. That's great.|- Yeah. Uh, Warden Ranken...
{4162}{4197}is gonna be on the tube soon.
{4199}{4265}Let the dudes in the cell blocks|hear him talk that shit he talks.
{4267}{4337}Put channel nine|into the speakers, man.
{4477}{4533}Hey, you got shit in your veins|or what, man?
{4573}{4630}I was holding|my mud around here...
{4632}{4725}when you were peeing|in your diapers.
{4727}{4815}- All right. They'll all hear it.|- Fucking A, man!
{4838}{4911}I say, Rogers--|Thanks, man. Yeah!
{4913}{5008}Nobody wants prison to be a playground.|We all want criminals punished...
{5010}{5068}but don't you think you shocked|the public conscience...
{5069}{5164}by keeping a man welded|in a cell for three years?
{5196}{5292}Well, a man, yes,|but Manheim is an animal.
{5293}{5346}He broke out of here twice,|he's robbed banks...
{5348}{5405}he-- he's a killer.
{5406}{5475}He doesn't care about your life,|my life...
{5477}{5528}or even his own life.
{5529}{5576}Fuck your mother!
{5602}{5647}Hear that trash, Ranken!
{5649}{5695}Fat-faced faggot!
{5697}{5760}Somebody shoot|that pansy vegetable!
{5762}{5797}Manny for president!
{5836}{5905}He believes in nothing.|He's capable of anything.
{5930}{5976}I've worked in prisons|for 26 years.
{5977}{6039}Cons with strings of murders|are all afraid of Manheim.
{6041}{6126}Jesus Henry Christ!|Yeah!
{6128}{6162}Burn it!
{6383}{6429}Hey, Jonah!
{6529}{6571}- Man, he did it, man.|- Yeah.
{6573}{6618}He really fucking did it!
{6620}{6697}Yeah. That's good, man.|I'll see you in the yard.
{6763}{6813}Well, if, as you say,|he is an animal...
{6815}{6912}then why do all the other|prisoners love him so much?
{6914}{6949}Well, um...
{6950}{7047}because they're mostly animals|just like he is.
{7049}{7109}They wanna do whatever they want,|no holds barred.
{7111}{7168}- Rogers, crack that door!|- Fuck you...
{7169}{7213}and the horse|you rode in on!
{7215}{7275}Open this goddamn door!
{7408}{7483}This is no country club,|you know what I mean?
{7485}{7541}Stonehaven's average sentence|is 22 years.
{7683}{7720}Turn that fucker off!
{9105}{9151}Hey, Manny!|We got visitors!
{9689}{9724}On your feet, convict.
{9816}{9850}On your feet.
{10146}{10212}I've got a federal court order|to let you out of the hole.
{10213}{10288}I could ask for a stay|during the appeal.
{10314}{10410}I can last nine more months.
{10412}{10483}I could stand on my head|nine months.
{10485}{10601}- How about I kick your brains in?|- Fuck you. Do it alone.
{10627}{10685}I don't dirty my hands|on scum like you.
{10768}{10837}I'm gonna let you out|in the yard.
{10838}{10938}And I hope you make a move so I can|stop your clock. That's a promise.
{10940}{11055}Yeah, a promise. You promised to keep me|in this hole the rest of my life.
{11069}{11160}Kept you in here for three years.|That's long enough for me, kid.

{45616}{45661}There's my limousine|to Broadway right there.
{45663}{45698}Why?
{45743}{45777}Why that one?
{45804}{45837}Because I want it.
{49053}{49114}We're moving, man.
{49116}{49175}Thank you, Jesus.|Shit.
{49201}{49264}Shit, we make|a hell of a team, don't we, man?
{49309}{49347}Don't we?
{50463}{50521}Hey, that looks like Al's train!
{50523}{50569}What in hell|is he doing out there?
{50570}{50625}He looks sick! Damn!
{50627}{50662}Damn! AI!
{50725}{50772}Better call the paramedics.
{51022}{51057}Something's wrong.
{51069}{51112}Take it easy, Manny.
{51113}{51157}They know|what they're doing.
{51233}{51277}Pulasky!|Hello, Pulasky!
{51278}{51320}- Pulasky.|- This is Cassidy.
{51321}{51374}Al fell off the engine.|He's dead.
{51376}{51440}You've got a runaway|coming your way on track two!
{51441}{51492}- What did you say?|- Four units.
{51493}{51579}Stop them, for God's sakes!
{51581}{51622}Switch it to track 11.
{51624}{51691}I can't!|It's too late!
{51784}{51853}Central.|Damn you, Central!
{51878}{51930}Emergency!
{51932}{51971}Pick up the goddamn phone!
{52050}{52137}Ooh, boy, would I like to have|some of this here for dessert!
{52139}{52206}To go. Hey, Ruby.|Why don't you answer the phone?
{52235}{52293}Hey, come on, Ruby!|You pretty enough.
{52337}{52436}Oh, shit. Your ass is so lazy, I don't|know why the fuck you got a job here.
{52462}{52506}Uh, yeah. Central,|Dave Prince speaking.
{52508}{52570}- This is Pulasky. Give me Barstow.|- Yeah. Hold it, Pulasky.
{52572}{52633}Hold it, my ass!|Where the hell is Barstow?
{52635}{52684}We got an emergency!|A big emergency!
{52686}{52741}- We got four unmanned units!|- What?
{52743}{52843}I said we got runaway units!|Four of them! They're headed this way!
{52869}{52992}Ruby, go get Frank now. Run!|Come on! Goddamn it, get moving now!
{52994}{53039}We got an emergency here!
{53065}{53140}Hold it, Pulasky, okay?|He's coming.
{53167}{53201}It's the phone, Franky.
{53365}{53435}Frank, get your ass out here, man.|We've got a runaway on 11!
{53556}{53603}Central, where are you?|Goddamn it!
{53605}{53649}I'm here, Pulasky.|What seems to be the trouble?
{53650}{53743}We got a runaway on track 11.|Goddamn engineer fell off the train!
{53745}{53815}- You sure nobody else is on board?|- How the hell do I know?
{53817}{53864}It's already gone about nine miles,|and it's increasing speed!
{53866}{53913}- Nine miles already!|- That's right!
{53915}{53964}- What the hell are we gonna do?|- Hey, look! Be quiet!
{53965}{54016}- Will you calm down?|- Okay.
{54017}{54108}Look, I want you to line her|on the main line on track one.
{54109}{54144}- Okay.|- You got it?
{54145}{54193}- Right.|- I'll take things over from there.
{54194}{54229}Right, Frank.
{54801}{54842}Shit!
{55361}{55416}This sucker is flying, Manny.
{55417}{55474}We should have hooked|into those freight cars by now.
{55476}{55533}Smile, man.|We're free. Yeah!
{55559}{55593}You think so, huh?
{55595}{55653}Yeah.
{55843}{55944}Hey, Manny. I want you to know I'm proud|to be hooked up with you, partner.
{55982}{56017}Look, kid.
{56018}{56101}I appreciate what you done,|but you ain't no kind of partner to me.
{56103}{56139}Don't be clowning yourself.|I don't like it.
{56141}{56192}Look at them tattoos.|They'll look really nice...
{56194}{56241}in a swimming pool|in Acapulco.
{56361}{56423}What did I do to deserve all this shit|you're slinging at me, man?
{56425}{56496}You don't know nothing from nothing.|Being around me is really stupid.
{56498}{56567}I'm at war with the world|and everybody in it.
{56569}{56620}And you're gonna get hurt.
{56704}{56775}- I don't get you, man.|- Well, rapos usually are pretty dumb.
{56777}{56839}Rapo!|I ain't no goddamn rapo, man!
{56841}{56880}Where'd you get that from?
{56882}{56953}It's on your rap sheet.|Busted for rape two years ago.
{56972}{57017}Shit, man!
{57055}{57115}That was a statutory rape.
{57117}{57197}She was 15|and I was older than her.
{57198}{57236}That's good.
{57363}{57416}What's wrong with you?|You dying for company?
{57417}{57512}What? You expect somebody|to be watching or something?
{57514}{57565}I expect nothing.
{57720}{57799}She's gaining speed real fast.|She'll hit your territory in no time.
{57801}{57892}- The brakes are burning up.|- Are you nuts?
{57936}{58008}- The brakes on the runaway burnt off.|- How in the fuck did that happen?
{58010}{58058}Didn't they check it?
{58060}{58116}The throttle must be jammed|wide open in run eight.
{58117}{58152}Oh, damn!
{58189}{58274}- There she goes.|- Oh, God, man. What are we gonna do?
{58290}{58384}I got a wife and two kids, man. I ain't|got no money like Michael Jackson.
{58385}{58448}- Calm down. The system is foolproof.|- I need money. Shit!
{58449}{58496}Why? Because you designed it?
{58497}{58549}That I did, my boy.|And I know how to use it.
{58551}{58601}Now let me show you.
{59424}{59481}We'd better fly|over the highway.
{59483}{59527}Are you serious?
{59529}{59588}Jesus, those scum|could never make it this far out.
{59589}{59641}We're up here freezing our asses off|for nothing.
{59643}{59720}Hey, shut your mouth|and keep your eyes on the glacier.
{59721}{59794}This guy--|I'm telling you.
{59796}{59849}He'd do the same thing|I would do.
{60529}{60614}Hey, I just thought about that bank|that you ripped off in Reno.
{60659}{60754}I was in reform school.|Man, that was so fucking great.
{60756}{60826}Two million simoleons.|Man, that was hot.
{60828}{60907}Two million|is a slight exaggeration.
{60909}{60985}The insurance company--|standard procedure.
{60987}{61093}Yeah, but it was still fucking great,|man. Tell you what--
{61265}{61345}I know this jug outside Frisco--
{61346}{61381}good for half a million.
{61383}{61494}They had a payroll for S&H Sugar,|and S&H Sugar is a big outfit, man.
{61537}{61589}Yeah, that's what I've been|dreaming about.
{61591}{61664}A really good score,|you know what I mean?
{61685}{61732}And I'm gonna party.
{61734}{61805}Yeah. Shit, I'm gonna go|to Mardi Gras.
{61806}{61896}I'm gonna go to Vegas, and I'm gonna go|with enough money in my hip pocket...
{61897}{61960}to catch 'em fine bitches,|you know what I mean?
{61973}{62068}You know, I've spent|almost every night of my life...
{62070}{62119}dreaming about|this kind of shit.
{62121}{62182}- Dreaming?|- Yeah.
{62203}{62237}Dreaming.
{62259}{62293}That's bullshit.
{62329}{62382}You're not gonna do|nothing like that.
{62384}{62440}I'll tell you|what you're gonna do!
{62441}{62506}You're gonna get a job.|That's what you're gonna do.
{62508}{62584}You're gonna get a little job--|some job a convict can get...
{62585}{62676}Iike scraping off trays at a cafeteria|or cleaning out toilets.
{62677}{62726}And you're gonna hold on|to that job like gold...
{62728}{62774}because it is gold!
{62776}{62821}Let me tell you, Jack.|That is gold.
{62823}{62878}You listening to me?
{62917}{63000}And when that man walks in|at the end of the day...
{63002}{63052}and he comes to see|how you done...
{63054}{63115}you ain't gonna look|in his eyes.
{63117}{63163}You're gonna look at the floor...
{63165}{63215}because you don't wanna see|that fear in his eyes...
{63217}{63311}when you jump up and grab his face|and slam him to the floor...
{63313}{63371}and make him scream|and cry for his life.
{63373}{63465}So you look right at the floor, Jack.|Pay attention to this, motherfucker.
{63486}{63540}And then he's gonna look around|the room-- see how you done.
{63541}{63620}And he's gonna say, "Oh, you missed|a little spot over there.
{63621}{63739}Jeez, you didn't get this one here.|What about this little bitty spot?"
{63741}{63809}And you're gonna suck|all that pain inside you...
{63811}{63876}and you're gonna clean|that spot.
{63877}{63964}And you're gonna clean|that spot...
{63965}{64036}until you get|that shining clean.
{64061}{64144}And on Friday,|you'll pick up your paycheck.
{64146}{64196}And if you could do that...
{64197}{64282}you could be president|of Chase Manhattan-- corporations.
{64301}{64349}If you could do that.
{64367}{64401}Not me, man.
{64403}{64484}I wouldn't do that kind of shit.|I'd rather be in jail.
{64561}{64644}More's the pity, youngster.|More the pity.
{64646}{64700}Could you do|that kind of shit?
{64813}{64866}I wish I could.
{65048}{65094}I wish I could.
{66404}{66469}Central, Central.|Eastbound 12...
{66471}{66506}eastbound 12.
{66508}{66542}Barstow here.
{66544}{66643}- Why did you stop us?|- There's a runaway coming at you.
{66645}{66724}Hear me?|Number 12, answer me!
{66725}{66782}I don't see any runaway.
{66784}{66854}If you were close enough to see her,|you'd be dead. Get it?
{66856}{66902}She's about four miles away.
{66904}{66954}Now I want you to pull|onto track two at once.
{66956}{67024}- Repeat, at once.|- Oh, my God!
{67052}{67137}- No. Are you serious?|- Hey, Ruby. What's going on?
{67139}{67209}- Hey, you can't go in there right now.|- Come on, Ruby.
{67878}{67932}That eastbound 12 is crawling.
{67933}{68020}Who's the incompetent bastard on her?|He better get in the clear fast!
{69714}{69749}Oh, man.
{69832}{69883}Oh, Manny.
{69885}{69932}- Oh, man.|- I told you. Didn't I tell you?
{69933}{69981}I told you something|was fucked up.
{69982}{70053}- Maybe we're on some express run.|- Wake up, wacko!
{70055}{70126}We just blew the caboose to hell|without even slowing down!
{70128}{70186}Something screwy|is going on here. Look!
{70188}{70264}Look! All the handrails are gone!|Maybe the engineer has croaked.
{70265}{70330}Hey, man.|Engineers do not just croak!
{70332}{70402}Why don't the whistle|ever blow, huh?
{70447}{70508}What are you,|out of your mind?
{70510}{70593}I just wanted to see if it worked.|You said the engineer was croaked.
{70659}{70705}Let go.
{70751}{70800}You think this is some cops|and robbers game.
{70802}{70873}Hey, man.|You picked the train!
{70926}{70980}- You're right.|- Yeah.
{71377}{71451}State police|calling Chopper One.
{71453}{71522}Come in, please.
{71524}{71581}We have information|regarding escaped prisoners.
{71583}{71629}Ranken, that's your radio.
{71680}{71767}Railroad security called. They found|some prison clothes in a switch yard.
{71769}{71824}Looks like prisoner Logan's.
{71826}{71920}- How'd they get so far?|- What did I tell you?
{71921}{71968}Tell 'em I'll be there|in ten minutes.
{71969}{72018}Have some officers ready.
{72020}{72096}Roger, state police.|We're on our way.
{72098}{72145}Let's have some fun.
{72733}{72804}Maybe we just ought to|clear out of here.
{72806}{72877}I mean, maybe we ought to|just jump for it. What do you say?
{72981}{73046}We can break our necks|any time we want.
{73164}{73215}Yeah, that makes sense.
{73217}{73307}- Let's find out what's happening.|- How are we gonna do that?
{73309}{73362}- Go up front and find out.|- Yeah.
{73364}{73430}Find out what's happening.
{73432}{73490}Go up front and find out|what the hell is going on.
{73647}{73693}I want that, man.
{73873}{73907}For what?
{73921}{73972}Tuck that in on you someplace.
{73974}{74009}All right.
{74010}{74094}And wait till I give you|the signal before you attack.
{74108}{74145}Yeah.
{74349}{74418}Hello, Mr. MacDonald.
{74420}{74480}Don't tell anyone|about the runaway.
{74482}{74530}We don't want|to panic the passengers.
{74532}{74589}Besides, we've got the company's|reputation to uphold.
{74591}{74632}What's the latest|on that train?
{74634}{74705}It went straight through|the caboose at Granville 12.
{74773}{74836}Well, anyone hurt?
{74837}{74888}Nobody. What's the story|on the engineer?
{74890}{74940}He had a heart attack.|Old fart.
{74941}{75009}He made everyone bananas trying to keep|that engine from going to scrap.
{75011}{75075}Get that.|What's the speed?
{75077}{75112}About 70.
{75138}{75197}Hey, Barstow.|Why don't you stop her?
{75221}{75257}You put the system in.
{75259}{75346}- Cost the company 4.5 million.|- Listen, Eddie...
{75348}{75424}it's designed for the efficient|dispatching of trains when manned...
{75426}{75464}not to stop them|when they're unmanned.
{75465}{75512}The brake shoes have burned off.|The overspeed control...
{75513}{75560}must have gotten screwed up|from the collision!
{75584}{75622}But don't worry, Eddy.
{75624}{75697}We'll do all we can|to avoid any more casualties.
{75699}{75740}You haven't forgotten|about the Seneca Bridge.
{75742}{75782}Dave, could you get us|some coffee. Come on!
{75798}{75842}- What about the bridge?|- I'm taking care of it.
{75844}{75884}- What about the bridge?|- I'd like to remind you.
{75886}{75970}- Seneca is an old bridge.|- So what? Are you gonna get the coffee?
{76013}{76131}Mr. MacDonald, by the time that runaway|reaches this bridge, it'll be doing 90.
{76133}{76197}The restriction|for that bridge is 50.
{76728}{76781}Get that runaway|on the spur in Jordan and derail her.
{76783}{76853}- Best idea, sir.|- I don't need you to tell me I'm right!
{76855}{76909}Derail that son of a bitch!|I don't care about engines!
{76911}{76974}- I don't want to lose the bridge!|- Hey, this system is designed...
{76976}{77025}so that I can get everyone|out of our way and onto the siding.
{77027}{77073}Meanwhile,|we'll think of something else.
{77075}{77144}Right now it's just four engines,|no people aboard...
{77145}{77192}and if I let you jerk off|with your system...
{77193}{77246}this wild animal's|gonna kill somebody!
{77248}{77302}You know what that'll cost|the company?
{77357}{77417}Derail her.|That's my order.
{77419}{77489}You say derail,|then we derail.
{77490}{77568}But these people are witnesses.|It's your decision, Eddy.
{77584}{77618}Yeah.
{77620}{77684}Yeah, it's my decision.
{77700}{77746}Central calling Jordan.
{77767}{77836}Signal maintainer 40.|This is an emergency.
{77837}{77922}Signal maintainer 40, acknowledge.|This is an emergency!
{77924}{77978}Central calling Jordan.
{77980}{78059}Signal maintainer 40, come in.|Where the hell are you?
{78061}{78139}- Central calling Jordan.|- Jordan.
{78141}{78215}- Signal maintainer 40 here.|- Central here.
{78217}{78299}There's an unmanned runaway|heading west on track one.
{78301}{78346}You're gonna have to line her|into the siding...
{78348}{78394}use the manual switch,|then get out of the way.
{78396}{78456}Superintendent MacDonald|wants to derail her.
{78458}{78534}- Yeah.|- You got that name? Mr. Eddy MacDonald.
{78536}{78593}I'll be goddamned.
{78595}{78629}Son of a bitch!
{79933}{79967}Hey, hear that?
{80054}{80116}Come on, Manny!
{80305}{80351}See? I told you, Manny!
{80392}{80448}I knew we had an engineer|on this sucker!
{80449}{80529}- All right, kid.|- I said blow, baby, blow!
{80861}{80920}Boy, this is gonna be something.
{81143}{81218}Signal maintainer 40 here.|Eh, Jordan.
{81220}{81300}- Central.|- Listen, did I hear you right...
{81301}{81357}that that runaway|is supposed to be unmanned?
{81359}{81439}- Yeah, that's right.|- Well, let me tell you something.
{81441}{81487}I think you're wrong.
{81571}{81641}The whistle.|The goddamn whistle's blowing!
{81658}{81735}Derailing is out!|Run, old man. Line her through!
{81787}{81846}Somebody's blowing|the goddamn whistle on that train...
{81848}{81894}and you would have killed them|just like that!
{81896}{81930}My God!
{83509}{83548}Okay, next hurdle.
{83549}{83639}Come on, big train.|I'll slap your big fat diesel ass.
{83641}{83675}Come on!
{84564}{84629}Do you like anchovies?
{84685}{84731}I don't remember having any.
{84780}{84856}If you had them,|you'd remember.
{84857}{84916}I tell you what.
{84984}{85042}- Get over here.|- What?
{85125}{85236}- I don't think he saw us.|- Okay. What do we do now?
{85237}{85272}Let him come.
{85273}{85344}When he gets two-thirds through|that door, we'll nail him.
{85405}{85454}We ain't gonna|kill him, are we?
{85520}{85581}Unless we have to.
{85583}{85634}We'll find out what's going on.
