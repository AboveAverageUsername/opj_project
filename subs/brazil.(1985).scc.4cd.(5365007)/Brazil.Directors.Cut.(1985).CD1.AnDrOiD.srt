00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:21,268
Central Services

4
00:00:21,357 --> 00:00:24,827
We do the work, you do the pleasure

5
00:00:25,637 --> 00:00:28,629
Hi, there. I want to talk to you about ducts.

6
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:31,991
Do your ducts seem old-fashioned...

7
00:00:32,437 --> 00:00:33,870
out-of-date?

8
00:00:33,997 --> 00:00:36,830
Central Services' new duct designs...

9
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:40,114
are now available
in hundreds of different colors...

10
00:00:40,197 --> 00:00:42,472
to suit your individual taste.

11
00:00:43,117 --> 00:00:47,907
Hurry now, while stocks last,
to your nearest Central Services showroom.

12
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:52,386
Designer colors
to suit your demanding taste.

13
00:01:11,997 --> 00:01:14,989
We have here
from the Ministry of Information...

14
00:01:15,077 --> 00:01:17,545
Deputy Minister Eugene Helpmann.

15
00:01:17,757 --> 00:01:19,554
Good evening, David.

16
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:23,870
What d'you believe is behind
this recent increase in terrorist bombings?

17
00:01:24,077 --> 00:01:25,795
Bad sportsmanship.

18
00:01:26,157 --> 00:01:28,193
A ruthless minority of people...

19
00:01:28,277 --> 00:01:31,986
seems to have forgotten
certain good old-fashioned virtues.

20
00:01:32,317 --> 00:01:35,548
They just can't stand seeing
the other fellow win.

21
00:01:35,677 --> 00:01:38,237
If these people would just play the game...

22
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:40,069
they'd get a lot more out of life.

23
00:01:40,157 --> 00:01:42,955
Nevertheless,
there are those who maintain...

24
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:46,586
that the Ministry of Information
has become too large and unwieldy.

25
00:01:46,677 --> 00:01:49,475
In free society,
information is the name of the game.

26
00:01:49,557 --> 00:01:51,991
You can't win the game
if you're a man short.

27
00:01:52,077 --> 00:01:56,355
The cost of it all,
seven percent of the gross national product.

28
00:01:56,437 --> 00:01:59,747
I understand this concern
on behalf of the taxpayers.

29
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:03,068
People want value for money.
That is why we always insist...

30
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:06,547
on the principle
of Information Retrieval Charges.

31
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:09,668
It's absolutely right and fair...

32
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:13,466
that those found guilty
should pay for their periods of detention...

33
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:17,789
and for the information retrieval procedures
used in their interrogation.

34
00:02:18,197 --> 00:02:21,553
Do you believe the government
is winning against terrorists?

35
00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:22,911
Oh, yes.

36
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:28,069
We're fielding all their strokes,
running all of them out...

37
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:30,990
and pretty consistently
knocking them for six.

38
00:02:33,477 --> 00:02:35,786
I'd say they're nearly out of the game.

39
00:02:42,877 --> 00:02:46,711
Have to subsidize.

40
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:50,710
Mr. Helpmann, the bombing campaign
is now in its thirteenth year.

41
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:52,555
Beginner's luck.

42
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,952
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.

43
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:59,996
Thank you, David.
And a very merry Christmas to you all.

44
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,752
"Scrooge was better than his word.

45
00:03:04,837 --> 00:03:07,670
"He did it all, and infinitely more.

46
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:10,829
"And to Tiny Tim, who did not die...

47
00:03:11,197 --> 00:03:13,665
"he became a second father.

48
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:17,796
"He became as good a friend,
in the good old world.

49
00:03:18,477 --> 00:03:20,991
"And so, as Tiny Tim observed...

50
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:24,077
"God bless us, everyone."

51
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:30,792
Are you boys
giving me the runaround?

52
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,516
Now, I have to say, "Hey, hey."

53
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:36,065
Don't throw that.
That's only for long distance.

54
00:03:37,037 --> 00:03:40,154
I'm sorry, we haven't any vacancies.
No vacancies?

55
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:41,636
We've got plenty of rooms...

56
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:54,550
Who's there?

57
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:58,990
Who is that?

58
00:03:59,797 --> 00:04:03,426
Father Christmas can't come
if we haven't got a chimney.

59
00:04:03,517 --> 00:04:04,916
You'll see.

60
00:04:52,677 --> 00:04:55,191
"I hereby inform you,
under powers entrusted to me...

61
00:04:55,277 --> 00:04:59,111

Where are you taking him?

68
00:05:20,717 --> 00:05:21,911
There.

69
00:05:23,717 --> 00:05:25,070
Thank you.

70
00:05:25,477 --> 00:05:26,910
Same again, please.

71
00:05:27,997 --> 00:05:30,227
Press harder this time. Good.

72
00:05:31,037 --> 00:05:32,789
What is this all about?

73
00:05:33,517 --> 00:05:36,350
That is your receipt for your husband.
Thank you.

74
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,951
This is my receipt for your receipt.

75
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:41,107
Mrs. Buttle, are you okay?

76
00:05:44,597 --> 00:05:47,907
We're Department of Works!
Department of Works up here.

77
00:05:48,717 --> 00:05:51,515
Careful with those bloody things.
Sure.

78
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:53,914
Don't take any notice of them.

79
00:05:53,997 --> 00:05:56,465
Don't touch me!
Why don't you just get out of here.

80
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,469
Don't you worry.
We'll have everything shipshape in a jiffy.

81
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:00,876
Nothing to worry about.

82
00:06:00,957 --> 00:06:03,676
It's Tuttle downstairs who can worry.

83
00:06:03,757 --> 00:06:06,874
Tuttle? His name's Buttle.
There must be some mistake.

84
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:09,710
Mistake? We don't make mistakes.

85
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:16,430
Bloody typical. They've gone back
to metric without telling us.

86
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:18,792
Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?

87
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:20,105
Yes...

88
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:48,506
Buttle.

89
00:07:51,557 --> 00:07:53,673
Buttle, Archibald.

90
00:08:02,157 --> 00:08:03,431
Oh, shit!

91
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:06,950
Mister...

92
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:12,310
Mr. Lowry, would you step in here, please.

93
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:49,193
Has anybody seen Lowry?

94
00:08:52,037 --> 00:08:54,756
Has anybody seen...

95
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:57,192
Sam Lowry?

96
00:09:31,277 --> 00:09:32,392
Sam.

97
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:09,754
Hello? Sam. Where are you?

98
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:11,429
Hello?
It's 11:00.

99
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:13,908
- What?
- It's 11:00.

100
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:15,670
Mr. Kurtzmann.

101
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:18,955
You're up late.

102
00:10:19,677 --> 00:10:20,951
Is it?

103
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:29,388
- The electrics here are up the spout.
- Yeah, I know.

104
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:30,910
- Yours, too?
- Yes.

105
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:35,309
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Yes, thanks. 'Bye.

106
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:37,352
This is not the only statue.

107
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,349
What's this gun for?

108
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:44,147
This one, Sister,
is a nine millimeter submachine gun...

109
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:48,025
used for close-quarter combat fighting.
Very effective weapon.

110
00:11:48,117 --> 00:11:49,948
Would you like to see it?

111
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,352
Sam!

112
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:22,226
Jack!

113
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,149
Long time no see.

114
00:12:27,557 --> 00:12:28,831
What are you doing here?

115
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:31,306
Didn't expect to see you
slumming it in Records.

116
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:33,433
- What's the problem?
- Problem? No problem.

117
00:12:33,517 --> 00:12:35,269
Everything's fine. Marvelous.

118
00:12:35,357 --> 00:12:38,474
Alison's in great shape, kids are fine.
I'm on Security Level 5...

119
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:42,186
so Mr. Helpmann relies on me
more and more. It's been a great year.

120
00:12:42,277 --> 00:12:43,505
You sound worried.

121
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:47,112
Worried? Me?
If I'm worried about anyone, Sam, it's you.

122
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:50,068
Sam, whatever happened to you?

123
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:52,307
Records...

124
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:04,186
Sam?

125
00:13:06,677 --> 00:13:09,908
Jack, it's great to see you.
I'm going to be late.

126
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:13,229
Sam, let a friend tell you
your life is going wrong.

127
00:13:13,317 --> 00:13:16,514
Records is a dead-end department.
No security that's worth a damn.

128
00:13:16,597 --> 00:13:19,794
- It's impossible to get noticed.
- I know. Wonderful.

129
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:22,152
Marvelous. Perfect.

130
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:25,309
See you, Jack.
Give my regards to Alison and the twins.

131
00:13:25,397 --> 00:13:27,194
- Triplets.
- Triplets?

132
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:29,917
God, how time flies.

133
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:35,512
A very clear delineation of picture, is it not?
Mobile.

134
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:36,866
Next!

135
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:44,151
I want to report a wrongful arrest.

136
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:47,395
You want Information Adjustments.
Different department.

137
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:50,389
I've been to Information Adjustments.
They sent me here.

138
00:13:50,477 --> 00:13:53,230
They said you have a form I need to fill out.

139
00:13:53,317 --> 00:13:55,990
- Have you got an arrest receipt?
- Yeah.

140
00:13:57,477 --> 00:13:58,990
Is it stamped?

141
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:00,871
Stamped?

142
00:14:02,757 --> 00:14:05,317
No, there's no stamp on it, you see.

143
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:09,034
I can't let you have the form
until this is stamped.

144
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:10,948
Where do I get it stamped?

145
00:14:11,037 --> 00:14:13,028
Information Adjustments.

146
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:26,716
It's nothing.

147
00:14:29,557 --> 00:14:32,947
It keeps picking up old films.
That can't be right, can it?

148
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:35,352
Perhaps the machine's on the blink.

149
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:39,032
It's not the machine. There's
a mismatch on the personnel code numbers.

150
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:43,429
Tuttle should've had £31.06
debited against his account, not Buttle.

151
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:46,315
- My God, a mistake!
- At least it's not ours.

152
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:48,514
Isn't it? Whose is it?

153
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,986
- Information Retrieval.
- Good.

154
00:14:51,077 --> 00:14:54,228
Expediting has put in
for electrical procedures in respect of...

155
00:14:54,317 --> 00:14:56,990
Buttle, Archibald, shoe-repair operative.

156
00:14:57,077 --> 00:15:01,070
But Security has invoiced Admin.
For Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer.

157
00:15:01,237 --> 00:15:04,070
What a relief. Well, finish your tea, Sam.

158
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,465
Thanks.

159
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:10,390
I don't know what I'd do
if you ever got promoted.

160
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:14,356
- God, don't worry about that.
- But if they did promote you...

161
00:15:15,677 --> 00:15:18,271
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.

162
00:15:18,357 --> 00:15:20,473
- Would you, really?
- Really.

163
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:23,468
You've been promoted.

164
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:30,308
It's your mother, isn't it?
Pulling strings again.

165
00:15:34,637 --> 00:15:38,425
Sam, it's time for you to grow up
and accept responsibility.

166
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:42,471
Your poor father would be appalled
at your lack of promotion.

167
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:46,349
Mother, I just wish
you would stop interfering.

168
00:15:46,757 --> 00:15:49,908
I don't want promotion.
I'm happy where I am.

169
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:53,194
No, you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you.

170
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:56,314
He doesn't have your brains,
but he's got the ambition.

171
00:15:56,397 --> 00:16:01,073
You haven't got the ambition. Luckily,
you've got me and the Deputy Minister.

172
00:16:01,157 --> 00:16:05,867
- Mr. Helpmann was very close to your father.
- Now please, Mrs. Lowry. Don't get upset.

173
00:16:06,037 --> 00:16:09,234
Mr. Lowry, please wait in the reception.
You're giving her wrinkles.

174
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:11,035
- You see?
- God!

175
00:16:11,277 --> 00:16:13,268
Just try and relax, Mrs. Lowry.

176
00:16:13,717 --> 00:16:16,026
I'll make you 20 years younger.

177
00:16:16,237 --> 00:16:18,671
Dr. Jaffe, you are a genius.

178
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:21,112
Would you like to be Surgeon General?

179
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:23,791
I know simply everybody.

180
00:16:23,877 --> 00:16:27,028
They won't know you
when I've finished with you.

181
00:16:28,277 --> 00:16:29,551
First...

182
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:31,873
we remove the excess derma.

183
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:38,426
Now the flaccid tissues
under the eyes and forehead.

184
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:44,911
Now, I lift...

185
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:48,146
the wrinkles and the worry lines...

186
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:51,070
right up into the wig, into the hairline.

187
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:55,035
Now the template.

188
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:59,829
Now, a bit of sticky. Comme ca!

189
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:03,793
Already she's twice as beautiful
as she was before.

190
00:17:03,877 --> 00:17:05,071
Voila!

191
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:09,196
Mr. Helpmann
was very close to your poor father.

192
00:17:09,277 --> 00:17:12,474
He was close to me. He still is.

193
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:18,316
He'll take you under his wing
when you get to Information Retrieval.

194
00:17:18,397 --> 00:17:20,228
You'll like it there.

195
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:22,871
You're not listening to me, Mother.

196
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:28,708
What the hell is this, lady?

197
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,595
It's a present for my son. Really!

198
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:35,195
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.

199
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:38,795
What on earth is it?

200
00:17:38,877 --> 00:17:41,630
Something for an executive.

201
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:48,916
Madam Lowry! You look exquisite today.
Merry Christmas.

202
00:17:48,997 --> 00:17:51,227
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.

203
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,590
- You remember my son, Samuel?
- Of course.

204
00:17:54,677 --> 00:17:56,429
We're joining Mrs. Terrain.

205
00:17:56,517 --> 00:17:58,189
Yes, they're waiting.

206
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,227
- Mother, I thought we'd be able to talk.
- We will.

207
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:11,673
Ida!
She's got what's-her-name with her.

208
00:18:13,837 --> 00:18:16,510
Well, Alma, how are you?

209
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,667
You look wonderful.

210
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:20,748
Hello, Shirley.

211
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:22,989
Thank you, Spiro.

212
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,395
- Salt?
- Not yet.

213
00:18:25,957 --> 00:18:28,517
Sam, Happy Christmas.

214
00:18:30,517 --> 00:18:32,747
So sorry we're late.
Thanks.

215
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:34,629
Now, Alma...

216
00:18:35,037 --> 00:18:36,629
what are you going to have?

217
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:40,153
I can't make up my mind whether to have
the number one or the number two.

218
00:18:40,237 --> 00:18:41,829
What do you recommend, Spiro?

219
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:43,953
Between you and me, madame...

220
00:18:44,037 --> 00:18:46,756
- today the number two.
- Thank you, Spiro.

221
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:48,907
Shirley, what are you going to have?

222
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:52,910
Between you and me, mademoiselle,
today the number one.

223
00:18:53,237 --> 00:18:54,716
Madam Lowry?

224
00:18:54,997 --> 00:18:59,070
To hell with the diet!
I'm going to have a number eight, please.

225
00:18:59,157 --> 00:19:02,115
- A most perceptive choice, if I may say so.
- Oh, Ida...

226
00:19:02,197 --> 00:19:04,267
- Monsieur?
- Steak, please, rare. Mother...

227
00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:06,917
- Monsieur, quel numero?
- I don't know which number.

228
00:19:06,997 --> 00:19:09,033
- Mother, please...
- That one. There.

229
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:10,550
Thanks. Mother, will you...

230
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:14,550
Alma! You wicked girl.
You've started your treatments.

231
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:17,197
- Say the number, please.
- You noticed.

232
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:19,592
- You have to say the number!
- Go away!

233
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:21,474
I must tell you all about it.

234
00:19:21,557 --> 00:19:23,036
Number three.

235
00:19:25,157 --> 00:19:28,786
- Mother, will you listen to me?
- Numero huit.

236
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:33,876
Braised veal in wine sauce.

237
00:19:36,277 --> 00:19:40,828
It's too exciting.
I've left Dr. Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.

238
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:43,112
Numero deux, duck a I'orange.

239
00:19:43,197 --> 00:19:45,267
Chapman?
Excusez-moi.

240
00:19:45,357 --> 00:19:47,507
The acid man?

241
00:19:47,797 --> 00:19:51,233
Really, Ida. Just because
his techniques are revolutionary.

242
00:19:51,317 --> 00:19:54,309
I don't go around calling
Dr. Jaffe the knife man.

243
00:19:54,397 --> 00:19:57,036
Numero un,
crevettes a la mayonnaise.

244
00:19:57,117 --> 00:19:58,709
I am sorry, Alma.

245
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,595
- I didn't mean to...
- It's all right, Ida.

246
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:04,271
Steak. Numero trois!

247
00:20:06,477 --> 00:20:08,229
Mesdames, monsieur...

248
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,987
bon appetit!

249
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:12,829
- Merci!
- Merci!

250
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:17,433
Acid, on the other hand, can be used
for such wonderfully subtle shading...

251
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,508
such delicate nuances.

252
00:20:19,597 --> 00:20:22,873
Like a Rembrandt etching.
And it is so much quicker.

253
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:26,745
If it wasn't for this complication,
it could've happened to anybody...

254
00:20:26,837 --> 00:20:29,795
I'd have had this dressing off yesterday.

255
00:20:30,557 --> 00:20:31,785
Shirley.

256
00:20:32,997 --> 00:20:34,112
Salt?

257
00:20:56,637 --> 00:20:57,956
What were we saying?

258
00:20:58,037 --> 00:20:59,834
God, this isn't rare.

259
00:21:00,277 --> 00:21:05,032
By the by, I saw the most wonderful idea
for Christmas presents at the chemist's.

260
00:21:05,117 --> 00:21:07,551
Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.

261
00:21:07,637 --> 00:21:09,468
That sounds marvelous!

262
00:21:09,557 --> 00:21:13,152
It's good at any doctor's
and most of the major hospitals.

263
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:16,786
It's also accepted
for gynecological examinations...

264
00:21:16,877 --> 00:21:19,107
including Caesarian sections.

265
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:21,547
- Spiro.
- Madam, I don't know what to say.

266
00:21:21,637 --> 00:21:25,676
This never happens to us. I'm going
to do something about it straightaway.

267
00:21:26,477 --> 00:21:29,992
Sam, can't you do something
about these terrorists?

268
00:21:30,077 --> 00:21:31,795
It's my lunch hour.

269
00:21:33,037 --> 00:21:34,789
Besides, it's not my department.

270
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:39,473
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things
I've been dying to tell you.

271
00:21:39,917 --> 00:21:43,705
Sam's being promoted
to Information Retrieval.

272
00:21:43,797 --> 00:21:47,676
Why, that's wonderful!
Congratulations, Sam.

273
00:21:47,877 --> 00:21:52,268
Stop it! I'm not being promoted.
I'm not going to Information Retrieval.

274
00:21:52,357 --> 00:21:55,633
If I wanted to upset you, Mother,
I'd tell you where to stick it.

275
00:21:59,197 --> 00:22:00,425
Pepper?

276
00:22:02,717 --> 00:22:04,309
I've got to go.

277
00:22:04,397 --> 00:22:06,388
You haven't had your dessert.

278
00:22:06,477 --> 00:22:09,071
I don't want dessert, promotion or anything!

279
00:22:09,157 --> 00:22:13,309
Of course you want something.
You must have hopes, wishes, dreams?

280
00:22:13,437 --> 00:22:15,667
No, nothing. Not even dreams.

281
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:27,392
Sam.

282
00:22:58,837 --> 00:22:59,952
Sam!

283
00:23:39,357 --> 00:23:40,631
Oh, God!

284
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:04,987
Hello. Central Services?

285
00:24:05,397 --> 00:24:08,116
I'm at 579B, Block 19,
Northwestern Section D.

286
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:11,314
Exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway
at the Orange Blossom Flyover.

287
00:24:11,397 --> 00:24:14,514
I've got trouble with my air conditioning.
It's an emergency.

288
00:24:14,597 --> 00:24:18,476
Thanks for calling Central
Services. I'm sorry, due to staff shortages...

289
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:22,789
Central Services cannot take service calls
between 2300 and 0900 hours.

290
00:24:22,877 --> 00:24:25,152
Have a nice day.
This has not been a recording.

291
00:24:25,237 --> 00:24:26,829
This is an emergency!

292
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:31,433
- Thank you for calling Central Services...
- Look, I've got to have a heating engineer.

293
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:34,475
- Thank you for calling Central Services.
- Oh, shit!

294
00:24:58,037 --> 00:24:59,231
Hello.

295
00:25:08,557 --> 00:25:10,229
Hello.
Hello.

296
00:25:19,597 --> 00:25:21,235
Hello, Mr. Lowry.

297
00:25:21,317 --> 00:25:22,989
Yes, who is this?

298
00:25:23,557 --> 00:25:26,435
Put the phone down and raise your hands.

299
00:25:26,837 --> 00:25:28,555
What? Who is this?

300
00:25:32,037 --> 00:25:33,789
Nice and easy, now.

301
00:25:39,637 --> 00:25:42,470
Just keep your hands where I can see them.

302
00:26:06,837 --> 00:26:08,589
What are you doing?

303
00:26:12,477 --> 00:26:15,628
Harry Tuttle, heating engineer,
at your service.

304
00:26:19,237 --> 00:26:20,465
Tuttle?

305
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:24,472
Are you from Central Services?

306
00:26:29,677 --> 00:26:31,269
I called Central Services.

307
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:33,154
They're overworked these days.

308
00:26:33,237 --> 00:26:35,671
Luckily, I intercepted your call.

309
00:26:36,557 --> 00:26:37,910
You did...

310
00:26:39,437 --> 00:26:42,315
Just a minute.
What was that business with the gun?

311
00:26:43,037 --> 00:26:44,948
Just a precaution, sir.

312
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:49,156
I've had traps set for me before now.

313
00:26:49,597 --> 00:26:54,352
Plenty of people in Central Services would
love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.

314
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,955
Are you telling me that this is illegal?

315
00:27:04,597 --> 00:27:05,632
Well, yes and no.

316
00:27:05,717 --> 00:27:08,356
Officially, only Central Services
can touch this stuff.

317
00:27:08,437 --> 00:27:09,916
Would you hold this, please?

318
00:27:09,997 --> 00:27:12,591
But nowadays,
with all the new rules and regulations...

319
00:27:12,677 --> 00:27:14,588
they can't get decent staff anymore.

320
00:27:14,677 --> 00:27:17,191
They turn a blind eye as long as I'm careful.

321
00:27:17,277 --> 00:27:20,553
But if they could prove that I've been
working on their equipment...

322
00:27:20,637 --> 00:27:22,753
that's a plate of a different color.

323
00:27:22,837 --> 00:27:25,397
- Wouldn't it be simpler just to...
- Hold this, please.

324
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,796
Sorry, yes.

325
00:27:26,877 --> 00:27:30,187
I was saying, wouldn't it be simpler
to work with Central Services?

326
00:27:30,277 --> 00:27:32,154
I couldn't stand the...

327
00:27:33,557 --> 00:27:35,912
- It's getting warm.
- You couldn't stand the what?

328
00:27:35,997 --> 00:27:37,794
I couldn't stand the paperwork.

329
00:27:37,877 --> 00:27:38,832
Listen...

330
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:42,626
this system of yours could be on fire,
and I couldn't turn on a kitchen tap...

331
00:27:42,717 --> 00:27:45,311
without filling out a 27BI6.

332
00:27:45,637 --> 00:27:47,309
Bloody paperwork.

333
00:27:47,877 --> 00:27:50,232
I suppose one has to expect
a certain amount.

334
00:27:50,317 --> 00:27:52,911
Why? I came into this
for the action, the excitement.

335
00:27:52,997 --> 00:27:57,354
Go anywhere, travel light. Get in, get out,
wherever there's trouble. A man alone.

336
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:02,869
They've got the whole country sectioned off.
Can't make a move without a form.

337
00:28:18,077 --> 00:28:20,386
Found it. There's your problem.

338
00:28:20,637 --> 00:28:22,514
- Can you fix it?
- No, I can't.

339
00:28:22,597 --> 00:28:26,112
But I can bypass it with one of these.

340
00:28:28,477 --> 00:28:29,876
Fine by me.

341
00:28:34,597 --> 00:28:36,872
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

342
00:28:41,837 --> 00:28:43,475
Wait here. Wait.

343
00:28:49,877 --> 00:28:52,186
The flashlight.

344
00:28:55,237 --> 00:28:57,068
- Central Services.
- Central Services.

345
00:28:57,157 --> 00:29:00,069
- Yes.
- You rang, sir.

346
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:01,636
Trouble with your air conditioning?

347
00:29:02,957 --> 00:29:04,231
No, it's all right.

348
00:29:07,077 --> 00:29:08,476
It's fixed.

349
00:29:08,557 --> 00:29:09,956
It's fixed?

350
00:29:10,197 --> 00:29:13,746
Yes. I mean, it fixed itself.

351
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:15,429
Fixed itself, did it?

352
00:29:16,637 --> 00:29:17,706
Yes.

353
00:29:19,397 --> 00:29:20,876
Machines don't fix themselves.

354
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:24,709
He's tampered with it.

355
00:29:26,277 --> 00:29:28,586
Sorry you had a wasted journey.

356
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:32,272
I think we ought to have a look.

357
00:29:35,037 --> 00:29:36,914
Have you got a 27BI6?

358
00:29:36,997 --> 00:29:38,316
A 27BI6?

359
00:29:46,157 --> 00:29:48,591
Now look what you've done to him.

360
00:29:49,717 --> 00:29:51,594
Have you got a 27BI6?

361
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,868
Not as such.

362
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,555
But we'll get one.

363
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:01,192
It's all right, it's all right.

364
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:04,189
Sorry. I'm a bit of a stickler for paperwork.

365
00:30:04,277 --> 00:30:07,314
Where would we be
if we didn't stick to the correct procedures?

366
00:30:07,397 --> 00:30:08,910
We'll be back.

367
00:30:09,757 --> 00:30:11,270
We'll be back!

368
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:17,551
Thanks for coming.

369
00:30:17,637 --> 00:30:20,105
We'll be back, you clever bastard!

370
00:30:20,197 --> 00:30:22,506
Thank you.
We'll show you.

371
00:30:29,677 --> 00:30:32,987
Thanks, Lowry.
You're a good man in a tight corner.

372
00:30:41,797 --> 00:30:44,265
I just happen to work
at the Ministry of Information.

373
00:30:44,357 --> 00:30:45,346
What?

374
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:49,147
I just happen to know that...

375
00:30:49,677 --> 00:30:53,465
Information Retrieval
are looking for an Archibald Tuttle...

376
00:30:53,557 --> 00:30:55,229
heating engineer.

377
00:30:57,877 --> 00:31:00,550
You wouldn't by any chance... Would you?

378
00:31:02,877 --> 00:31:05,186
My good friends call me Harry.

379
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:08,794
Information Retrieval?

380
00:31:09,477 --> 00:31:10,956
The big boys.

381
00:31:16,197 --> 00:31:18,313
What do they want you for?

382
00:31:23,157 --> 00:31:24,556
Time to go.

383
00:31:25,157 --> 00:31:26,556
How's that?

384
00:31:31,837 --> 00:31:34,510
You really must let me give you something.

385
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,831
How much will it be for the work?

386
00:31:42,597 --> 00:31:46,112
Come on. You did me a favor.
Just check the corridor.

387
00:31:49,277 --> 00:31:50,471
Thanks.

388
00:31:50,557 --> 00:31:53,276
Listen, kid. We're all in this together.

389
00:31:53,437 --> 00:31:54,631
Go on.

390
00:32:08,277 --> 00:32:09,346
All clear.

391
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:39,955
I think Kurtzmann is getting suspicious.

392
00:32:42,717 --> 00:32:44,548
What's playing today?

393
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:46,596
Casablanca.

394
00:32:46,677 --> 00:32:49,635
Mr. Lowry, step in here, please.

395
00:32:52,757 --> 00:32:53,951
Lowry!

396
00:32:55,717 --> 00:32:57,628
Now, Mr. Lowry!

397
00:33:09,917 --> 00:33:13,034
Thank God you're here.
We're in terrible trouble.

398
00:33:20,797 --> 00:33:22,071
Look at this.

399
00:33:22,157 --> 00:33:25,035
- It's a check.
- It's the refund for Tuttle.

400
00:33:25,117 --> 00:33:26,345
Tuttle?

401
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,674
Buttle. I mean Buttle.

402
00:33:30,037 --> 00:33:32,073
It's been confusion from the word go.

403
00:33:32,157 --> 00:33:34,955
He was overcharged
for Information Retrieval procedures.

404
00:33:35,037 --> 00:33:37,835
And someone, somewhere,
is trying to make us carry the can.

405
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:41,387
Can I have a look?
I've never seen a refund check before.

406
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,433
I'll bet it's Jeffries.

407
00:33:45,277 --> 00:33:46,392
Yes.

408
00:33:46,597 --> 00:33:49,634
He believes that people
should pay more for their interrogation.

409
00:33:49,717 --> 00:33:51,673
And B: He loathes me.

410
00:33:51,837 --> 00:33:53,509
We've got to get rid of it.

411
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:56,714
Send it to somebody else.
Better still, send it to Buttle.

412
00:33:56,797 --> 00:33:58,310
After all, it's his check.

413
00:33:58,397 --> 00:34:00,627
I've tried that. Look at this.

414
00:34:00,877 --> 00:34:01,866
You see?

415
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,994
The population census
has got him down as dormanted.

416
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:08,626
The Central Collective Storehouse
computer has got him down as deleted.

417
00:34:08,717 --> 00:34:11,914
- Hang on.
- Information Retrieval's got him inoperative.

418
00:34:11,997 --> 00:34:14,557
Security has got him down as excised.

419
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:17,549
- Administration's got him as completed.
- He's dead.

420
00:34:19,597 --> 00:34:20,712
Dead?

421
00:34:23,077 --> 00:34:24,908
Well, that's awful.

422
00:34:29,157 --> 00:34:31,990
We'll never get rid
of the damn thing now.

423
00:34:32,677 --> 00:34:34,554
What are we going to do, Sam?

424
00:34:35,197 --> 00:34:37,233
Could try the next of kin.

425
00:34:44,357 --> 00:34:46,825
There we go. "Buttle, Veronica, Mrs."

426
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:48,236
Veronica?

427
00:34:49,157 --> 00:34:51,352
What's the number on the check?

428
00:34:51,437 --> 00:34:54,588
27156789...

429
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:59,993
I074328K.

430
00:35:02,877 --> 00:35:04,595
Right into memory.

431
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:07,829
Central Banking.

432
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:10,875
Veronica Buttle...

433
00:35:11,637 --> 00:35:12,752
Mrs.

434
00:35:13,837 --> 00:35:15,111
Deposit.

435
00:35:29,597 --> 00:35:31,315
Thank God for that.

436
00:35:31,557 --> 00:35:33,513
Would you like some tea?

437
00:35:43,077 --> 00:35:44,669
There's a problem.

438
00:35:44,757 --> 00:35:47,112
She doesn't have a bank account.

439
00:35:50,957 --> 00:35:52,788
Well, that's it then.

440
00:35:53,957 --> 00:35:56,869
I might just as well go
and hang myself now.

441
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:03,794
This could never have happened
before the stupid 7th tier reorganization.

442
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:05,475
That's Simmons' doing.

443
00:36:05,557 --> 00:36:07,866
He and Jeffries always sit together at lunch.

444
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,231
Bastards!

445
00:36:15,317 --> 00:36:19,276
Perhaps we could lose the thing
behind a filing cabinet or something...

446
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:22,667
- or burn it, eat it...
- Look. There is one solution.

447
00:36:22,757 --> 00:36:24,713
- What?
- Drive out to Mrs. Buttle...

448
00:36:24,797 --> 00:36:28,631
let her sign at the back of the check.
She can cash it at the corner sweet shop.

449
00:36:30,157 --> 00:36:31,988
That's brilliant, Sam.

450
00:36:32,077 --> 00:36:33,590
I'll even do it for you.

451
00:36:33,677 --> 00:36:35,907
Here, authorize the check.
What's the address?

452
00:36:35,997 --> 00:36:37,828
Everything's in here.

453
00:36:41,197 --> 00:36:43,028
What shall I do next?

454
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:46,270
Pink and blue receipts.

455
00:36:46,357 --> 00:36:49,827
Sign there, there and there.
And sign the check there.

456
00:36:55,397 --> 00:36:57,513
I think I've broken a bone.

457
00:36:57,837 --> 00:37:01,512
My wrist is all limp.
What a pathetic creature I am!

458
00:37:04,397 --> 00:37:06,149
I'll do it for you.

459
00:37:24,277 --> 00:37:26,313
Right. I'll be on my way.

460
00:37:29,077 --> 00:37:30,192
Sam?

461
00:37:33,477 --> 00:37:35,707
You are good to me, you know.

462
00:37:35,997 --> 00:37:39,353
Here's looking at you, kid.
Here's looking at you.

463
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:46,147
Brazil

464
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:50,788
Where hearts were entertained in June

465
00:37:50,997 --> 00:37:55,707
We stood beneath that amber moon

466
00:37:55,957 --> 00:37:59,791
We interrupt this program
to bring you news of a terrorist bombing...

467
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,151
at the Blue Lagoon...

468
00:38:04,197 --> 00:38:09,146
And clung together, then

469
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:14,036
Tomorrow was another day

470
00:38:16,477 --> 00:38:19,833
The morning found me miles away

471
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:24,911
With still a million things to say

472
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,554
And now

473
00:38:29,637 --> 00:38:33,994
when twilight beams the sky above

474
00:38:40,477 --> 00:38:42,786
Hello. I wonder if you could tell me where...

475
00:38:42,877 --> 00:38:44,151
Piss off!

476
00:38:48,677 --> 00:38:49,871
Hello.

477
00:38:51,557 --> 00:38:53,309
I'll never confess!

478
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:01,551
Come on,
you've got to interrogate me.

479
00:39:26,757 --> 00:39:28,190
Mrs. Buttle?

480
00:39:32,477 --> 00:39:33,910
Mrs. Buttle?

481
00:39:42,477 --> 00:39:44,229
Are you Mrs. Buttle?

482
00:39:51,197 --> 00:39:52,869
My name is Lowry.

483
00:39:54,557 --> 00:39:55,910
Sam Lowry.

484
00:39:58,637 --> 00:40:01,231
I'm from the Ministry of Information.

485
00:40:04,117 --> 00:40:06,392
I've come to give you a check.

486
00:40:11,437 --> 00:40:14,429
It's a refund, actually. There was a mistake.

487
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:16,271
Mistake?

488
00:40:16,357 --> 00:40:19,713
Yes. Not my department, of course.
I'm only Records.

489
00:40:21,757 --> 00:40:26,512
I'll tell you what it is. It seems Mr. Buttle
was overcharged by Information Retrieval.

490
00:40:27,357 --> 00:40:30,190
They don't usually make mistakes...

491
00:40:30,837 --> 00:40:32,907
but I suppose we're all human.

492
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:39,428
What happened to the...

493
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:46,396
Actually, my coming here
is rather unorthodox.

494
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:51,028
Bringing you this check. Any payments are
normally made through Central Computer...

495
00:40:51,197 --> 00:40:53,392
but as there were certain...

496
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:57,393
difficulties, we thought,
rather than cause delay...

497
00:40:57,957 --> 00:40:59,993
we'd let you have it now.

498
00:41:00,277 --> 00:41:02,472
It being Christmas and all.

499
00:41:03,437 --> 00:41:05,632
My husband's dead, isn't he?

500
00:41:08,237 --> 00:41:11,547
I do assure you, Mrs. Buttle,
the Ministry is very scrupulous...

501
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:14,310
about following up
and eradicating any error.

502
00:41:14,397 --> 00:41:16,991
But if you do have any complaints
you wish to make...

503
00:41:17,077 --> 00:41:21,036
I'd be only too happy
to send you the appropriate forms.

504
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:23,791
What have you done with his body?

505
00:41:30,477 --> 00:41:33,787
I don't know anything about that.
I'm really just...

506
00:41:33,877 --> 00:41:35,993
delivering the check. So if...

507
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:39,911
Look, if you wouldn't mind
just signing these two receipts...

508
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:44,431
I'd be only too happy to leave you in peace.

509
00:41:44,597 --> 00:41:46,588
He hadn't done anything.

510
00:41:46,997 --> 00:41:48,430
He was good!

511
00:41:49,997 --> 00:41:54,275
What have you done
with his body?

512
00:42:01,157 --> 00:42:03,671
It isn't being very helpful, is it?

513
00:42:10,877 --> 00:42:14,074
I didn't have to come here,
you know, Mrs. Buttle.

514
00:42:15,357 --> 00:42:17,427
I'll kill you, you bastard!

515
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:20,511
Stop it!

516
00:42:30,837 --> 00:42:32,555
Are you all right?

517
00:42:33,877 --> 00:42:35,595
Are you all right?

518
00:42:40,277 --> 00:42:42,108
Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?

519
00:42:42,197 --> 00:42:43,516
It's you.

520
00:42:44,237 --> 00:42:46,068
Wait, stop! Don't go!

521
00:43:55,877 --> 00:43:59,347
Stop! I had nothing to do with it. Wait!

522
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:00,586
Stop!

523
00:44:05,677 --> 00:44:07,554
He's coming back!

524
00:44:22,877 --> 00:44:25,072
- Go away.
- Her name's Jill.

525
00:44:25,957 --> 00:44:27,072
What?

526
00:44:27,437 --> 00:44:28,552
Jill?

527
00:44:29,037 --> 00:44:30,311
Jill who?

528
00:44:30,717 --> 00:44:31,991
Jill who?

529
00:44:33,117 --> 00:44:34,311
Layton.

530
00:44:36,277 --> 00:44:37,676
Jill Layton.

531
00:44:38,837 --> 00:44:41,112
You're a very good little girl.

532
00:44:41,197 --> 00:44:44,075
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for my daddy.

533
00:44:44,157 --> 00:44:46,751
He will be pleased when he gets home.

534
00:45:30,357 --> 00:45:33,508
Sam, I've just had
the transport pool onto me.

535
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:37,192
You don't know anything about a personnel
transporter gone missing, do you?

536
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:38,915
Personnel transporter?

537
00:45:38,997 --> 00:45:39,827
What?

538
00:45:40,557 --> 00:45:43,230
The pranets, I had a personal transporter.

539
00:45:43,317 --> 00:45:45,592
I'll do the paperwork in the morning.

540
00:45:46,917 --> 00:45:49,511
Is it all right about Mrs. Tuttle...

541
00:45:49,757 --> 00:45:51,588
Buttle's check?

542
00:45:52,557 --> 00:45:54,149
- Can I forget it?
- Yeah.

543
00:45:54,717 --> 00:45:57,515
What a relief. I'm gonna have nightmares.

544
00:46:01,037 --> 00:46:02,311
Damn! Blast!

545
00:46:02,837 --> 00:46:04,509
What's the matter?

546
00:46:05,237 --> 00:46:08,274
You don't happen to know
how to get round an IRQI3, do you?

547
00:46:08,997 --> 00:46:11,557
All information
on third level suspects is classified.

548
00:46:11,637 --> 00:46:15,789
All inquiries through Information Retrieval.
That's hopeless, they'll tell you nothing.

549
00:46:15,877 --> 00:46:18,869
Come the time they want something
from us, yes.

550
00:46:19,157 --> 00:46:21,352
There's one way I could get round it.

551
00:46:21,437 --> 00:46:24,031
- I could accept my mother's promotion.
- Yes.

552
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:26,552
No!

553
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:30,147
You can't. You turned it down.

554
00:46:30,557 --> 00:46:32,468
I didn't sign the form.

555
00:46:33,477 --> 00:46:35,115
I did it for you.

556
00:46:36,317 --> 00:46:38,035
- You didn't?
- I did.

557
00:46:39,317 --> 00:46:40,670
You didn't!

558
00:46:41,157 --> 00:46:42,306
I did.

559
00:46:42,557 --> 00:46:46,152
- Why did you do that?
- That's what you wanted, isn't it?

560
00:46:47,637 --> 00:46:49,070
I don't know.

561
00:46:49,757 --> 00:46:51,748
I don't know what I want.

562
00:46:53,237 --> 00:46:55,671
Come on, before they turn the lights out.

563
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:14,073
There is one way around it.

564
00:47:14,157 --> 00:47:17,354
I could accept promotion
to Information Retrieval.

565
00:47:55,757 --> 00:47:57,031
Sam.

566
00:49:30,117 --> 00:49:31,835
What are you doing?

567
00:49:32,077 --> 00:49:33,749
My God, what's going on?

568
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:35,634
Emergency procedures.

569
00:49:37,077 --> 00:49:39,147
I haven't got an emergency.

570
00:49:39,237 --> 00:49:40,909
This is an emergency.

571
00:49:40,997 --> 00:49:44,433
Have a nice day.
This has not been a recording.

572
00:49:45,677 --> 00:49:47,269
Here. Sign that.

573
00:49:48,837 --> 00:49:49,986
What is it?

574
00:49:50,077 --> 00:49:53,308
It's a 27BI6. What do you think it is?
Where is he?

575
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,987
Spoor, come here. I found it.

576
00:49:57,477 --> 00:49:59,149
Spoor, come here!

577
00:49:59,237 --> 00:50:02,627
Look there, a bypass valve
on the transformer.

578
00:50:14,917 --> 00:50:17,147
You've had that scab Tuttle here.

579
00:50:17,517 --> 00:50:19,553
What are you talking about?

580
00:50:19,637 --> 00:50:21,753
Who fixed your ducts?

581
00:50:22,677 --> 00:50:25,475
I told you before, they fixed themselves.

582
00:50:26,197 --> 00:50:29,189
Where did this come from,
out of your nostril?

583
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:35,669
Central Services.

584
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,545
They don't take kindly to sabotage.

585
00:50:44,557 --> 00:50:46,946
This place is in a terrible state.

586
00:50:47,877 --> 00:50:51,028
Just a minute. You're not gonna
leave it like this, are you?

587
00:50:51,117 --> 00:50:52,186
Why not?

588
00:50:52,277 --> 00:50:55,633
All you got to do is blow your nose
and it's fixed, isn't it?

589
00:51:32,637 --> 00:51:35,515
What have you done with his body?

590
00:54:46,028 --> 00:54:49,418
Mrs. Ida Lowry
requests the pleasure of your company

591
00:54:49,508 --> 00:54:52,306
at her apartment tonight from 8:30

592
00:54:55,308 --> 00:54:56,866
to midnight

593
00:54:57,348 --> 00:54:59,464
To celebrate the completion

594
00:54:59,548 --> 00:55:01,823
of her recent cosmetic

595
00:55:02,108 --> 00:55:04,668
surgery

596
00:55:23,308 --> 00:55:24,502
Thanks.

597
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:26,380
It's reply paid.

598
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:27,857
Is it?

599
00:55:32,108 --> 00:55:33,427
Two, three.

600
00:55:33,508 --> 00:55:37,103
Mother, I'm sorry
but I am unable to come to your party

601
00:55:37,188 --> 00:55:38,826
You don't have to sing it.

602
00:55:38,948 --> 00:55:40,176
I don't?

603
00:55:47,068 --> 00:55:49,821
Aren't you a bit late?
The party started an hour ago.

604
00:55:49,908 --> 00:55:52,581
Yes, it's backlog. Everybody complains.

605
00:55:53,148 --> 00:55:55,218
Was it all right otherwise?

606
00:56:03,988 --> 00:56:07,697
Mr. Helpmann,
I'm keen to get into Information Retrieval.

607
00:56:07,788 --> 00:56:10,746
Mr. Helpmann,
I'm dying to get at this woman.

608
00:56:20,068 --> 00:56:21,865
Where's your invitation?

609
00:56:21,948 --> 00:56:24,018
Don't shoot! Mother!

610
00:56:26,228 --> 00:56:29,459
Sam, I'm so glad you came.

611
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:31,936
Come in.

612
00:56:32,628 --> 00:56:33,822
Mother?

613
00:56:36,028 --> 00:56:38,383
Oh, God, Mother, is that you?

614
00:56:38,508 --> 00:56:41,227
Of course. Isn't it wonderful?

615
00:56:41,588 --> 00:56:44,386
The bandages came off just this afternoon.

616
00:56:44,748 --> 00:56:46,898
Come on, darling, join in the fun.

617
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:49,218
Simply everybody's here.

618
00:56:49,308 --> 00:56:52,027
- Is Mr. Helpmann here? Stop shoving!
- He is.

619
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:55,259
Mr. Helpmann is here,
and he wants to talk to you.

620
00:56:55,348 --> 00:56:57,464
Good. I want to talk to him.

621
00:56:57,548 --> 00:57:01,223
He says you're the first person
ever to refuse a promotion.

622
00:57:01,348 --> 00:57:05,102
- He thinks you should see a doctor.
- Actually, Mother, I've decided...

623
00:57:05,868 --> 00:57:07,540
Louis, you know Sam.

624
00:57:08,348 --> 00:57:10,066
Can you believe it?

625
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:12,857
It's just me and my little knife.

626
00:57:12,948 --> 00:57:14,176
Snip.

627
00:57:14,468 --> 00:57:15,617
Slice.

628
00:57:16,268 --> 00:57:18,862
- Can you believe it?
- Congratulations.

629
00:57:18,948 --> 00:57:21,416
- But this is just the beginning.
- Really?

630
00:57:21,508 --> 00:57:24,181
Of course, yes.
You've seen her with her clothes off.

631
00:57:24,268 --> 00:57:27,146
Faces are a doddle
compared to tits and ass.

632
00:57:27,348 --> 00:57:29,543
- No hairlines.
- Really, Louis!

633
00:57:31,668 --> 00:57:34,262
I've been looking for you everywhere.

634
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:41,461
Mother, I have to talk to Mr. Helpmann.

635
00:57:41,908 --> 00:57:44,058
- You stupid sod.
- Dear boy...

636
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:47,496
what do you think of your mother now?

637
00:57:47,588 --> 00:57:49,306
It will never last.

638
00:57:51,628 --> 00:57:52,947
Excuse me.

639
00:57:53,148 --> 00:57:55,218
Dr. Chapman, did you say something?

640
00:57:55,308 --> 00:57:57,538
That technique, I've tried it.

641
00:57:58,228 --> 00:58:00,947
A nice effect, but highly unstable.

642
00:58:01,628 --> 00:58:04,620
In six months,
she'll look like Grandma Moses.

643
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,866
See here, Chapman.

644
00:58:06,948 --> 00:58:10,702
At least mine don't end up looking
like they've been mugged.

645
00:58:15,548 --> 00:58:19,587
What have you done with his body?

646
00:58:23,948 --> 00:58:27,338
- What happened to you?
- There's a little complication.

647
00:58:27,428 --> 00:58:31,865
Dr. Chapman says it often happens
with a delicate skin like mine.

648
00:58:32,428 --> 00:58:34,259
Nothing to worry about.

649
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:37,624
He's promised these bandages
will be off in a jiffy.

650
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:40,984
- Actually, there's someone I want to meet.
- I know.

651
00:58:44,628 --> 00:58:46,027
Here we are.

652
00:58:47,588 --> 00:58:50,580
I'm going to leave you two lovebirds
in peace.

653
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:54,426
Hello, Shirley.

654
00:58:56,308 --> 00:58:57,536
Come on.

655
00:58:58,148 --> 00:58:59,900
Do you want a drink?

656
00:59:05,948 --> 00:59:07,461
Chase those years away.

657
00:59:07,548 --> 00:59:09,140
Listen, Shirley.

658
00:59:09,668 --> 00:59:13,104
Look, your mother and my mother
have the idea that...

659
00:59:14,228 --> 00:59:15,786
Look, I'm very flattered.

660
00:59:15,868 --> 00:59:19,338
And, well, I just don't want you
to be under any false impressions.

661
00:59:19,428 --> 00:59:20,941
It's all right.

662
00:59:21,228 --> 00:59:23,219
I don't like you, either.

663
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:26,617
Sam!

664
00:59:27,868 --> 00:59:30,177
Jack! Excuse me, Shirley.

665
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:32,981
I'm sorry.

666
00:59:35,828 --> 00:59:37,784
- Do you remember Alison?
- Good evening.

667
00:59:37,868 --> 00:59:40,223
Alison, Sam Lowry, an old friend.

668
00:59:40,308 --> 00:59:42,219
Alison, yes, of course.

669
00:59:43,028 --> 00:59:45,462
- You look different.
- I'm two years older.

670
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:48,585
And she's been to Dr. Jaffe.
She doesn't like me telling people.

671
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:50,579
But, in fact, she's really pleased.

672
00:59:50,668 --> 00:59:54,297
- I knew there was something different.
- Remember how they used to stick out?

673
00:59:54,388 --> 00:59:55,503
What?

674
00:59:55,708 --> 00:59:57,903
Yes, well, rather.

675
00:59:58,468 --> 01:00:02,143
- I always used to wonder if they were real.
- What, my ears?

676
01:00:04,828 --> 01:00:07,865
- Dr. Jaffe pinned her ears back.
- Yes, that's...

677
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:11,017
I always wondered if she wore falsies.

678
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,541
Mr. Helpmann.

679
01:00:13,588 --> 01:00:14,941
False ears.

680
01:00:16,388 --> 01:00:18,743
- Hello, Jack.
- You remember my wife, Alison?

681
01:00:18,828 --> 01:00:22,104
Of course, Barbara, isn't it? How are you?

682
01:00:22,188 --> 01:00:24,577
Barbara's very well. How are you?

683
01:00:24,828 --> 01:00:26,261
- Fine, thanks.
- Good.

684
01:00:26,348 --> 01:00:30,307
Hello, Sam. Ida said you might be here.
Have you got a minute?

685
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:32,380
Would you excuse us?

686
01:00:32,908 --> 01:00:35,627
Of course. Come on, Alison... Barbara.

687
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:38,697
Sam...

688
01:00:42,868 --> 01:00:44,506
I need your help.

689
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:08,301
Thanks very much.

690
01:01:08,388 --> 01:01:10,663
Mr. Helpmann, I'm glad to be of help.

691
01:01:10,748 --> 01:01:12,818
And if I can help you...

692
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:21,097
Your father and I were very close.

693
01:01:21,668 --> 01:01:25,581
Of course, Jeremiah was senior to me,
but we were close friends.

694
01:01:25,828 --> 01:01:28,023
Especially after the bombing.

695
01:01:29,348 --> 01:01:32,784
And now I keep his name alive
at the office every day.

696
01:01:33,948 --> 01:01:36,587
It's as though he's there
still speaking to me.

697
01:01:36,908 --> 01:01:38,341
"'Ere I am...

"J.H."

699
01:01:43,988 --> 01:01:45,979
The ghost in the machine.

700
01:01:48,468 --> 01:01:51,221
I know he would've wanted me to help you.

701
01:01:53,748 --> 01:01:55,784
And I promised your mother...

702
01:01:56,188 --> 01:01:59,783
that I'd take you onto the team
at Information Retrieval.

703
01:02:00,468 --> 01:02:03,028
- But I gather that you...
- Well...

704
01:02:03,748 --> 01:02:06,706
actually, Mr. Helpmann,
I've changed my mind.

705
01:02:07,468 --> 01:02:10,062
I've decided I'd accept the transfer.

706
01:02:10,908 --> 01:02:12,660
If I'm not too late.

707
01:02:13,668 --> 01:02:14,942
Too late?

708
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,945
That's for me to say.

709
01:02:18,308 --> 01:02:20,026
Well, then I am...

710
01:02:22,668 --> 01:02:25,057
Welcome to Information Retrieval.

711
01:02:57,188 --> 01:02:58,780
My name's Lowry.

712
01:03:00,148 --> 01:03:01,467
Sam Lowry.

713
01:03:02,428 --> 01:03:05,181
I've been told to report to Mr. Warrenn.

714
01:03:05,788 --> 01:03:07,540
Thirtieth floor, sir.

715
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:09,460
You're expected.

716
01:03:13,308 --> 01:03:15,947
- Don't you want to search me?
- No, sir.

717
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:20,617
- Want to see my ID?
- No need, sir.

718
01:03:22,908 --> 01:03:25,980
- But I could be anybody.
- No, you couldn't, sir.

719
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:28,298
This is Information Retrieval.

720
01:03:29,548 --> 01:03:31,504
The lift's arrived, sir.

721
01:05:15,268 --> 01:05:18,021
Half as terrorists, rest as victims.

722
01:05:18,988 --> 01:05:20,307
Definitely, no.

723
01:05:20,388 --> 01:05:22,777
My name's Lowry, Mr. Warrenn.
Sam Lowry.

724
01:05:22,868 --> 01:05:25,985
Yes. No. Cancel that. Okay.

725
01:05:27,228 --> 01:05:29,264
Glad to have you on board.

726
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:33,423
Don't be ridiculous, Jenkins.

727
01:05:33,868 --> 01:05:34,937
Yes.

728
01:05:35,228 --> 01:05:37,503
You'll like it up here.

729
01:05:37,628 --> 01:05:40,938
We've got a crack team of...
Are they kidding?...decision makers.

730
01:05:41,028 --> 01:05:45,101
In triplicate. I'm expecting big things...
Two copies to Finance!...of you.

731
01:05:48,868 --> 01:05:50,699
Between you and me, Lowry...

732
01:05:50,948 --> 01:05:54,145
this department is about to be upgraded.

733
01:05:56,868 --> 01:05:58,221
Here we are.

734
01:05:58,428 --> 01:06:00,988
Your very own number
on your very own door.

735
01:06:01,188 --> 01:06:03,907
And behind that door, your very own office.

736
01:06:03,988 --> 01:06:07,025
Congratulations, DZI015.

737
01:06:07,388 --> 01:06:08,946
Welcome to the team.

738
01:06:09,108 --> 01:06:11,338
Yes. No. Cancel that.

739
01:06:11,548 --> 01:06:13,618
Send two copies to Finance.
