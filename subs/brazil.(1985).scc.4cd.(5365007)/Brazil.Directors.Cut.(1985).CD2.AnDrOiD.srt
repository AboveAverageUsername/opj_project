3
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:32,083
You can't borrow any more chairs!
There's only one left in here now...

4
00:01:32,168 --> 00:01:34,557
- and I need that to sit on!
- What?

5
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:38,637
Sorry.

6
00:01:39,928 --> 00:01:41,327
Who are you?

7
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:44,078
My name's Lowry. Sam Lowry.

8
00:01:44,248 --> 00:01:46,921
Oh, yes, the new boy from next door.

9
00:01:48,528 --> 00:01:50,678
My name's Lime. Harvey Lime.

10
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:53,086
Welcome to Expediting.

11
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:56,484
Would you mind
if I borrowed your computer console?

12
00:01:56,568 --> 00:01:59,207
I'll let you have it back in 10 minutes.

13
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:02,246
You want to take my console
into your office?

14
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:04,758
Yes, just for a few minutes.

15
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,566
I'll tell you what...

16
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:09,845
you tell me what you want,
and I'll do it for you.

17
00:02:10,968 --> 00:02:13,163
I'm a bit of a whiz on that thing.

18
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,087
All right.

19
00:02:18,928 --> 00:02:22,364
- I need information on a woman named...
- A woman?

20
00:02:22,928 --> 00:02:24,327
- I see.
- Yes.

21
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:28,482
I know her age and distinguishing marks,
but I need an address, her place of work.

22
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:30,718
This your dream girl, is it?

23
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:35,683
Look, let me use your console.

24
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:37,806
You must be joking.

25
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:41,564
When there's a woman involved,
there's no stopping me.

26
00:02:42,488 --> 00:02:44,319
Let's have that sheet.

27
00:02:53,168 --> 00:02:54,920
Sod it, it's broken!

28
00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:57,437
But you haven't switched it on.

29
00:02:58,088 --> 00:02:59,282
Oh, yes.

30
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:05,406
You're putting me off standing there.
Go back to your office.

31
00:03:05,488 --> 00:03:08,286
I'll give you a knock when I've finished.

32
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,561
Go on, I'm not going to elope with her.

33
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:14,167
All right.

34
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:49,517
Sam!

35
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:12,957
Sam.

36
00:04:16,248 --> 00:04:17,522
Don't go.

37
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:20,922
Please.

38
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:34,443
Well?

39
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:38,520
- Computers are my forte.
- Let me see.

40
00:04:39,688 --> 00:04:43,840
"Gillian Layton. Coloring: White.
Hair: Blonde. Eyes: Blue. Height: 5'4".

41
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:46,317
"Distinguishing scar on left..."

42
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:48,721
Is this all you've got?

43
00:04:48,808 --> 00:04:52,437
Best to take things slowly
where some women are concerned.

44
00:04:52,688 --> 00:04:54,041
Let me see.

45
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:56,726
Hey, that's mine!

46
00:04:57,928 --> 00:04:59,202
"Layton.

47
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:02,644
"Truck driver. All inquiries...

48
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:06,357
"reference officer 412IL. Room 5001."

49
00:05:09,488 --> 00:05:10,841
Lowry, glad I caught you...

50
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:14,284
Send that back. Settling down?
I want this order rescinded.

51
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:17,917
There's a query about a personnel
transporter you took out from the pool.

52
00:05:18,008 --> 00:05:20,841
Or was it a personnel carrier you took?

53
00:05:20,928 --> 00:05:25,160
Send that up to Security.
Anyway, tidy it up, there's a good chap.

54
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:27,882
Get a new suit. You want the lift?

55
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,721
Can I help you?

56
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:52,758
I'm looking for Officer 412IL.

57
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:54,924
He won't be very long now.

58
00:06:58,328 --> 00:06:59,761
I thought so.

59
00:07:05,688 --> 00:07:07,360
You may go in now.

60
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:14,558
Not that one. That one.

61
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,603
Yes.

62
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:26,477
Excuse me, are you officer 412IL?

63
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,561
Excuse me!

64
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,363
Jack!

65
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:44,205
I heard you were coming aboard.
Congratulations.

66
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:46,483
- DZI015.
- Thanks.

67
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:48,999
Are you officer 412IL?

68
00:07:50,048 --> 00:07:51,766
That's me. For Sam.

69
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:54,721
- A very happy Christmas.
- Thanks, Jack.

70
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:57,766
- You're settling in all right?
- Yes, fine.

71
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:00,007
I need some information.

72
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:03,683
This is Information Retrieval,
not Information Dispersal.

73
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:06,607
Amy, don't throw the ball around in here.

74
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:10,437
I'm not Amy, I'm Holly.
Did I call you Amy, darling? I'm sorry.

75
00:08:10,528 --> 00:08:12,280
- A triplet?
- One of them, I think.

76
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:15,405
Barbara's taken
the other two Christmas shopping.

77
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:18,161
You're not gonna
keep calling her Barbara, are you?

78
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:22,207
Why not? Barbara's a perfectly good name,
isn't it? Don't you like it?

79
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:25,046
Yes, it's fine.

80
00:08:26,128 --> 00:08:28,562
Come on, let's get these together.

81
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:32,760
I need to find out about a woman.

82
00:08:32,848 --> 00:08:36,204
Come on, Chloe, let's show Uncle Sam
how we make the word "cat."

83
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:37,926
- Shall we?
- I'm Holly.

84
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:39,566
Sorry, love. So you are.

85
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:41,047
This is her.

86
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:44,964
Layton. Oh, shit.

87
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:50,203
- How much do you know about this?
- Not much.

88
00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:52,961
- What does B58l732 mean to you?
- Buttle.

89
00:08:54,648 --> 00:08:57,401
I knew it. You always were bloody quick.

90
00:08:58,608 --> 00:08:59,882
Who else knows?

91
00:08:59,968 --> 00:09:01,640
Warrenn? Helpmann?

92
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,801
I don't know.
I only know you got the wrong man.

93
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:07,038
Information Transit got the wrong man.

94
00:09:07,128 --> 00:09:10,518
I got the right man. The wrong man
was delivered to me as the right man.

95
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:13,600
I accepted him on good faith
as the right man.

96
00:09:13,768 --> 00:09:15,167
Was I wrong?

97
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:17,120
You killed Buttle?

98
00:09:18,608 --> 00:09:22,044
There are rigid parameters laid down
to prevent such things happening.

99
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,677
It wasn't my fault that Buttle's
heart condition wasn't on Tuttle's file.

100
00:09:25,768 --> 00:09:27,804
How are you getting on?

101
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,278
- I really need to know about...
- Tuttle?

102
00:09:32,368 --> 00:09:34,245
We'll bring Tuttle in...

103
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:37,764
and interrogate him
at the same voltage as Mr. Buttle.

104
00:09:37,888 --> 00:09:40,197
And juggle the books in electrical banking.

105
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:44,201
- What has Tuttle done?
- We suspect him of freelance subversion.

106
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:45,722
Freelance subversive?

107
00:09:45,808 --> 00:09:49,323
Then all I need to wrap up the case
is the Layton woman.

108
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:53,443
- What has she done?
- She witnessed the Tuttle... Buttle arrest.

109
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:56,520
Since then she's been going around
making wild allegations...

110
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:58,246
trying to exploit the situation.

111
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:01,684
She's working for someone,
and I don't think it's us.

112
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:03,127
Terrorist?

113
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,156
Mr. Lint, the next customer
has been delivered.

114
00:10:08,248 --> 00:10:10,887
- Thank you, Myrtle.
- What're you gonna do about Layton?

115
00:10:10,968 --> 00:10:15,484
I put her on the detention list.
Security should have her here before 6:00.

116
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,201
What, here?

117
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,445
So that she can spill the beans
inside the department?

118
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:21,961
Don't do that.

119
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,245
Why don't I try and get to her for you? I'll...

120
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:29,521
- I'll deactivate her.
- What does that mean?

121
00:10:29,608 --> 00:10:31,724
I want nothing unsavory.

122
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:33,321
Trust me, Jack.

123
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:36,558
Come on, put these away.
Mommy will be back.

124
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:38,445
Let me have her file.

125
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:41,761
Trust me, Jack.

126
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:44,367
All right.

127
00:10:47,088 --> 00:10:49,841
But for Christ's sake, don't lose it.

128
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:53,839
You sit down there, darling.

129
00:10:55,248 --> 00:10:59,958
- Don't worry, I'll get to her.
- You'll never get anywhere in a suit like that.

130
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:01,843
Here.

131
00:11:03,888 --> 00:11:05,162
Try this.

132
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:07,561
- Bye-bye.
- 'Bye.

133
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:11,041
But, Jack, I...

134
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:16,038
Put it on, big boy. I won't look at your willy.

135
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:28,161
Let him go.

136
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:02,677
Come on.

137
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:07,677
Shit!

138
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:23,117
Oi!

139
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:25,165
- Come out of there.
- What?

140
00:13:25,248 --> 00:13:27,682
That's the Deputy Minister's lift.

141
00:13:27,968 --> 00:13:29,799
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

142
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,006
Come here, sonny. Let's see your ID card.

143
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:34,237
My ID?

144
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:35,682
Oh, God!

145
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:38,760
This isn't my suit.

146
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:41,203
Look, my name's Lowry, Sam Lowry.

147
00:13:41,568 --> 00:13:44,241
- Look, really, can't this wait?
- No, sir.

148
00:13:44,768 --> 00:13:47,043
I'm going to have to fill in a report on this.

149
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:49,562
Now, then, what is the date today?

150
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:52,124
It's the... Oh, God, it'll have to wait!

151
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,721
You, stop!

152
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:25,637
Stop!

153
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:41,556
Well done, men. Quick thinking.

154
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:44,081
Excellent work.

155
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:48,124
I'll take charge of her now.

156
00:14:48,248 --> 00:14:49,442
Good.

157
00:14:51,488 --> 00:14:52,603
Okay.

158
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:57,805
It's a classified matter.

159
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:04,118
I'll include your fine handling
of the situation in my report.

160
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:06,277
Great.

161
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:10,644
Merry Christmas, Dawson.

162
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:13,198
Come along with me, please.

163
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:15,717
Okay, thanks. Well done, men.

164
00:15:16,368 --> 00:15:19,360
Excellent. Good turnout.
Very good, thank you.

165
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:40,761
Just keep moving.

166
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:42,167
Hey, stop!

167
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:45,601
Come back here.

168
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:47,884
Pick up all these things.

169
00:15:47,968 --> 00:15:49,799
Come on, pick them up.

170
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:52,487
Disgraceful.

171
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:55,166
Can't you even...

172
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:57,159
You illiterate foreign pig!

173
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,365
You come over here
from your own filthy country...

174
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:04,244
and mess up our streets.

175
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:06,237
God!

176
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:22,759
Well done! Let's go!

177
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:30,724
What are you doing?
For Christ's sake, keep moving!

178
00:16:32,328 --> 00:16:33,807
Get out of my cab.

179
00:16:33,888 --> 00:16:35,606
What? Just drive!

180
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:41,038
- You've touched me. Nobody touches me.
- What do you...

181
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:44,686
Please, drive on! Drive on, will you?

182
00:16:44,768 --> 00:16:46,326
Shit. Move over, I'll drive.

183
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:49,081
Don't touch that! Don't touch anything!

184
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:56,203
It's okay, Officer. Thank you.
I've got everything under control.

185
00:16:56,688 --> 00:16:58,121
Oh, shit!

186
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:03,000
Listen, please drive. Trust me.
You are in terrible danger.

187
00:17:03,248 --> 00:17:04,840
You're an embarrassment.

188
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:06,999
Please drive. Trust me.

189
00:17:07,328 --> 00:17:09,398
Drive and I'll explain everything.

190
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:12,366
Please, get out of my cab.

191
00:17:14,608 --> 00:17:15,927
I'm sorry, I...

192
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:20,286
Okay, you've asked for it.
I'm Information Retrieval Officer...

193
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:24,241
DZI105 and I'm arresting you so...

194
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:28,085
drive on, or I'll blast your fucking head off!

195
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:31,517
Go!

196
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:55,157
Look, I'm sorry about that.
I mean, touching you without permission.

197
00:17:56,288 --> 00:17:59,439
Hello, my name's Lowry. Sam Lowry.

198
00:17:59,888 --> 00:18:02,277
I've been...

199
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:10,202
You won't believe this.
I know it will sound incredible...

200
00:18:10,768 --> 00:18:13,202
but I've been dreaming about you.

201
00:18:13,808 --> 00:18:16,641
No, not like that. I mean, I love you.

202
00:18:17,168 --> 00:18:20,365
I mean, in my dreams, I love you and...

203
00:18:22,648 --> 00:18:24,604
Extraordinary, isn't it?

204
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,482
Anyway...

205
00:18:34,928 --> 00:18:37,123
You don't believe me, do you?

206
00:18:38,928 --> 00:18:43,444
You probably think I'm bonkers, right?
Mad, raving.

207
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:48,006
No! I think you're very attractive.

208
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:51,483
What?

209
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:54,966
Yeah. Sit back. Let me have a look at you.

210
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:04,122
Oh, yeah.

211
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:07,517
Good looking, sexy. Just my type.

212
00:19:10,688 --> 00:19:12,440
I don't believe you.

213
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:14,396
Why not?

214
00:19:14,968 --> 00:19:17,960
Well, I just don't deserve such terrific luck.

215
00:19:19,568 --> 00:19:21,206
You're damn right.

216
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,278
You don't trust me, do you?

217
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:43,762
My God, we shouldn't have come here!
I've got a job to do.

218
00:21:44,288 --> 00:21:46,006
But they'll be Iying in wait!

219
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:49,444
Christ, you're paranoid.
You got no sense of reality.

220
00:21:50,048 --> 00:21:51,163
Wait!

221
00:21:55,408 --> 00:21:58,844
We should take the lorry and get away!
Yeah, where to?

222
00:21:58,928 --> 00:22:02,204
Anywhere. As fast as possible.
There isn't anywhere.

223
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:05,166
Just far away.
It's not far enough.

224
00:22:21,768 --> 00:22:22,883
Jill!

225
00:23:14,008 --> 00:23:15,760
What's in the parcel?

226
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,966
A Christmas present.

227
00:23:26,768 --> 00:23:28,121
It's heavy.

228
00:23:29,088 --> 00:23:30,999
Heavy Christmas present.

229
00:23:31,088 --> 00:23:33,283
If you don't trust me, open it.

230
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:35,598
No, it's fine.

231
00:23:37,008 --> 00:23:38,919
I'd spoil the wrapping.

232
00:23:39,328 --> 00:23:43,844
Anyway, if I want you to trust me,
it's only fair that I should trust you.

233
00:23:50,688 --> 00:23:55,204
Doesn't it bother you, the sort of things
you do at Information Retrieval?

234
00:23:57,128 --> 00:23:59,722
Suppose you'd rather have terrorists.

235
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:07,284
How many actual terrorists
have you met, Sam?

236
00:24:10,288 --> 00:24:12,279
- Actual terrorists?
- Yeah.

237
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:18,959
It's only my first day.

238
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:32,727
A roadblock.

239
00:24:34,128 --> 00:24:36,403
- What're we gonna do?
- Stay calm.

240
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:39,127
Don't slow down! Don't stop!

241
00:24:39,488 --> 00:24:42,605
Please, do as I say. Go straight ahead. Go!

242
00:24:44,448 --> 00:24:47,121
What the fuck are you doing, you stupid...

243
00:24:58,848 --> 00:25:02,158
We did it! We broke right through them!

244
00:25:09,648 --> 00:25:12,401
Faster! Don't let them see you. Just go!

245
00:25:15,168 --> 00:25:16,886
Keep going! Faster!

246
00:25:18,488 --> 00:25:21,446
- Please, get your foot down!
- Stay off of me!

247
00:25:53,728 --> 00:25:55,047
Go faster!

248
00:26:00,928 --> 00:26:04,125
What if we lose the house?
Don't touch anything!

249
00:26:05,048 --> 00:26:06,686
Don't touch that!

250
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:31,837
We did it! We did it!

251
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,037
Oh, no!

252
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:56,758
What would you like for Christmas?

253
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,566
My own credit card.

254
00:27:09,448 --> 00:27:11,757
Why have we come here?
Go away.

255
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:15,206
- Why don't we go back to my flat?
- Forget it.

256
00:27:15,288 --> 00:27:16,437
You don't trust me?

257
00:27:16,528 --> 00:27:19,725
Trust you? A man who hijacks my truck,
loses me my job...

258
00:27:19,808 --> 00:27:22,800
has every security man in town
looking for me? Of course I do.

259
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:25,038
I was only trying to help.
Yeah!

260
00:27:25,248 --> 00:27:28,320
I don't trust you either.
What's in that parcel?

261
00:27:28,568 --> 00:27:31,446
You saved it from the lorry.
It must be very special.

262
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:34,645
I saved you from the lorry.
You're not very special.

263
00:27:34,728 --> 00:27:37,196
- I'm gonna open it.
- Don't touch it.

264
00:27:46,568 --> 00:27:47,637
Sam!

265
00:27:47,808 --> 00:27:49,241
It's me...

266
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:51,047
and Shirley.

267
00:27:53,528 --> 00:27:54,961
Mrs. Terrain!

268
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,004
That should hold it.
Sam?

269
00:28:01,528 --> 00:28:03,007
Hello, Shirley.

270
00:28:06,688 --> 00:28:08,167
What's happened to you now?

271
00:28:08,248 --> 00:28:11,081
My complication had a little complication.

272
00:28:12,008 --> 00:28:14,886
But Dr. Chapman says I'll soon be up...

273
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:17,961
and bounding about like a young gazelle.

274
00:28:18,688 --> 00:28:21,725
You buying a Christmas present
for your mother?

275
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:26,164
Yes, a little something.

276
00:28:26,368 --> 00:28:29,565
Shirley and I come here regular-larly.

277
00:28:30,568 --> 00:28:32,957
We love romantic lingerie.

278
00:28:36,328 --> 00:28:38,080
Picture me in these.

279
00:28:43,928 --> 00:28:45,202
Oh, my God!

280
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:47,563
Sam, where are you going?

281
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:00,283
Jill?

282
00:29:22,608 --> 00:29:24,280
Are you all right?

283
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,124
You don't deserve to be!

284
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:31,718
What a bloody stupid thing!

285
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,085
How could you? Look at these people!

286
00:29:34,168 --> 00:29:35,362
My God!

287
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,198
It was a bomb!

288
00:29:38,448 --> 00:29:41,724
I should've opened it.
I sat there with it next...

289
00:29:43,168 --> 00:29:45,238
There's your bomb, asshole!

290
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,360
A bribe for official monkeys like you.

291
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,925
Make yourself useful.

292
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:05,603
Here!

293
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,838
Don't touch her! She's hurt.

294
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,640
Don't touch her!

295
00:30:21,248 --> 00:30:22,363
Stop!

296
00:30:30,448 --> 00:30:31,676
Sam, no!

297
00:30:45,168 --> 00:30:47,807
These helmets make your scalp itch.

298
00:30:47,928 --> 00:30:50,726
Don't mention it. And they make you sweat.

299
00:30:51,168 --> 00:30:53,841
Half the time I can never see
where I'm going.

300
00:30:53,928 --> 00:30:57,079
It's a great Niagara of perspiration
coming down.

301
00:30:57,728 --> 00:31:01,084
I'm lucky. I've got these thick eyebrows.

302
00:31:01,448 --> 00:31:04,520
That keeps it up
and channels it out to the ears.

303
00:31:04,608 --> 00:31:05,597
Jill!

304
00:31:05,688 --> 00:31:06,677
Who's he?

305
00:31:06,768 --> 00:31:09,919
I don't know,
somebody from Information Retrieval.

306
00:31:10,008 --> 00:31:12,124
They're always hanging around in lingerie.

307
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:13,641
Where is she?

308
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:18,080
Jill, is that you?

309
00:31:18,888 --> 00:31:21,766
Excuse me, sir.
That is government property.

310
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:28,918
Jill! Answer me!

311
00:31:30,608 --> 00:31:33,247
I'm looking for a girl with blonde hair.

312
00:31:33,328 --> 00:31:35,637
She's medium height, green eyes.

313
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:38,845
I don't know, sir.
They check all that at the depot.

314
00:31:38,928 --> 00:31:42,921
We can't allow that.
It's more than our job's worth.

315
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:45,325
Jill, you must be here.

316
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,559
You can fill in an application form
if you're a relative.

317
00:31:48,648 --> 00:31:50,639
Now do stop, sir, please.

318
00:31:58,088 --> 00:31:59,919
Sorry about that, sir.

319
00:32:00,368 --> 00:32:01,767
Regulations.

320
00:32:08,008 --> 00:32:10,238
This is a black eye
for the department, Lowry.

321
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,364
I don't care how you behaved at Records.

322
00:32:12,448 --> 00:32:14,837
Informational Retrieval
is an executive branch.

323
00:32:14,928 --> 00:32:17,726
We're proud of our reputation
and we protect it.

324
00:32:17,808 --> 00:32:21,562
That convoy of personnel carriers
is still not accounted for!

325
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,606
I thought I told you to deal with it.
And what is this mess?

326
00:32:24,688 --> 00:32:27,646
An empty desk is an efficient desk!
Good God!

327
00:32:27,928 --> 00:32:31,364
Queries from Security. Searches
from Central Banking about a check.

328
00:32:31,448 --> 00:32:34,599
Clarification notices from Accounting
about unreturned receipts!

329
00:32:34,688 --> 00:32:37,521
- Mr. Warrenn, I have to find out...
- Shut up!

330
00:32:37,968 --> 00:32:40,766
I don't know what's going on here, Lowry.

331
00:32:41,488 --> 00:32:45,959
But don't think you can intimidate us
with your friends in high places!

332
00:32:46,288 --> 00:32:47,721
Now shape up!

333
00:32:51,808 --> 00:32:54,641
Lime, I have to use your computer.

334
00:32:54,728 --> 00:32:57,083
Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.

335
00:32:57,488 --> 00:33:00,958
You seem to have rather a lot
to get on with yourself.

336
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:08,803
Shit!

337
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:10,886
Come off it, Jack.

338
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:13,607
Of course you can check
to see if she's been arrested.

339
00:33:13,688 --> 00:33:18,398
Sorry, Sam, this case has become
more complicated since last we talked.

340
00:33:18,968 --> 00:33:22,199
But she's innocent, Jack.
She's done nothing wrong.

341
00:33:22,288 --> 00:33:25,405
Tell that to the wives of the men
she blew up this afternoon.

342
00:33:25,488 --> 00:33:27,444
She's not alone in all this.

343
00:33:27,528 --> 00:33:29,439
We just had a report in that Tuttle...

344
00:33:29,528 --> 00:33:33,077
has wrecked an entire flat
and sabotaged adjacent Central Services.

345
00:33:33,168 --> 00:33:35,523
As a matter of fact,
it looks like in your block.

346
00:33:35,608 --> 00:33:38,600
I'd keep my eyes open if I were you. 'Bye.

347
00:33:39,928 --> 00:33:43,523
But, Jack, you don't think Tuttle
and the girl are in league, do you?

348
00:33:43,608 --> 00:33:46,600
I do. Everything's connected.
All along the line.

349
00:33:46,688 --> 00:33:48,918
Cause and effect, that's the beauty of it.

350
00:33:49,008 --> 00:33:52,603
Our job is to trace the connections
and then reveal them.

351
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:58,726
This whole Buttle-Tuttle confusion
was obviously planned from the inside.

352
00:33:58,808 --> 00:34:00,400
But, Jack...

353
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:03,040
She's innocent, Jack.

354
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:08,239
- We've always been close, haven't we?
- Yes, Jack.

355
00:34:08,368 --> 00:34:11,565
Until this all blows over,
just stay away from me.

356
00:36:19,288 --> 00:36:20,403
It's you!

357
00:36:20,568 --> 00:36:23,401
What's happening?

358
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,887
Your thermostat's gone, and then some.

359
00:36:28,008 --> 00:36:29,805
What happened to my flat?

360
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:31,526
Hello? What?

361
00:36:32,248 --> 00:36:33,681
It's for you, but...

362
00:36:34,168 --> 00:36:35,840
as you don't live here anymore.

363
00:36:35,928 --> 00:36:37,281
- What?
- Absolutely.

364
00:36:37,368 --> 00:36:38,881
Do you know what this is?

365
00:36:38,968 --> 00:36:41,846
This is an H2206...

366
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:46,360
authorizing the compulsory,
temporary requisitioning of this flat...

367
00:36:46,488 --> 00:36:48,444
for our necessary repairs.

368
00:36:52,088 --> 00:36:54,124
Don't forget your receipt!

369
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:59,564
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler
for paperwork.

370
00:37:03,048 --> 00:37:04,322
Bastards!

371
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,646
What are you doing?

372
00:38:04,528 --> 00:38:06,564
It's getting cold in here.

373
00:38:08,688 --> 00:38:09,837
Oh, God!

374
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:12,160
It smells badly.

375
00:38:13,008 --> 00:38:15,647
It's shit! We're filling up with shit!

376
00:38:31,248 --> 00:38:32,476
Oh, shit.

377
00:38:34,768 --> 00:38:36,998
We're all in it together, kid.

378
00:38:48,648 --> 00:38:50,843
Jill!

379
00:38:53,928 --> 00:38:54,917
Oh, God.

380
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,160
Are you all right?

381
00:38:57,888 --> 00:39:01,403
- What happened to you after...
- Your face. Are you hurt?

382
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,641
No, I'm fine.

383
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:10,837
I've been worried sick about you.

384
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:26,161
- Who was that?
- That's a friend of mine.

385
00:39:27,848 --> 00:39:29,486
Oh, God! Holy shit!

386
00:39:29,808 --> 00:39:32,686
We better get out of here, quick. Come on.

387
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:39,045
Thank God! Here, take it.

388
00:39:41,288 --> 00:39:42,846
It's not so big.

389
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,520
Are you sure this is all right?

390
00:40:34,608 --> 00:40:36,041
Yes, certain.

391
00:40:37,408 --> 00:40:39,683
My mother's away for Christmas.

392
00:40:40,728 --> 00:40:43,561
She's spending it at the plastic surgeon's.

393
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:48,644
The wraps come off tomorrow.

394
00:41:27,488 --> 00:41:31,083
Lock the door after me.
Don't answer the phone to anyone.

395
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,240
I won't be long.

396
00:41:34,848 --> 00:41:37,408
Where're you going?
I know a way to save you.

397
00:41:37,488 --> 00:41:39,240
Trust me. I can do it.

398
00:41:39,488 --> 00:41:40,716
You can't go without me!

399
00:42:14,928 --> 00:42:18,364
Excuse me, Dawson, could you
put me through to Mr. Helpmann's office?

400
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:22,407
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have
to go through the proper channels.

401
00:42:22,488 --> 00:42:25,048
And you can't tell me what
the proper channels are...

402
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:27,767
because that's classified information.

403
00:42:28,368 --> 00:42:32,839
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing
its tradition of recruiting the brightest.

404
00:42:33,568 --> 00:42:35,206
Thank you, Dawson.

405
00:42:42,048 --> 00:42:44,801
Goodnight, Mr. Lime.
Goodnight, Dawson.

406
00:43:14,448 --> 00:43:18,043
No, no, Arthur. You're flat on the G!

407
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:21,598
It's your breathing.
Take a deep breath after "Noel."

408
00:43:21,688 --> 00:43:23,565
Ready, one, two, three.

409
00:43:34,728 --> 00:43:37,800
"'Ere I am, J.H."

410
00:43:39,128 --> 00:43:40,880
The ghost in the machine.

411
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:08,463
Mr. Helpmann?

412
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,143
Mr. Helpmann?

413
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:07,225
Jill.

414
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,349
Who's there?

415
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:08,222
What do you think?

416
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,504
Is it me?

417
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:18,025
What?

418
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:25,306
You don't exist anymore.

419
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,822
I've killed you.

420
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,102
Jill Layton is dead.

421
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:44,820
Care for a little necrophilia?

422
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:47,582
Merry Christmas.

423
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:02,620
Something for an executive?

424
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:21,583
She's dead.

425
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,981
This is a friend of mine.

426
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,619
No!

427
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:30,099
Sam!

428
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,787
93IHKSI608, you are charged
with the following:

429
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,578
"Giving aid and comfort
to the enemies of society.

430
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:44,865
"Attempting to conceal a fugitive
from justice.

431
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:48,386
"Passing confidential documents
to unauthorized personnel.

432
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:51,507
"Destroying government property,
viz. Several personnel carriers.

433
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:54,309
"Taking possession under false pretences
of said carriers.

434
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:57,029
"Forging the signature
of the Head of Records.

435
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:00,420
"Misdirecting funds in the form
of a check to A. Buttle...

436
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:02,228
"through unauthorized channels.

437
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:04,505
"Tampering with Central Services'
supply ducts.

438
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:07,024
"Obstructing forces of law and order.

439
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,340
"Disgracing the good name
of the government...

440
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:11,625
"and the Department
of Information Retrieval.

441
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:15,339
"Disrupting the Ministry's
internal communicating system.

442
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:18,539
"Wasting Ministry time and paper."

443
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:22,826
Now, either you can plead guilty
to seven or eight of the charges...

444
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:26,107
which will help keep costs down
within your means...

445
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:30,263
or borrow a sum to be negotiated
from us at a very competitive rate.

446
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:33,786
We can offer you something
at eleven-and-a-half percent over 30 years...

447
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:36,942
but you will have to buy insurance
to qualify for this scheme.

448
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,066
If you prefer something more specific...

449
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:41,823
say, against electrical charges over £70...

450
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:44,663
All you're requested to do now
is sign this form.

451
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,547
Think carefully before you sign.

452
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:49,827
Thinking ahead in financial matters
is always a wise course.

453
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:51,309
Plead guilty.

454
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:52,823
It's cheaper.

455
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:00,342
Sam, what are we going to do with you?

456
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:04,423
Where's Jill?

457
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,187
I've got to find her.

458
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:11,428
Please, you've got to get me out of here.

459
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:15,259
I understand, Sam.
I know exactly how you feel...

460
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:18,423
so I brought you a bottle of barley water.

461
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:20,588
Please help me.

462
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:24,422
I assure you,
I'm doing everything within my power.

463
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:27,263
But the rules of the game are laid down.

464
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:30,542
We all have to play by them. Even me.

465
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:35,261
It's all a mistake.
You've got to understand that.

466
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:40,742
From the Department's point of view,
there was certainly a bit of an own goal.

467
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,582
I'm not a terrorist.

468
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,103
You know that. Please get me out of here!

469
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:49,103
Sam, Information Retrieval is expensive.

470
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:52,986
You're running up an enormous bill
by not cooperating.

471
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,867
Please, Mr. Helpmann...

472
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:59,262
help me find Jill.

473
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,219
Sam, I think I ought to tell you.

474
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:11,659
I'm afraid she's upped stumps
and retired to the pavilion.

475
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:16,142
Thrown in the towel.

476
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,625
Dead?

477
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:20,819
Yes.

478
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:25,868
It's all a bit confusing, but it seems
she was killed resisting arrest.

479
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:33,065
No, it's all right. I did that.

480
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:39,267
The odd thing is
it appears to have happened twice.

481
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:41,944
A bit of a disputed call, I'm afraid.

482
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:45,139
Twice?

483
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:50,263
There you are. All I can say is
don't fall at the last fence.

484
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,787
The finish is in sight.
See you in the paddock.

485
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:56,578
Do cooperate. Think of your mother.

486
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:59,065
Good luck. Keep your eye on the ball.

487
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:01,948
Got to go. Can't keep the orphans waiting.

488
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:12,299
No!

489
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:33,140
Don't fight it, son. Confess. Quickly.

490
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:38,663
If you hold out too long,
you could jeopardize your credit rating.

491
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,499
Jack?

492
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:38,498
Shut up!

493
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:43,298
Jack, I'm innocent. Please help me.

494
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:44,898
Bastard!

495
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:50,103
Jack, this is all a mistake. Please, Jack.

496
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:51,908
Take that mask off.

497
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,748
You stupid bastard!

498
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,461
How could you do this to me?

499
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,143
Jack, I'm frightened.

500
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,505
How do you think I feel? You shit!

501
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:08,182
Jack...
Shut up!

502
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:16,340
This is a professional relationship.

503
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,229
You can't!

504
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:25,782
No, Jack, please!

505
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:14,704
You okay?

506
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,024
Tuttle!

507
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:18,029
Call me Harry.

508
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:05,264
Let's go!

509
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:06,226
Mr. Lowry, so pleased you could make it.

510
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:08,223
Right this way.

511
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,222
It's a sad loss.

512
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:18,504
Your mother was with her at the end.

513
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:26,263
Mrs. Terrain has just received
that most wonderful of gifts.

514
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:29,300
She came to us physically new.

515
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:33,182
She goes hence from us
not so physically new.

516
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:35,545
But the spirit never grows old.

517
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:38,662
Madam Lowry!

518
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:44,064
Mother!

519
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:46,779
Sam!

520
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:49,943
Mother?

521
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,502
Stop calling me that.

522
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:58,104
Mother, please!

523
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:00,906
Is this guy bothering you?

524
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,059
Mother!

525
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:07,826
Go away. This is a very sacred moment.

526
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:12,227
He's got away from us, Jack.

527
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:15,461
I'm afraid you're right, Mr. Helpmann.
He's gone.

528
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:58,620
Tomorrow was another day

529
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:03,784
The morning found me miles away

530
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:09,148
With still a million things to say

531
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:14,660
Now

532
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:19,468
As twilight beams the sky above

533
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:23,746
Recalling thrills of our love

534
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:29,544
There's one thing I'm certain of

535
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:34,821
Return I will

536
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:42,347
To old Brazil

537
