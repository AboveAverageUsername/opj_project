00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:16,704

3
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,950
Where once a Belgian
Orchard Bloomed.

4
00:01:17,274 --> 00:01:22,809
Here's another Yankee letter for
private Paul Bergot! Where is he?

5
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,996
Two days ago I saw
him in No-Man's Land!

6
00:03:27,386 --> 00:03:31,329
Next time. Cootie, you'll
keep your head down!

7
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,830
Private Paul Bergot
c/s Belgian Reh Croad,
Octend, Belgium.

8
00:05:47,642 --> 00:06:01,925
I hope you are better.
Your letters have been
a great joy to me,
and my heart in warmer for know.
ing I have as a dear dear friend,
a brave soldier of another nation.
Your English has im

9
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:25,547
your safety.
Because an ocean rolls between us,
and me are never to meet,
I find the courage to put
my whole heart on paper and to tell you,
I love you, I love you, I love you.
Mary Brown

10
00:07:02,614 --> 00:07:13,105
Then the Armistice. Peace and
fleets of liners laden with
immigrants seeking a newer
Rainbow in the Land of Promise.

11
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:32,660
Ellis Island,
the Funnel of America.

12
00:07:47,185 --> 00:07:48,407
The Great Zandow

13
00:07:48,408 --> 00:07:51,479
strongest man in the world

14
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:01,461
The Great Zandow and co.

15
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:05,127
Well, where's the Company?

16
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:25,871
My company - I captured
him in the war!

17
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:54,890
The Crown Prince gave
me this hat!

18
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,378
Take that! - and that!-
and that! - and--

19
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,837
Harry Veber
vaudeville
booking agent

20
00:11:41,354 --> 00:11:50,875
I lift the heaviest weights
in the world, and when
I shoot myself from a cannon
to a trapeze it's a sensation!

21
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:09,270
I tell you I'm NOT Mary Brown, and I
never wrote to any soldiers--

22
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:19,411
And if you don't stop following me I'll turn
you over to a truant officer!

23
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:15,729
Pardon, Major, do you know
a girl named Mary Brown?

24
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:37,605
Sure - she passes that
corner every day!

25
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,248
Sink that roll, Lilly, there's
a 'dick' trailing me!

26
00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:50,138
Out of jail a week,
and at it again, huh?

27
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:15,688
You were looking for Mary Brown,
were you not?

28
00:16:20,036 --> 00:16:22,309
Well, I'm Little Mary.

29
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,881
What's a nickel!
I got plenty of money.

30
00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:04,724
The Russell Apartments!

31
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:35,794
Hey, there! You can't leave
your women lying around like this!

32
00:22:16,182 --> 00:22:17,182
Room three, upstairs.

33
00:27:14,256 --> 00:27:18,613
You let me out of here
or I'll holler!

34
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,912
Don't let this leak out!

35
00:29:08,687 --> 00:29:12,602
Where will I find the studio
of Madame Browne?

36
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:45,821
In two days we open my big act in Cloverdale
and the loafer is late for the train!!

37
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:07,776
Cloverdale had once been
a peaceful little border town.

38
00:31:34,236 --> 00:31:45,474
But over-night Cloverdale had changed....
Certain interests found it ideally
located for a defiance of law.

39
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:13,319
The Town Hall we re-named "The Palace"...
and the profits ran into thousands.

40
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:48,556
"The Palace" and its attractions were
taking their toll from village homes.

41
00:32:57,099 --> 00:32:59,498
Come on. Sis, come on home.

42
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:05,444
If my Dad was here.
He'd fix you!

43
00:33:10,944 --> 00:33:15,436
Justice and decency had fled
before the new law. Money.

44
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,417
The only force left opposing "Mike" McDevitt,
owner of "The Palace", was Parson Brown.

45
00:33:33,796 --> 00:33:38,459
It's useless to fight me any longer.
Money talks louder than you!

46
00:33:45,781 --> 00:33:49,914
Every man has his price!
Now what's YOURS?

47
00:34:00,522 --> 00:34:08,159
The House of God is founded on a ROCK.
For the miseries you caused,
The Master will destroy you!

48
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:27,904
Listen, fool! Continue
these demonstrations
against me and I'll give
you something real to pray for!

49
00:34:37,388 --> 00:34:44,205
The curch people of the town,
horrified by conditions,
rallied at the call of their pastor.

50
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:06,629
Bretheren, stand firm! The Good Book
says ' Faith can move mountains!'

51
00:35:15,787 --> 00:35:25,569
For the Lord said into Joshua:
March around the walls of Jericho seven days,
and on the Seventh day the walls shall fall

52
00:35:32,357 --> 00:35:41,843
This is the Sixth day of marching
around OUR Jericho. Believe ye and Behold!
The Miracle shall be repeated!

53
00:36:01,871 --> 00:36:05,050
Hymn 339
Onward Christian Soldiers.

54
00:36:22,785 --> 00:36:26,343
Here comes 'Holy Joe'
playing Joshua again!

55
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:39,342
Onward Christian soldiers.
Marching as to war.

56
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:50,634
I believe in this - and wish
I'd led a cleaner life.

57
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:56,161
Aw, shut up!
Pretty soon you'll
be washing your neck!

58
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:11,870
'Holy Joe's out there again trying
to sing the shingles off the roof!

59
00:37:14,807 --> 00:37:24,064
If that Psalm-singing idiot
bother me much more,
I'll have his daughter in here
as the main attraction!

60
00:37:27,963 --> 00:37:34,474
A few hours later. Another
meeting behind the church.

61
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:47,112
Mary Brown, the Parson's daughter,
saw the world through the eyes of optimism.
Perhaps because she was blind.

62
00:38:18,135 --> 00:38:24,501
Miss Mary: tell us that story again about the
Belgian soldier who won the war.

63
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:40,704
Once there was a plain little girl who dared to
love a brave, handsome soldier

64
00:38:56,002 --> 00:39:06,365
But when he wrote that 
he was coming to America, 
she stopped writing and hid.
For she had never told him, 
she was ...  blind.

65
00:39:11,871 --> 00:39:14,605
COMING the great Zandow
strongest man in the world

66
00:39:23,264 --> 00:39:29,327
Yes, this has been a dirty trip!
Last night I gave my boy a bath and...

67
00:39:56,934 --> 00:40:01,005
Say, what did you swallow?
A fish horn?

68
00:40:23,751 --> 00:40:27,082
If you feel like you sound
you need a plumber.

69
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,565
What's the time, please?

70
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:51,340
One more germ out of you and the Smith
Brothers lose a good customer!

71
00:46:52,044 --> 00:46:55,068
My head's clear!
I'm beginning to smell!

72
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:55,106
Glad you're here. Big Boy; the whole town's
crazy too see your Cannon Act!

73
00:47:59,255 --> 00:48:00,844
Stage Entrance

74
00:49:05,641 --> 00:49:08,773
Where do you get the water?

75
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,275
Behind the church.

76
00:49:17,784 --> 00:49:19,570
Ask Mary Brown.

77
00:49:29,877 --> 00:49:30,877
WHO?

78
00:49:33,316 --> 00:49:34,316
MARY BROWN.

79
00:51:00,321 --> 00:51:03,911
Are you Mary Brown?
Miss Mary Brown?

80
00:51:15,682 --> 00:51:20,790
The little Mary Brown who wrote such
nice letters to a boy in Belgium?

81
00:51:40,296 --> 00:51:43,819
And now he's
right here in town...

82
00:51:57,529 --> 00:51:58,529
I'm him.

83
00:52:03,533 --> 00:52:06,374
Aren't you surprised
to see me?

84
00:53:50,015 --> 00:53:55,934
And in that town there was only one 
Mary Brown... and she was a Chinaman!

85
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:28,289
And another one said
I'm little Mary.

86
00:57:12,206 --> 00:57:17,885
They're howling for you ...
Do you stuff or there'll be a riot!

87
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:21,088
If you want to get out of town alive you'd
better please that gang out there!

88
00:58:28,154 --> 00:58:31,669
Where's the Strong Man?
Show us the big Bum!

89
00:59:02,228 --> 00:59:06,879
Do something ... the longer they wait
the tougher they get!

90
00:59:17,275 --> 00:59:22,062
I paid for a Strong Man...
And I'm going to have one!

91
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:45,289
DIVON

92
01:04:25,512 --> 01:04:28,761
Mister Zandow...
I can't do the Cannon trick!

93
01:04:34,779 --> 01:04:37,014
Bring on the Cannon trick!

94
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,545
Come on! Get shot
out of that cannon!

95
01:05:50,266 --> 01:05:53,983
We must be quiet...
There's a funeral!

96
01:06:05,426 --> 01:06:11,397
The Kid's right! Let's bow our heads
and pray for poor old 'Holy Joe'!

97
01:06:24,696 --> 01:06:29,141
And if 'Holy Joe' must
sing, get him a ukulele!

98
01:06:46,386 --> 01:06:51,256
And may we soon have the honor of 
enterraining Mary Brown in our midst!

99
01:06:57,581 --> 01:06:58,581
A... Men!

100
01:08:02,584 --> 01:08:06,372
It's a riot! Lock the doors
and protect the money!

101
01:11:17,553 --> 01:11:18,553
Dump Trach Here

102
01:13:04,106 --> 01:13:07,276
Drive the money
changers from us!

103
01:13:42,369 --> 01:13:50,356
Once again Cloverdale tucked the bed 
covers beneath its chin and slept in peace....

104
01:13:59,786 --> 01:14:04,043
.... protected by the majesty
of the law.

105
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:47,640
Run along home, honey.
I don't need any help!

106
01:14:48,305 --> 01:15:48,546
