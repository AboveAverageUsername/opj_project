3
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:57,655
You wouldn't have a match
by any chance, would you ?

4
00:03:01,951 --> 00:03:03,870
Oh, oh, oh!

5
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:21,262
The air got to it.

6
00:03:21,554 --> 00:03:23,264
The air got to it!

7
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:09,352
Come on, come on.
Come on.

8
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:16,609
I did it.
I did it.

9
00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:22,782
Fire!

10
00:04:22,907 --> 00:04:24,951
There you go!

11
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:27,078
Light it up!
Come on!

12
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:29,706
# The time to hesitate
is through #

13
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:32,083
Ouch!

14
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:34,335
Ouch!

15
00:04:34,627 --> 00:04:38,256
# No time to wallow
in the mire #

16
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:41,676
# Try now, we can only lose #

17
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,637
# 'Cause girl
we couldn't get much higher #

18
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:48,683
# Come on, baby
light my fire ##

19
00:04:48,808 --> 00:04:51,769
Here you go!
Here you go!

20
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:54,022
It's a signal fire!

21
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:58,610
And it spells out
S.O.S!

22
00:04:58,693 --> 00:05:00,403
Whoa!

23
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,990
It's a meteor shower!

24
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:06,034
Fireflies!
Go! Run!

25
00:05:06,075 --> 00:05:08,953
You're free! You're free!
Ouch! Ouch!

26
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:10,997
Yeah!

27
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,291
Yes!

28
00:05:13,374 --> 00:05:15,877
Look what I have created!

29
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:18,087
I have made fire!

30
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:21,633
I... have made fire!

31
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:35,355
Mmm!

32
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:44,280
You gotta love crab.

33
00:05:46,658 --> 00:05:48,409
In the nick of time too.

34
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:53,414
I couldn't take much more
of those coconuts.

35
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:55,708
Coconut milk's
a natural laxative.

36
00:05:57,794 --> 00:06:00,713
Things that Gilligan
never told us.

37
00:06:00,755 --> 00:06:02,715
Oh.

38
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:16,896
Pretty well-made fire,
huh, Wilson?

39
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:28,199
So... Wilson.

40
00:06:28,283 --> 00:06:30,451
We were en route...

41
00:06:30,743 --> 00:06:34,747
from Memphis
for 11 and a half hours.

42
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:38,835
About 475 miles an hour.

43
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:42,881
So they think that
we are right here.

44
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:44,883
But...

45
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:48,011
we went out
of radio contact

46
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:52,390
and flew around that storm
for about an hour.

47
00:06:52,473 --> 00:06:55,310
So that's a distance
of what, 400 miles?

48
00:06:57,145 --> 00:06:59,063
Four hundred miles squared.

49
00:06:59,147 --> 00:07:03,067
That's 160,000

50
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:06,863
times pi; 3.14...

51
00:07:09,782 --> 00:07:14,204
Five hundred and two thousand,
four...

52
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:18,166
That's a search area
of 500,000 square miles.

53
00:07:20,835 --> 00:07:22,921
That's twice the size
of Texas.

54
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,300
They may never find us.

55
00:07:52,408 --> 00:07:55,161
This tooth is just killing me.

56
00:07:55,286 --> 00:07:57,789
It started out just hurting
when l bit down,

57
00:07:57,914 --> 00:08:01,417
but now it just hurts
all the time.

58
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:04,212
All the time.

59
00:08:04,337 --> 00:08:07,048
It's - lt's a good thing there's
not much to eat around here,

60
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:09,175
because I don't think
I could chew it.

61
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:14,514
Just keep sucking on all
that coconut and all that crab.

62
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:19,018
And just think,

63
00:08:19,143 --> 00:08:21,521
I used to avoid
going to the dentist

64
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:24,858
like the plague.

65
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:28,444
I put it off every
single chance l got. But now,

66
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:32,448
oh, what I wouldn't give

67
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:35,618
to have a dentist
right here in this cave.

68
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,293
In fact,
I wish you were a dentist.

69
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:51,050
Yeah.

70
00:08:51,134 --> 00:08:53,052
Dr. Wilson.

71
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:05,315
You wanna hear
something funny?

72
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:10,028
Back home in Memphis,

73
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:14,032
my dentist's name is
Dr. James Spaulding.

74
00:09:34,302 --> 00:09:36,638
She's much prettier
in real life.

75
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:56,814
Shut up!

76
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,798
" Bakersfield"?

77
00:15:08,261 --> 00:15:10,763
Bakersfield!

78
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:09,697
This could work.

79
00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:13,034
This could work.

80
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:50,738
Twenty-two...
Forty-four lashings.

81
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:54,701
Forty-four lashings.
So...

82
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,038
We have to make rope again.

83
00:17:03,126 --> 00:17:05,461
Wilson, we're gonna have to make
a hell of a lot of rope.

84
00:17:11,843 --> 00:17:14,554
Eight lashings
of these structurals.

85
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:17,599
That's 24 a piece.

86
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,977
That'll be 100... 160.

87
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,354
Here we are today.

88
00:17:23,438 --> 00:17:27,942
That gives us another month and a half
until we're into March and April,

89
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:31,446
which is our best chance for
the high tides and the offshore breezes.

90
00:17:32,989 --> 00:17:38,411
We need...
We need 424 feet...

91
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:41,956
of good rope, plus another 50 feet,
say, for miscellaneous.

92
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,503
Round that off to
475 feet of good rope.

93
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:50,715
Now, if we average
15 feet a day...

94
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,011
Plus, we have to build it,

95
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:58,806
we have to stock it,
we have to launch it.

96
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:03,603
That's gonna be tight.

97
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:05,647
That is not much time.

98
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:08,900
But we...

99
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:11,653
We live and we die by time,
don't we?

100
00:18:13,863 --> 00:18:17,742
Now, let's not commit the sin
of turning our back on time.

101
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:25,208
I know.

102
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,419
I know.

103
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:49,649
This is it.

104
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,113
That's all that's left.

105
00:18:55,196 --> 00:18:58,241
I checked over the whole island,
and that is all that's left.

106
00:18:58,491 --> 00:19:00,243
So we're gonna be short.

107
00:19:03,705 --> 00:19:05,623
Short.

108
00:19:12,672 --> 00:19:14,632
We'll just have to make some more
out of the videotape.

109
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:18,678
Yes.
No, we have time.

110
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:20,680
We do. We have time.
Look!

111
00:19:20,805 --> 00:19:22,932
The wind's still blowing in
from the west.

112
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:32,025
I know!

113
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:35,195
Yeah, I know-- I know where
there's 30 feet of extra rope!

114
00:19:35,278 --> 00:19:38,698
But... But I'm not
going back up there.

115
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:53,982
There, there.
There, you see? Huh?

116
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:56,734
There.
Are you happy?

117
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,245
Do you have to keep bringing that up?
Can't you just forget it?

118
00:21:07,328 --> 00:21:09,747
Huh? You were right.

119
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,293
You were right.
It was a good thing that we did a test,

120
00:21:13,585 --> 00:21:16,963
'cause it wasn't gonna be
just a quick little snap.

121
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:20,049
I would have landed
on the rocks.

122
00:21:20,175 --> 00:21:24,929
Broken my leg or my back or my neck.
Bled to death.

123
00:21:25,013 --> 00:21:27,724
But it was the only option I had
at the time though, okay?

124
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:30,268
It was what, a year ago?

125
00:21:30,351 --> 00:21:32,312
So let's just forget it.

126
00:21:36,983 --> 00:21:38,860
And what is your point?

127
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,198
Well...

128
00:21:43,323 --> 00:21:45,200
we might just make it.

129
00:21:45,325 --> 00:21:47,243
Did that thought
ever cross your brain?

130
00:21:49,037 --> 00:21:52,874
Well, regardless, I would rather take
my chance out there on the ocean

131
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:55,960
than to stay here and die
on this shithole island,

132
00:21:56,044 --> 00:22:01,257
spending the rest of my life
talking to a goddamn volleyball!

133
00:22:06,638 --> 00:22:08,389
Shut you up.

134
00:22:15,104 --> 00:22:18,900
Wilson! Wilson!

135
00:22:25,406 --> 00:22:27,742
Wilson!

136
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,162
Wilson!

137
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:33,164
Wilson!

138
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,877
Wilson.

139
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:41,840
Wilson!

140
00:22:43,091 --> 00:22:47,679
Oh, God! Wilson!

141
00:22:47,762 --> 00:22:49,681
Wilson!

142
00:22:55,186 --> 00:22:57,105
Oh! Oh!

143
00:22:57,188 --> 00:23:00,358
Never again.
Never again, never again.

144
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,695
You're okay.
You okay? Yeah.

145
00:23:22,463 --> 00:23:24,799
Yeah, I know you.

146
00:23:24,883 --> 00:23:27,218
I know you.
I know you.

147
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,393
So, we okay?

148
00:23:36,895 --> 00:23:38,938
Okay?

149
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:43,151
Okay.

150
00:25:20,456 --> 00:25:22,375
You still awake?

151
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,088
Me too.

152
00:25:34,637 --> 00:25:36,598
You scared?

153
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:41,853
Me too.

154
00:26:59,472 --> 00:27:02,475
Okay.
Here we go, Wilson.

155
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,687
You don't have to worry
about anything.

156
00:27:05,979 --> 00:27:08,064
I'll do all the paddling.

157
00:27:08,189 --> 00:27:10,108
You just hang on.

158
00:27:55,778 --> 00:27:59,240
Not yet!
Hold on!

159
00:28:10,084 --> 00:28:13,171
Not yet!
Not yet!

160
00:28:14,506 --> 00:28:16,508
Not yet!

161
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,264
Stand by, Wilson!

162
00:28:23,389 --> 00:28:26,184
Hold on!
Hold on, Wilson!

163
00:28:43,493 --> 00:28:46,579
I think we did it!

164
00:28:48,248 --> 00:28:50,834
I think we did it!

165
00:28:51,084 --> 00:28:52,836
Wilson!

166
00:28:55,296 --> 00:28:57,173
I think we did it!

167
00:32:29,302 --> 00:32:32,639
Oh! They're gone!

168
00:32:37,852 --> 00:32:39,771
I don't know why!

169
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:04,939
Where's Wilson?

170
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,777
Where's Wilson?

171
00:34:09,903 --> 00:34:11,779
Wilson, where are you?

172
00:34:13,531 --> 00:34:15,450
Wilson!

173
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,788
Wilson!

174
00:34:20,872 --> 00:34:23,041
Wilson!

175
00:34:50,443 --> 00:34:52,195
Wilson!

176
00:34:52,445 --> 00:34:54,781
I'm comin'!

177
00:34:56,658 --> 00:34:58,576
Wilson!

178
00:35:18,972 --> 00:35:20,974
Wilson!

179
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:23,601
Wilson...

180
00:35:28,147 --> 00:35:30,817
Wilson!

181
00:35:36,698 --> 00:35:39,200
Wilson! Wilson!

182
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:53,673
Wilson!

183
00:35:57,135 --> 00:35:59,012
Wilson!

184
00:35:59,137 --> 00:36:01,556
I'm sorry!

185
00:36:03,183 --> 00:36:05,143
I'm sorry, Wilson!

186
00:36:05,226 --> 00:36:07,854
Wilson, I'm sorry!

187
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:11,524
I'm sorry!

188
00:36:11,608 --> 00:36:13,693
Wilson!

189
00:36:13,818 --> 00:36:15,820
I can't!

190
00:36:15,945 --> 00:36:17,864
Wilson!

191
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:21,618
Wilson!

192
00:36:59,197 --> 00:37:01,866
I'm... I'm sorry.

193
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:06,788
I'm sorry.

194
00:37:08,665 --> 00:37:11,626
I'm sorry.

195
00:39:12,413 --> 00:39:14,374
Kelly.

196
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:21,840
Kelly.

197
00:39:23,216 --> 00:39:25,134
Kelly.

198
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,977
Hello?
Oh, how are you?

199
00:39:35,937 --> 00:39:37,856
Okay.

200
00:40:19,147 --> 00:40:22,025
Forty-five minutes.

201
00:40:22,108 --> 00:40:24,861
One Dr. Pepper.

202
00:40:24,944 --> 00:40:27,113
Two cups of ice.

203
00:40:27,155 --> 00:40:29,073
I like ice.

204
00:40:31,993 --> 00:40:33,786
Well, here's the drill.

205
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,789
Um, plane pulls in,
we get off,

206
00:40:36,915 --> 00:40:39,501
and there's a little ceremony
right there in the hangar.

207
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,296
Fred Smith
will say a few words.

208
00:40:43,338 --> 00:40:46,883
All you have to do is smile
and say "thank you."

209
00:40:48,301 --> 00:40:50,303
Then we'll take you over
to see Kelly.

210
00:40:53,014 --> 00:40:54,974
She's actually gonna
be there, huh?

211
00:40:56,309 --> 00:40:58,520
Well, that's what
we have arranged.

212
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,396
I mean, if you're sure
you wanna do that.

213
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,524
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yes.

214
00:41:06,903 --> 00:41:08,988
I don't know what
I'm gonna say to her.

215
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,784
What in the world
am I gonna say to her?

216
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,999
Chuck, Kelly had
to let you go.

217
00:41:20,124 --> 00:41:22,252
You know?

218
00:41:22,335 --> 00:41:25,129
She thought you were dead.

219
00:41:25,213 --> 00:41:27,173
And we buried you.

220
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:33,012
We had a funeral and a coffin
and a gravestone.

221
00:41:33,137 --> 00:41:35,056
The whole thing.

222
00:41:36,307 --> 00:41:38,226
You had a coffin?

223
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,939
What was in it?

224
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,985
Well, everybody put
something in.

225
00:41:47,068 --> 00:41:51,823
You know, just a cell phone
or a beeper, some pictures.

226
00:41:51,906 --> 00:41:53,992
I put in some Elvis CD's.

227
00:41:56,953 --> 00:41:58,872
So you had my funeral

228
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:03,918
and then you had
Mary's funeral.

229
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,343
Stan, I'm so sorry
I wasn't around when Mary died.

230
00:42:14,888 --> 00:42:18,516
I should've been there for you,
and I wasn't.

231
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:24,981
I'm so sorry.

232
00:42:25,064 --> 00:42:27,442
<i>Four years ago,</i>

233
00:42:27,567 --> 00:42:31,529
<i>the FedEx family lost
five of our sons.</i>

234
00:42:31,613 --> 00:42:34,866
<i>That was a terrible
and tragic day.</i>

235
00:42:35,909 --> 00:42:39,037
<i>But today,
one of those sons,</i>

236
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,999
<i>Chuck Noland,
has been returned to us.</i>

237
00:42:43,082 --> 00:42:45,210
<i>Chuck, welcome home.</i>

238
00:42:54,594 --> 00:42:58,890
<i>Just moments ago, Fred Smith
welcomed home Chuck Noland.</i>

239
00:42:58,973 --> 00:43:02,310
<i>- How about it, Michelle?
- It's such an incredible and amazing story</i>

240
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:06,105
<i>to come back from the dead.
- Well, it's so amazing that Smith
himself welcomed him back.</i>

241
00:43:06,189 --> 00:43:09,692
<i>And Fred acknowledged that,
"While time waits for no man,</i>

242
00:43:09,943 --> 00:43:12,695
<i>we take time to pause
to honor one of our own."</i>

243
00:43:12,946 --> 00:43:15,114
<i>Now, that's an expensive pause.</i>

244
00:43:23,164 --> 00:43:25,208
I'm-l'm sorry.
I must be in the wrong place.

245
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:28,086
No, you're in
the right place.

246
00:43:28,169 --> 00:43:32,423
You probably don't remember me.
I actually did root canal on you
about five years ago.

247
00:43:32,507 --> 00:43:34,634
Jim Spaulding referred you.

248
00:43:36,636 --> 00:43:38,513
Oh, yeah, yeah.

249
00:43:43,476 --> 00:43:45,395
I'm Kelly's husband.

250
00:43:47,146 --> 00:43:49,524
Jerry Lovett.

251
00:43:49,649 --> 00:43:52,610
Kelly wanted...

252
00:43:52,735 --> 00:43:54,654
Kelly wanted to be here...

253
00:43:57,365 --> 00:44:01,244
Look, this is very hard
for everyone.

254
00:44:01,327 --> 00:44:03,955
I can't even imagine
how hard it is for you.

255
00:44:08,668 --> 00:44:10,587
Kelly, uh...

256
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:15,216
She's had it rough.

257
00:44:15,341 --> 00:44:18,011
First when she thought
she lost you,

258
00:44:18,136 --> 00:44:20,013
and now dealing
with all of this.

259
00:44:20,138 --> 00:44:23,391
It's-lt's confusing.
It's very emotional for her.

260
00:44:23,516 --> 00:44:25,393
She's...

261
00:44:27,228 --> 00:44:30,565
She's... sort of lost.

262
00:44:33,193 --> 00:44:35,320
Maybe you could just
give her a little more time.

263
00:44:41,075 --> 00:44:43,244
Anyway, uh,

264
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:45,246
I'm sorry that...

265
00:45:42,637 --> 00:45:44,556
Okay, people, let's go.

266
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:46,850
Party's over. Let's go home.
Let's go home.

267
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,519
You're definitely
gonna have to go down to the DMV.

268
00:45:49,644 --> 00:45:52,230
Okay, Maynard, let's go.
Chuck's had a big day.

269
00:45:52,313 --> 00:45:54,315
- I have to brief this man
on his meetings tomorrow...
- I know.

270
00:45:54,399 --> 00:45:56,317
with the accountants
and the attorneys, all right?

271
00:45:56,401 --> 00:45:58,778
I will see you
bright and early in the morning.

272
00:45:58,862 --> 00:46:03,241
- Hey, Chuck, welcome home. We love you.
- Becca, I need to speak to you.

273
00:46:03,324 --> 00:46:06,828
You know, Chuck, we gotta catch up
on some of that fishin', now.

274
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,830
Take care.

275
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:14,085
- Good night.
- Good night.

276
00:46:17,172 --> 00:46:19,549
You got everything
you need? Okay.

277
00:46:19,632 --> 00:46:21,551
Well, if you need anything,
just sign for it,

278
00:46:21,634 --> 00:46:23,803
and I'll see you
in the morning.

279
00:46:24,095 --> 00:46:26,723
Get some sleep, okay?
We got another big day tomorrow.

280
00:46:26,848 --> 00:46:29,309
It takes a lot of paperwork
to bring back a man.

281
00:46:30,894 --> 00:46:34,314
- Bring you back to life, man.
- Bye, Chuck.

282
00:46:34,355 --> 00:46:36,524
- Take care, now.
- Tomorrow.

283
00:46:36,649 --> 00:46:38,776
Tomorrow we're gonna
bring you back to life.

284
00:48:23,715 --> 00:48:25,592
How long are you
gonna be, man?

285
00:48:28,344 --> 00:48:30,847
Well...

286
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:34,017
How long will that buy me?
- About ten minutes.

287
00:48:58,374 --> 00:49:00,376
I'm awake.

288
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,462
I saw your taxi drive up.

289
00:49:04,964 --> 00:49:06,883
Get in here
out of the rain.

290
00:49:13,973 --> 00:49:16,309
I saw you
down at the hub today,

291
00:49:16,392 --> 00:49:18,603
so I know you were down there.

292
00:49:36,955 --> 00:49:38,832
Let me get you a towel.

293
00:49:50,844 --> 00:49:52,762
They're sleeping.

294
00:49:56,558 --> 00:49:58,726
If you come in,
I'll make you some coffee.

295
00:50:12,365 --> 00:50:14,075
It's a nice house.

296
00:50:14,367 --> 00:50:16,077
Yeah, we got
a nice mortgage too.

297
00:50:23,918 --> 00:50:26,671
What's your daughter's name?

298
00:50:26,754 --> 00:50:29,340
Katie.

299
00:50:29,424 --> 00:50:31,342
Katie.

300
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:37,682
- She's a beautiful little girl.
- She's a handful.

301
00:50:51,988 --> 00:50:53,907
Just let me get
one thing straight here.

302
00:51:03,917 --> 00:51:07,086
We have a pro football team now,
but they're in Nashville?

303
00:51:12,759 --> 00:51:17,805
Um, yeah. Oh, my God. Okay.
They used to be in Houston.

304
00:51:17,889 --> 00:51:22,018
First they were the Oilers,
and now they're the Titans.

305
00:51:22,101 --> 00:51:24,771
The Houston Oilers
are the Tennessee Titans?

306
00:51:24,896 --> 00:51:26,773
Yeah.

307
00:51:26,898 --> 00:51:28,817
But that's not all.

308
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,861
They went to the Super Bowl
last year.

309
00:51:31,945 --> 00:51:34,572
- And I missed that.
- You would've died. It was so exciting.

310
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:38,076
They almost won by one yard.
One lousy yard right at the end.

311
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:43,832
I got whole milk,
2% and nonfat.

312
00:51:43,957 --> 00:51:46,125
I don'thave any half-and-half,
and that's what you like.

313
00:51:47,544 --> 00:51:49,462
That'll do fine.

314
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,727
What happened to you
becoming a professor?

315
00:52:06,771 --> 00:52:10,567
You're not
Dr. Kelly Frears-Lovett?

316
00:52:13,736 --> 00:52:16,114
When you, um...

317
00:52:16,197 --> 00:52:19,033
When your plane went down,

318
00:52:19,117 --> 00:52:21,452
everything just sort of
got put on hold.

319
00:52:24,205 --> 00:52:26,749
I think about
taking it up again, though.

320
00:52:38,928 --> 00:52:40,847
I came out here
to give you this.

321
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,559
Oh, my God.

322
00:52:46,644 --> 00:52:48,521
I'm sorry it doesn't work.

323
00:52:50,064 --> 00:52:52,859
And l, uh,
I kept the picture.

324
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:56,070
It was all faded anyway.

325
00:52:57,614 --> 00:53:00,241
I want you to have it.
I gave it to you.

326
00:53:00,533 --> 00:53:03,536
That's a family heirloom,
and it should stay in your family.

327
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:16,216
That's everything l have
from when you went down to now.

328
00:53:18,593 --> 00:53:21,012
They said they never figured out
what caused the crash.

329
00:53:21,095 --> 00:53:24,724
Probably some mislabeled
hazardous material caught fire.

330
00:53:29,062 --> 00:53:31,314
So here's where
that ship found you.

331
00:53:32,774 --> 00:53:35,860
You drifted about 500 miles.

332
00:53:35,985 --> 00:53:38,154
This is where
your island was,

333
00:53:38,238 --> 00:53:41,658
about 600 miles
south of the Cook lslands.

334
00:53:43,243 --> 00:53:45,537
And these are
the search grids.

335
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,331
Ships went back and forth
for weeks looking for you.

336
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:59,592
I never should've
gotten on that plane.

337
00:54:01,928 --> 00:54:04,305
I never should've
gotten out of the car.

338
00:54:08,226 --> 00:54:10,103
I wanna show you something.

339
00:54:12,272 --> 00:54:14,149
Come here.

340
00:54:23,908 --> 00:54:25,827
This is...
This is our car.

341
00:54:28,121 --> 00:54:30,081
You kept our car.

342
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:35,628
All right, now,
this is weird.

343
00:54:44,053 --> 00:54:46,139
It's a good car.

344
00:54:46,264 --> 00:54:48,641
Had a lot of memories
in this car.

345
00:54:48,766 --> 00:54:51,227
Two very nice memories.

346
00:54:51,311 --> 00:54:53,354
Oh, that trip
down to the Gulf, yeah.

347
00:54:56,024 --> 00:54:57,942
So, can I drive it?

348
00:54:58,026 --> 00:54:59,944
It's your car.

349
00:55:07,744 --> 00:55:10,830
That's good, 'cause my...
my taxi's gone.

350
00:55:17,003 --> 00:55:19,255
Um...

351
00:55:19,339 --> 00:55:21,257
Let me get some stuff
out of the back.

352
00:55:43,863 --> 00:55:46,199
You think you're gonna
have more kids?

353
00:55:46,282 --> 00:55:48,201
I don't know.

354
00:55:48,284 --> 00:55:51,162
It's kind of confusing
right now.

355
00:55:51,246 --> 00:55:53,998
Well, you should.

356
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,042
I mean, really,
you should.

357
00:55:58,419 --> 00:56:00,338
I would.

358
00:56:02,465 --> 00:56:04,384
So, what now?

359
00:56:07,428 --> 00:56:09,347
I don't know.

360
00:56:11,975 --> 00:56:13,893
I really don't know.

361
00:56:26,698 --> 00:56:28,408
You said
you'd be right back.

362
00:56:33,788 --> 00:56:35,748
I'm so sorry.

363
00:56:37,709 --> 00:56:39,419
Me too.

364
00:57:48,404 --> 00:57:50,323
Chuck!

365
00:57:54,244 --> 00:57:56,996
Chuck!

366
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,998
Chuck!

367
00:58:16,266 --> 00:58:18,184
I always knew you were alive.

368
00:58:18,268 --> 00:58:20,937
I knew it.

369
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:23,148
But everybody said
I had to stop saying that...

370
00:58:23,231 --> 00:58:25,233
that I had to let you go.

371
00:58:26,568 --> 00:58:29,487
I love you.

372
00:58:29,571 --> 00:58:31,447
You're the love of my life.

373
00:58:34,117 --> 00:58:36,035
I love you too, Kelly.

374
00:58:37,579 --> 00:58:39,497
More than you'll ever know.

375
00:59:40,517 --> 00:59:42,435
Chuck?

376
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:52,195
You have to go home.

377
01:00:40,493 --> 01:00:42,453
We both had done
the math, and...

378
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:47,333
Kelly added it all up.

379
01:00:49,085 --> 01:00:51,004
She knew she had
to let me go.

380
01:00:51,087 --> 01:00:55,341
I added it up,
knew that I'd...

381
01:00:55,466 --> 01:00:57,343
I'd lost her.

382
01:00:59,304 --> 01:01:01,472
'Cause I was never gonna
get off that island.

383
01:01:04,517 --> 01:01:07,145
I was gonna die there,

384
01:01:07,228 --> 01:01:09,147
totally alone.

385
01:01:15,528 --> 01:01:18,364
I mean, I was gonna get sick or
I was gonna get injured or something.

386
01:01:22,535 --> 01:01:24,454
The only choice I had,

387
01:01:27,248 --> 01:01:29,417
the only thing
I could control...

388
01:01:31,544 --> 01:01:35,048
was when and how...

389
01:01:35,173 --> 01:01:37,050
and where
that was gonna happen.

390
01:01:37,175 --> 01:01:41,554
So... I made a rope.

391
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:47,519
And I went up to the summit
to hang myself.

392
01:01:51,189 --> 01:01:53,233
But I had to test it,
you know?

393
01:01:53,358 --> 01:01:56,277
Of course.
You know me.

394
01:01:58,238 --> 01:02:00,156
And the weight of the log

395
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,451
snapped the limb
of the tree.

396
01:02:03,576 --> 01:02:05,495
So l-l...

397
01:02:05,578 --> 01:02:08,248
I couldn't even kill myself
the way I wanted to.

398
01:02:08,331 --> 01:02:11,251
I had power over nothing.

399
01:02:19,676 --> 01:02:23,263
And that's when this feeling
came over me like a warm blanket.

400
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:29,352
I knew...

401
01:02:29,477 --> 01:02:31,688
somehow...

402
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:34,190
that I had to stay alive.

403
01:02:35,733 --> 01:02:37,610
Somehow.

404
01:02:38,736 --> 01:02:41,114
I had to keep breathing,

405
01:02:43,616 --> 01:02:45,618
even though there was
no reason to hope.

406
01:02:47,787 --> 01:02:51,499
And all my logic said that
I would never see this place again.

407
01:02:56,421 --> 01:02:59,257
So that's what I did.

408
01:02:59,299 --> 01:03:01,759
I stayed alive.

409
01:03:01,843 --> 01:03:03,803
I kept breathing.

410
01:03:06,139 --> 01:03:08,349
And then one day
that logic was proven all wrong,

411
01:03:08,433 --> 01:03:10,351
because the tide...

412
01:03:12,479 --> 01:03:14,898
came in,
gave me a sail.

413
01:03:19,652 --> 01:03:21,571
And now, here I am.

414
01:03:24,866 --> 01:03:27,827
I'm back...

415
01:03:27,911 --> 01:03:30,497
in Memphis, talking to you.

416
01:03:32,624 --> 01:03:35,168
I have ice in my glass.

417
01:03:41,799 --> 01:03:44,260
And I've lost her
all over again.

418
01:03:52,143 --> 01:03:54,479
I'm so sad that
I don't have Kelly.

419
01:03:59,609 --> 01:04:02,904
But I'm so grateful that
she was with me on that island.

420
01:04:10,245 --> 01:04:12,330
And I know
what I have to do now.

421
01:04:15,291 --> 01:04:17,335
I gotta keep breathing.

422
01:04:19,879 --> 01:04:22,423
Because tomorrow,
the sun will rise.

423
01:04:23,675 --> 01:04:26,219
Who knows what the tide
could bring?

424
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:43,695
<i># l gave a letter to the postman#</i>

425
01:04:43,778 --> 01:04:45,697
<i># He put it in his sack#</i>

426
01:04:47,574 --> 01:04:50,660
<i># Bright and early
next morning#</i>

427
01:04:50,743 --> 01:04:53,413
<i># He brought my letter back#</i>

428
01:04:53,538 --> 01:04:55,456
<i>#She wrote upon it#</i>

429
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:57,458
<i># Return to sender#</i>

430
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:00,712
<i>#Address unknown#</i>

431
01:05:02,922 --> 01:05:04,841
<i># No such number##</i>

432
01:05:31,784 --> 01:05:33,703
Hello!

433
01:05:38,249 --> 01:05:39,959
Hello!

434
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,886
FedEx!

435
01:06:57,579 --> 01:07:00,623
- You look lost.
- I do?

436
01:07:00,748 --> 01:07:02,917
Where are you headed?

437
01:07:06,713 --> 01:07:08,631
Well, I was just about
to figure that out.

438
01:07:10,383 --> 01:07:12,594
Well, that's 83 South.

439
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:16,681
And this road here will
hook you up with l-40 East.

440
01:07:16,806 --> 01:07:18,975
If you turn right,

441
01:07:19,058 --> 01:07:22,812
that'll take you to
Amarillo, Flagstaff,

442
01:07:22,896 --> 01:07:24,814
California.

443
01:07:25,982 --> 01:07:27,901
And if you head back
that direction,

444
01:07:27,984 --> 01:07:30,987
you'll finda whole lotta nothin'
all the way to Canada.

445
01:07:33,072 --> 01:07:34,949
I got it.

446
01:07:35,074 --> 01:07:37,368
All right, then.

447
01:07:39,829 --> 01:07:41,748
Good luck, cowboy.

448
01:07:41,831 --> 01:07:43,666
Thank you.
