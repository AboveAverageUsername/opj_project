00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:42,937
Mrs. Peterson!

4
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,481
Ramon, hey!
How's it going?

5
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:47,816
How you doing?

6
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,902
There it is,
right there on the desk.

7
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:53,405
- Where's she headed?
- She's snowbound, Ramon.

8
00:02:57,201 --> 00:03:00,037
- See you went with the pink.
- Yeah, yeah.

9
00:03:00,162 --> 00:03:02,414
It's kind of
a pink day today.

10
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:05,209
I'm gonna have another pickup
for you on Thursday.

11
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,586
- All right. We'll see you then.
- All right. Thanks, Ramon.

12
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:10,130
<i>#Bless my soul
What's wrong with me#</i>

13
00:03:10,214 --> 00:03:13,509
<i>#I'm itchin' like a man
on a fuzzy tree#</i>

14
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:16,512
<i>#My friends say l'm actin'
wild as a bug#</i>

15
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:18,514
<i>#I'm in love##</i>

16
00:03:42,788 --> 00:03:45,499
Peterson! Peterson!

17
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:48,877
Peterson.

18
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:54,091
- Mr. Cowboy, da?
- Da.

19
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:01,682
Mmm, it's pretty.

20
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:04,852
Mmm.
It's from my wife.

21
00:05:11,293 --> 00:05:13,295
Time...

22
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:15,798
rules over us without mercy,

23
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:19,635
not caring if we're healthy or ill,
hungry or drunk,

24
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:23,264
Russian, American,
beings from Mars.

25
00:05:23,347 --> 00:05:26,225
It's like a fire. It could either
destroy us or keep us warm.

26
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,061
That's why every FedEx office
has a clock.

27
00:05:29,144 --> 00:05:31,981
Because we live or we
die by the clock.

28
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:33,983
We never turn our
back on it.

29
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:36,068
And we never, ever
allow ourselves

30
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:39,572
the sin of losing
track of time!

31
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:41,657
Locally, it's 1:56.

32
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:45,661
That means we've got
three hours and four minutes

33
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:47,663
before the end-of-the-day's
package sort.

34
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:52,001
That's how long we have.
That's how much time we have

35
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:55,004
before this pulsating, accursed,
relentless taskmaster

36
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:57,715
tries to put us
out of business.

37
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,843
Hey, Nicolai. Hey.
Nicolai, good to see you.

38
00:06:00,968 --> 00:06:02,845
How are you, kid?
Look what you did.

39
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:04,972
You just delivered
your very first FedEx package.

40
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:08,726
That deserves something special,
like a Snickers bar,

41
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:11,687
and a CD player.

42
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,689
And something to listen to -
a C.D. There.

43
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:16,400
Elvis Presley.
Fifty million fans can't be wrong.

44
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,402
You all recognize this,
don't you?

45
00:06:18,652 --> 00:06:21,196
I took the liberty
of sending this to myself.

46
00:06:21,322 --> 00:06:26,285
I FedEx'd it
before I left Memphis.

47
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:28,621
You're probably wondering
what could be in here.

48
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:30,956
What could it possibly be?
ls it architectural plans?

49
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:32,958
Maybe technical drawings?

50
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:35,836
Is this the new wallpaper
for the... For the bathroom?

51
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:40,716
It is... a clock.

52
00:06:40,758 --> 00:06:42,718
Which I started
at absolute zero

53
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:47,723
and is now at 87 hours,
22 minutes and 17 seconds.

54
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:52,728
From Memphis, America
to Nicolai in Russia, 87 hours.

55
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:55,940
Eighty-seven hours
is a shameful outrage.

56
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:59,068
This is just an egg timer!

57
00:06:59,193 --> 00:07:01,946
What if it had been something else?
Like your paycheck?

58
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:05,115
Or fresh boysenberries?
Or adoption papers?

59
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,243
Eighty-seven hours
is an eternity.

60
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,245
The cosmos was created
in less time!

61
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,122
Wars have been fought and
nations toppled in 87 hours!

62
00:07:12,248 --> 00:07:14,166
Fortunes made and squandered.

63
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:20,256
What?

64
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,258
What are you saying
about me?

65
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,301
I tell them,
what do they expect?

66
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:28,097
This man, when his truck broke down,
he stole a boy's bicycle to do his delivery.

67
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,933
I borrowed it!
I borrowed a kid's bike.

68
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:34,144
And I got my packages delivered,
and that is what you people
are gonna have to start doing.

69
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:37,815
You have to start doing
whatever it takes, because
in three hours and two minutes

70
00:07:37,898 --> 00:07:40,943
every one of these packages
has to be on the big truck

71
00:07:41,068 --> 00:07:42,987
and on its way
to the airport.

72
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,447
Fifteen minutes!

73
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:48,993
- Crunch time! Crunch time!
- Crunch time!

74
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:52,246
Let's go! Every package
on the airport truck.

75
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:54,373
Go!
Crunch, crunch, crunch!

76
00:07:54,498 --> 00:07:56,375
- We have a big problem.
- What?

77
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,211
- The truck in Red Square is stuck.
- What do you mean?

78
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:01,964
- It's stuck.
- Stuck how? In snow? In ice?

79
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,467
It's stuck! The most important truck,
the Kremlin truck! Many packages.

80
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,938
All right, all right, all right.
Let's put the table right here.

81
00:08:18,022 --> 00:08:19,940
We'll just do the sort.

82
00:08:20,024 --> 00:08:23,152
Ah, yeah, a clamp.
That would make us stuck.

83
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:25,863
Let's go. Unload.
Get him out ofthere.

84
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:28,365
Right here.
Two lines, two lines.

85
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,368
One to the airport truck,
one to the Moscow truck.

86
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:33,162
Got it?

87
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:36,874
C.D.G., F.E., M.E,
Memphis on the airport truck.
Everything else right there.

88
00:08:36,957 --> 00:08:39,501
Nicolai ! Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Four minutes.

89
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:44,465
<i>Hi, this is Kelly. If you're
calling for Chuck, press one.</i>

90
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:46,842
<i>Otherwise leave a message
after the tone. Thanks.</i>

91
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,886
<i>Hello, Kelly. Are you there?</i>

92
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:51,388
<i>Pick up, pick up, pick up,
pick up. You're not there.</i>

93
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:54,433
<i>You're not gonna believe this. I'm doin'
the sorts in the middle of Red Square</i>

94
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:56,435
<i>in the shadow
of Lenin's tomb.</i>

95
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,437
<i>#l miss you#</i>

96
00:08:58,562 --> 00:09:00,522
#I miss you
I really wanna kiss you#

97
00:09:00,814 --> 00:09:03,484
I'm outta here in two minutes and
I'm pickin' up the sweep through Paris,

98
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,237
so I should be back in Memphis
about 18 hours or so.

99
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,405
That's the good news.
The bad news is

100
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:10,407
I gotta go to
the dentist this week.

101
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:12,409
I got something in there
that's hurtin'.

102
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:15,329
I love you and I'm gonna see you soon,
and you know what that means.

103
00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:18,082
Bye-bye. Nicolai! Tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock!

104
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:39,561
I absolutely, positively
have to get to Memphis tonight.

105
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,855
Can't help you.
Try U.P.S.

106
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:44,441
With this extra head wind, are we gonna
be able to push it and make the sort?

107
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:47,027
- We'll do our best.
- "Our best," huh?

108
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:51,282
Gwen, is there something wrong
with our doctors that Jack
keeps getting certified to fly?

109
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:53,826
- Aren't you concerned?
- I'm terrified.

110
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:55,869
But a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

111
00:09:55,953 --> 00:09:58,831
That's the spirit.
Relentless is our goal. Relentless!

112
00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:02,042
What do you expect from the guy
who stole a crippled kid's bicycle

113
00:10:02,126 --> 00:10:04,378
when his truck broke down?
- I borrowed it.

114
00:10:04,461 --> 00:10:06,547
But I love that
the kid's now crippled.

115
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,216
So you missed the last truck
by two minutes?

116
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,177
Two minutes.
Actually, it was less than that.

117
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:15,180
The plane wasn't that heavy.
You could've added some fuel,

118
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:17,182
picked up the speed
and made up the time.

119
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:20,394
It's about the trucks.
Today's truck was two minutes late.

120
00:10:20,477 --> 00:10:23,480
Tomorrow's will be four minutes late,
and then six minutes and eight minutes late.

121
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:27,526
- Next thing you know, we're the U.S. Mail.
- Yeah, well...

122
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:30,195
All I'm sayin' is, if you'd
gotten all those trucks on the plane,

123
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:33,073
those Russkies would be
walking on water right now.

124
00:10:33,157 --> 00:10:35,534
Hey, don't...
Don't gimme that look.

125
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:38,162
- It's just grape juice. Right, Chuck?
- Yeah.

126
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:41,290
It's like a 1992
full-bodied grape juice.

127
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:43,542
I see no evil, hear no evil,
speak no evil.

128
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:47,087
We'd offer you some but, you know,
somebody's got to fly the plane.

129
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:50,507
Yeah, well,
I "just say no," right?

130
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:53,427
Listen, Stan,
I've been meaning to ask you.

131
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,512
How's Mary?

132
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:59,016
Oh. Uh, well,

133
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:02,144
we really don't know anything yet.
- Mm-hmm.

134
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:07,149
Uh, she went to
the doctor yesterday, and, uh,

135
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:11,028
it hasn't meta...
metastasized...

136
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:14,073
as far as they
can tell right now.

137
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:17,076
It's just kind of
wait and see.

138
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:19,286
I'm so sorry.

139
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:22,539
Tell her I'm gonna come by
and see her on my next layover.

140
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:26,043
I want you to know, Stan,
we are all thinking about her and you.

141
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:28,712
- And just blessings.
- Thank you, Gwen.

142
00:11:28,963 --> 00:11:31,465
<i>Hi, this is Kelly. If you're
calling for Chuck, press one.</i>

143
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:34,468
<i>Otherwise, leave a message
after the tone. Thanks.</i>

144
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:42,434
Stan.

145
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,062
Listen.
Uh, I heard about this...

146
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,025
I heard about this doctor
down in Emory, in Atlanta.

147
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,027
Uh, he's supposed to be
the absolute best.

148
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,154
He worked on
Frank Toretta's wife.

149
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,198
Frank Toretta is
a systems analyst.

150
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,617
He played center field for us.
You know him.

151
00:11:58,742 --> 00:12:01,412
In the softball tournament
last Labor Day.

152
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:03,372
Anyway, beside the point.

153
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:08,085
Uh, what I was thinking is,
is that I could get his number...

154
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:10,671
of the doctor...
and, uh,

155
00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:13,257
you know,
put you all together and...

156
00:12:14,758 --> 00:12:17,261
You know, you could
get this thing fixed.

157
00:12:17,344 --> 00:12:19,263
You could beat it.

158
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:22,474
Thanks, Chuck.

159
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,144
So, I'll get his number.

160
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:51,378
- Is Kelly Frears around?
- She's copying her dissertation.

161
00:13:22,826 --> 00:13:25,287
- You're home.
- Home indeed.

162
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,289
I love that you're home.

163
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:50,396
<i>Just days before Santa departs
on his annual gift-giving venture,</i>

164
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:53,399
<i>he's been declared
physically fit to fly.</i>

165
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:57,319
<i>Santa got checked out by doctors at
the V.A. Hospital in Augusta, Georgia.</i>

166
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,281
<i>After they declared
the jolly old elfin tip top shape,</i>

167
00:14:00,364 --> 00:14:03,784
<i>Santa Claus took off into the wild
blue yonder for an early start.</i>

168
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:06,412
<i>In Sarajevo,
he spent the day with children,</i>

169
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:09,373
<i>handing out presents and
even helping them decorate</i>

170
00:14:09,456 --> 00:14:11,375
<i>the special Christmas tree.</i>

171
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:17,840
<i>Santa and a sea of elves
took over the floor</i>

172
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,842
<i>at the Hong Kong
Futures Exchange.</i>

173
00:14:19,883 --> 00:14:22,344
<i>Market traders
bought Santa hats, donating...</i>

174
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:46,827
The turkey's a little dry,
isn't it?

175
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:49,455
- No.
- The turkey is perfect.

176
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,545
- How many did you do last night?
- Last night? 2.9 million.

177
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:00,215
Now you've got to be in the market
for more of these candied yams.

178
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:01,675
Here you go.

179
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,761
2.9 has got to be
the record.

180
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,763
Look at those marshmallows.

181
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,806
When I was there,
we did two million.

182
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,434
- We thought that was a big deal.
- The glory days.

183
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,145
- What'd they do the first night?
- The very first night?

184
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,147
- Twelve.
- Twelve thousand?

185
00:15:15,272 --> 00:15:17,775
- Hell, no. Twelve.
- That's right.

186
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:20,611
And they did the sort
right there on a card table.

187
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:23,447
And Fred Smith had
that card table bronzed.

188
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:26,283
I've been hearing that
for five years.

189
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:30,496
- It's in his office today.
- They go from that to
the new hub up in Anchorage.

190
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:32,498
It's state of the art.
A perfect marriage

191
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:34,959
between technology
and systems management.

192
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:37,795
Speaking of marriage, Chuck,
when are you gonna make
an honest woman out of Kelly?

193
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,217
- How long?
- Fourteen minutes into the meal.

194
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,470
- You won. I owe you $5.
- So I win.

195
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:48,555
- Way before the pie.
- I told him on the way up.

196
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,725
Right about the time
the pie came out, the marriage...

197
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:54,812
Kelly is still recovering from her
failed relationship with that parolee.

198
00:15:54,895 --> 00:15:57,189
He was a lawyer.

199
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:59,483
I knew it had something to do
with raising your right hand

200
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,485
and swearing
to tell the truth.

201
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:04,613
Remember when he fell on the sidewalk and
broke his shoulder at the wedding reception ?

202
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,491
He tripped on a curb
holding a door open for me.

203
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:10,828
- Aunt Kelly was married before?
- It's not even worth remembering.

204
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:13,831
So since her failed marriage
to the parolee...

205
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:18,836
- Oh, my God.
- Kelly can't see being with a man
who wears a pager to bed.

206
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:20,921
What're you gonna
attach it to, Hoss?

207
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:23,841
When you wear it to bed, l hope
you got one of those things

208
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:25,843
that go vibratin'.

209
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,387
Watch it.
I'm not touching that.

210
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:31,807
Oh, did you
hit an olive pit?

211
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:36,020
- I thought I took all of them out.
- No, no, it's not that.

212
00:17:02,546 --> 00:17:04,715
- Okay, I'll cancel Saturday.
- No, don't.

213
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,759
If I'm not here, I'm not.
But if I am, well,

214
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:08,761
- then I am.
- It's cancelled.

215
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:10,721
But you gotta be here
New Year's Eve.

216
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:13,307
Malaysia can't be that bad.
I'll be here New Year's Eve.

217
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,768
- When are you defending
your dissertation?
-January 12.

218
00:17:15,893 --> 00:17:20,356
I'm gonna have to
switch over the South America thing.

219
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,733
If I do that
on the third or fourth,

220
00:17:22,816 --> 00:17:24,735
I'm gonna have to head
back out on the 13th.

221
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:26,987
So long as you're here
New Year's Eve.

222
00:17:27,071 --> 00:17:30,032
I will be here New Year's Eve.
I promise.

223
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:37,748
- What?
- What about our Christmas?
I got a gift for you.

224
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:42,920
We have to do it
in the car.

225
00:17:43,045 --> 00:17:48,092
<i>#You'll be doing all right#</i>

226
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:51,387
I'd just like a minute over here,
all right? Thanks.

227
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:57,851
<i>#But I'll have a blue#</i>

228
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,396
- #Blue, blue, blue Christmas#
- Two minutes, okay?

229
00:18:00,437 --> 00:18:02,940
Two more minutes.
Thanks. Hey!

230
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,526
- Merry Christmas.
- I thought you were gonna stiff me.

231
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:08,404
- No.
- What is the ribbon?
ls it a thousand-pound

232
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,782
test fishing line or something ?
- Here's your fancy thing.

233
00:18:11,865 --> 00:18:14,618
Thanks.

234
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:19,665
I love the wrapping.

235
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,335
- And I love the box.
- Good.

236
00:18:25,963 --> 00:18:29,967
Oh. Oh, my.

237
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:33,053
Oh, that is terrific.

238
00:18:33,137 --> 00:18:35,681
My grandaddy used it
on the Southern Pacific.

239
00:18:38,434 --> 00:18:42,396
Hey, I took this. This is
my favorite picture of you.

240
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:46,859
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm always gonna keep this

241
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:49,653
on Memphis time.

242
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:54,533
Kelly time.

243
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:56,577
Hmm.

244
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,662
You haven't said anything about
your presents. Is there a problem?

245
00:18:58,746 --> 00:19:00,789
I'm sorry, no!
I love 'em.

246
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,000
Look at my journal.
Ah!

247
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,879
- What about the pager?
- Real leather.
The pages have gold on 'em.

248
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:09,006
- Did you like the pager or not?
- Yes.

249
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:12,843
I love it. Look at him in
his little blue Russian house.

250
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:15,846
- It's from Russia.
- My God.

251
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,433
- It's not one of those loud ones ?
- No. You can program it so it vibrates

252
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,977
and lights up
and see it in the dark.

253
00:19:22,102 --> 00:19:26,106
It seems like
a real nice pager.

254
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:29,902
- Sorry about the hand towels.
You're hard to shop for.
- No, no. I love 'em.

255
00:19:29,985 --> 00:19:33,989
- Every time I wash my hands, I will think of you.
- All right, l gotta go.

256
00:19:34,114 --> 00:19:38,035
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

257
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:40,037
- I love you.
- I love you too.

258
00:19:47,711 --> 00:19:50,506
Chuck! Keys!

259
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:03,519
- Thank you.
- That reminds me. I almost forgot.

260
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,939
I have one more present
for you.

261
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:12,152
Only this isn't an open-in-the-car
kind of present.

262
00:20:12,236 --> 00:20:14,154
Like, say, hand towels.

263
00:20:14,238 --> 00:20:16,740
Which were a joke,
by the way.

264
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,539
I'm terrified.

265
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:26,667
Just take it and hold onto it,
and you can open it

266
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,461
on New Year's Eve.

267
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:31,463
And I love you.

268
00:20:35,175 --> 00:20:37,928
I'll be right back.

269
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:24,516
Hey, Al, where are we?

270
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:26,560
Somewhere over
the Pacific Ocean.

271
00:21:26,644 --> 00:21:29,104
Ha, ha, ha!
You pilots, you're funny.

272
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,565
Tahiti Control,
FedEx 88.

273
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:34,318
Position Jenna
at 1526...

274
00:21:34,568 --> 00:21:37,529
Is all this turbulence from Santa
and those eight tiny reindeer?

275
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:40,074
Tamara at 1620.

276
00:21:40,157 --> 00:21:42,534
Eric is next.

277
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,120
Fuel: niner-five-decimal-five.

278
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,581
Blaine, tell them we're
deviating south for weather.

279
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:49,959
Make another position plot
on your deviation left.

280
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,544
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

281
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,172
Position Jenna at 1526.

282
00:21:55,256 --> 00:21:57,716
- Flight level 350.
- I got us plotted.

283
00:21:57,841 --> 00:22:00,719
We're 200 miles south
of our original course.

284
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:03,555
Continue plotting,
and check contingency procedures.

285
00:22:03,681 --> 00:22:05,599
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:08,018
Broadcasting in the blind.
How do you read?

287
00:22:08,102 --> 00:22:10,604
l've never been out
of comm this long.

288
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,691
Did you try the higher
H.F. frequency?

289
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:16,151
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

290
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:19,154
Better buckle up, Chuck.
It's gonna get bumpy.

291
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,074
Tahiti Control,
FedEx 88.

292
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:24,201
Do you read?

Tahiti Control,
FedEx 88.

294
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,881
Position Jenna at 1526.

295
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:39,967
Flight level 350.

296
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,969
Expecting Tamara at 1..

297
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:26,180
Fire! Explosion!

298
00:23:26,263 --> 00:23:28,182
Let's get a hose!

299
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:34,104
Hold on to it!
Come on!

300
00:23:36,357 --> 00:23:38,400
Seat belt!

301
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:47,701
We may have to ditch!

302
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,171
Okay?

303
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,715
Fire in the hold!

304
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,801
We're goin' down!

305
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,136
Mayday! Mayday!

306
00:24:16,772 --> 00:24:19,024
Bringing it down and out!

307
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:22,111
Ten thousand feet!
Masks off!

308
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,446
Masks off!

309
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,868
Chuck! Life vest!

310
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:04,737
Chuck!
Chuck, stay there!

311
00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:07,531
Where's your life vest?

312
00:25:31,305 --> 00:25:33,224
Ditching switch on!

313
00:25:47,363 --> 00:25:50,032
I've got visual!

314
00:25:54,203 --> 00:25:56,538
Brace for impact!

315
00:34:48,862 --> 00:34:51,031
Hello!

316
00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:34,885
Hello!

317
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,929
Anybody!

318
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:50,609
Anybody!

319
00:36:55,072 --> 00:36:57,825
Help!

320
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,868
Help!

321
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,747
What is that?

322
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:14,295
Hey!

323
00:39:26,015 --> 00:39:27,933
Hey!

324
00:39:28,017 --> 00:39:30,603
Anybody?

325
00:43:42,146 --> 00:43:44,273
Hello?

326
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,176
Get! Go, go.
Go! Go!

327
00:48:39,151 --> 00:48:41,946
Albert R. Miller

328
00:48:42,196 --> 00:48:45,324
Not Alan. Albert.

329
00:50:05,863 --> 00:50:08,032
So, that's it.

330
00:53:04,041 --> 00:53:06,043
Hey! A ship!

331
00:53:06,168 --> 00:53:08,504
Hey! Hey!

332
00:53:08,587 --> 00:53:10,506
Hey! Hey!

333
00:53:10,589 --> 00:53:12,883
A ship! Over here!

334
00:53:13,008 --> 00:53:16,178
