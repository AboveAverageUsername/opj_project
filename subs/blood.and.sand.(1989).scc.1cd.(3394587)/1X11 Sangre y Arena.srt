3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,000
Let's get ready to rumble!

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,700
>From the jewel at the heart
of the fabulous Las Vegas Strip...

5
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,300
the Montecito Resort and Casino
is proud to present...

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,400
12 rounds of World Championship Boxing!

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,500
Introducing first, in the blue corner...

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,900
wearing red and weighing 154 pounds...

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,400
he has 32 victories,
including 28 knockouts without a loss.

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,200
Originally from Ghana,
now fighting out of Birmingham, England...

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,800
here is the undefeated challenger...

12
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,400
Cedric "The Cannonball" Barimba.

13
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,200
There he is!

14
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,800
Now making his entrance
into the ring in the red corner...

15
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,700
wearing gold with green...

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,000
officially weighing in
at 153 and one half pounds...

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,900
Hey, Ed, would you like
to watch the fight from the corner?

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,500
I'd love to, but I gotta take care
of some big shot.

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Take him out of there.
You got it.

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,100
The pride
of Pomona, California...

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,400
the reigning and defending...

22
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,300
Super Welterweight Champion of the World...

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,700
Sugar Shane...

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,500
Mosley!

25
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,700
One word and you're dead.

26
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,500
Fighters, I gave you your rules
in the dressing room, watch the head butts.

27
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,900
Watch the low blows. Let's touch them
and have a clean fight. Let's go!

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,500
Mosley's had trouble
with his left hand.

29
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,400
I wonder if it'll affect his performance.

30
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,200
We'll soon see, Bob.

31
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,300
Absolutely.

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,800
And there's the bell.
Both fighters right into the centre of the ring.

33
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,900
Going at it pretty hard. Mosley circling left.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That left hand looks pretty good there.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,900
Mosley's almost smiling.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,600
There's real anger
between these two.

37
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,200
Barimba's coming
right back, though.

38
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,300
Both on their toes.
Oh, Barimba! Sharp jab followed by a cross.

39
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,500
Doesn't look like Mosley even felt that.

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,500
Both fighters now exchanging blows.

41
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,500
Mosley drives Barimba
to the ropes. Hard punches to his body.

42
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,000
Like they say,
"Hit the body, and the head will follow."

43
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,000
They can't keep up
this pace!

44
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,400
Does boxing get any better than this?
No, sir!

45
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,400
Barimba goes hard
to the body.

46
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,700
He's got him on
the ropes! Mosley, right to the midsection.

47
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Shane! How's the left hand?

48
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,300
Any chance the fight'll be cancelled?

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,500
You don't secure a place in boxing history...

50
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
by ducking fights with a cross-dresser.

51
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,800
These guys hate each other.

52
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,200
Unfortunately for Cedric...

53
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,500
the way my combinations connect,
he'll be changing his makeup every round.

54
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,400
If there's any trouble up there,
you can keep these posses apart, right?

55
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,000
You want me to crutch them?

56
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,600
- Why don't I hit their fists with my face?
- Cedric, any comment?

57
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,000
I have four babies by three different women.

58
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,600
I'm working on a fifth with Mosley's old lady.

59
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,200
Hey, Barimba. You left this in the locker.

60
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,700
Hey, Barimba, what size is that?

61
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,700
I have no doubt the Mosley bout's okay...

62
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,300
but there's something going on
with the prelim fight.

63
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Sports book keeps
dropping the odds on Riggs.

64
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,900
The guy he's fighting's a nobody.

65
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,500
- Shouldn't even be in the same ring.
- $2.5 million in the last two hours.

66
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,000
On an under card?

67
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,000
Hey, listen. Move as much
as you can, all right?

68
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,000
Why don't you go talk to the guy?

69
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,100
I mean, he's a local.
Maybe you'll have the good fortune...

70
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,300
of finding out if he's gonna tank or not.

71
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,900
What if he cracks me in the mouth?

72
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,000
If he cracks you, that would be a good
indication he's on the level, no?

73
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,800
All right.

74
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,000
- Danny.
- Yeah?

75
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,300
Don't forget your mouthpiece.

76
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,000
Mr. Herman.

77
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,400
This is what's great
about Vegas on Fight Weekend.

78
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,500
It makes Ancient Rome look
like a Mormon dental convention.

79
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,000
If you and your wife are gonna make
your tee time, you should get going.

80
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,600
- Car's waiting right outside.
- Oh, geez, you're right.

81
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,400
Honey, we have to go.

82
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,400
She asked Lisa to stay with us
for the weekend.

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Nice. Sometimes dreams
do come true, right?

84
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,600
I guess I'm gonna need three tickets
for the big fight.

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,100
What?

86
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Hey, Mary, listen.

87
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,400
I'm gonna need an extra ticket
for the Mosley fight.

88
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,500
I'm serious.
Mr. Herman gambles at least $1 million...

89
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,700
With two girlfriends?

90
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,400
One's his wife, and neither wants
the threesome split up.

91
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,900
He gambles at least $1 million
on a fight weekend...

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,700
so we want to keep him happy.

93
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,300
The tickets were gone a month ago.
He already got two, that's all he'll get.

94
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
No. Mary, I'm asking for one...
I can't.

95
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,700
One ticket!

96
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,900
Danny McCoy. Dad, hey.

97
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,300
Leg's good. It's good.

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,900
There's a problem on the job?

99
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,700
All right. I'll try to get there
as soon as I can. All right.

100
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,100
Never make me go to the gym again.

101
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm telling you. You should have taken
that yoga class with me and Mike.

102
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,400
- It was really good.
- Yeah, it was.

103
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,700
What did you do?

104
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,700
Some tae kwon do, a little kickboxing.

105
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,600
What, did you think I'll sit on
a sweaty bicycle seat? I don't think so.

106
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,000
What's that?

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,800
Ladies, I'm no detective,
but I think it's some kind of gym bag.

108
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,500
Probably some stinky gym clothes.

109
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,000
Coleman Riggs.

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
Hey, man. I'm Danny McCoy.
I work at the Montecito.

111
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,700
- Bring the towels?
- No. But I'll make sure you get some.

112
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,500
I grew up close to where
you used to live, on Sycamore.

113
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,600
Yeah. I'm from Vegas, too.

114
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,800
I dated a girl that lived on the street
named after you.

115
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,700
Yeah. I'm a real hometown hero.

116
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,700
I got your autograph
after the Kappa fight.

117
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,400
That uppercut you hit him with
was like an H-bomb.

118
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,900
It was unbelievable.
Thanks. Appreciate it.

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,300
Yeah. Mr. Riggs...

120
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,200
the Montecito views itself
as the premier gaming resort in Las Vegas.

121
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,200
Obviously, every fight that we hold
has to be above reproach.

122
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,100
"The war to settle the score."

123
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,800
That's why I'm here.

124
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,500
There's been an irregular pattern
of betting on your match.

125
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,500
- Everybody's betting on me, huh?
- No. No, actually...

126
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,200
the other way around.

127
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Has anyone approached you
about throwing the fight?

128
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,500
The ring is where I live. Understand?

129
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,900
- Yeah. I don't mean any disrespect.
- The ring is my home.

130
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,900
A man doesn't disrespect his home.

131
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,000
The only thing you gonna see me throwing
is my H-bomb to his jawbone.

132
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,900
I hear you talking that trash again...

133
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,400
I'll break your other leg.

134
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,800
Henderson's looking
to the end zone. Dillman's got the catch.

135
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,500
Unbelievable!

136
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,500
He said all the right things,
but he wouldn't look me in the eye, so...

137
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,800
Is the number on him still dropping?

138
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
I'll tell you in a sec, here.

139
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,400
Riggs is minus 550. I'm gonna...

140
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,500
pull his financial records.
The guy could be in a jam or something.

141
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,700
Listen...

142
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,100
I was gonna stop by my dad's job site today.

143
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,800
He's been having some problems.

144
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,700
Correct me if I'm misunderstanding.

145
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,500
You're asking for time off
during Fight Weekend?

146
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,100
Are you sniffing glue?

147
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,100
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important, Ed.

148
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
If you need me, I'll be back in 10 minutes.

149
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,700
No, if I need you,
you'll be back in five minutes.

150
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,200
Okay. While I'm out,
I'll talk to Riggs' sparring partner.

151
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,700
- See how hard he's been training.
- It'll still count as a full day off.

152
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,100
What the hell's that?

153
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,900
Paul, come on.
What are you doing in there?

154
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,600
Hey, which one of you guys
is Riggs' sparring partner?

155
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,300
Thanks.

156
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,500
- Riggs ain't here.
- Yeah, I know.

157
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,500
- Listen...
- Are you his doctor?

158
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,900
What does he need a doctor for?

159
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,300
Hey, I'm not a cop,
and I'm not with the Boxing Commission.

160
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,600
Look. He was jumping rope.

161
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,200
He almost fell down.
He said he wasn't feeling good.

162
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,700
And then he left.

163
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,700
- You know who his doctor is?
- Ange would know. Right over there.

164
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,700
Thanks.

165
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,100
I say we go shopping.

166
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,500
Aren't you at all worried about bad karma?

167
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,400
Something tells me
she's a finder's-keepers type of girl.

168
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,200
My mom did not raise a thief...

169
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,900
and something about this feels like
we're stealing from somebody.

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,900
Stealing? How is it stealing?

171
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,300
This money was left there for us to find.

172
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,200
Yeah, it's not stealing so long
as we make an honest effort...

173
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,800
to find out who it belongs to.

174
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,600
This money represents a fantasy for us.

175
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,200
Mine's shopping. Nessa, what's yours?

176
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,300
A string of Mikimoto pearls.
Now, Mike...

177
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,100
what would you do with the money?

178
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,800
What's your fantasy?

179
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,400
I don't know. That's nice.

180
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,300
Think about it.

181
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,600
You're right.
There's no harm in contemplating a little.

182
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,000
You know what I'd do?
DELINDA: What?

183
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,000
I'd take you ladies to Tahiti.
NESSA: Oh!

184
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,100
I'd pay a local fisherman
to ferry us to a secret beach...

185
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,000
tell him to leave us there...

186
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,400
and then I'd take all your clothes...

187
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,800
and burn them.

188
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,800
And then?
Then I'd burn all my clothes, too.

189
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,800
 Ouch!
Now you're talking.

190
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,000
Now, lie back.

191
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,200
Get used to it.

192
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,600
You're on a beach lined with money.

193
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,300
Feels pretty good, right?

194
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,700
That feels pretty good.

195
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,100
Good. Now pretend you're
on that beach a moment longer.

196
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,200
- Okay, now let's go shopping.
- That's cold.

197
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,200
That's cold.

198
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,000
Hey, did you find Riggs' doctor?
Yeah.

199
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,200
He's got a subdural haematoma.

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,500
This guy passed the physical.
How did he get a licence?

201
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,900
But that doesn't mean
he's gonna throw the fight.

202
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,700
You know? See, you're a...

203
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,400
glass-half-full kind of a guy.
That's very nice...

204
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,700
but whether he dumps the fight or not,
doesn't matter, he's done.

205
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,200
So notify the Boxing Commission, okay?

206
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,500
- Did you get anything on his finances?
- Yes, he's broke.

207
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,100
Legit fight'd probably kill him,
so he figured he'd just cash in.

208
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,100
Too bad. He seems like a pretty good guy.

209
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,300
He is a pretty good guy.

210
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,100
I've known a lot of pretty good guys
that did a lot of bad things.

211
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
I just wanted to let you know about Riggs.

212
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,300
- I'm gonna head back to see my dad.
- Yeah, that's cool.

213
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,300
We have a problem on Blackjack 6.

214
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,800
Move in now. God, everybody, move!

215
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,300
Everybody. Move in!

216
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,100
Let's go in now.

217
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,700
Get this chair.

218
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,300
Mr. Scanlan. Please accept my apologies.

219
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,900
I believe we have
most of the offenders in custody.

220
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,300
- If you want to file a report...
- You're damn right I would.

221
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,900
They took my leg.
They took your...

222
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,300
Oh.

223
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,700
If you bring in another backhoe
over the weekend you can...

224
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,200
make Phase 3 by Monday night at the latest.

225
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,000
Form it up and pour Wednesday.

226
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,800
Yeah. Concrete needs a week's notice.

227
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,900
Charlie still over there?

228
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,700
I took care of him when his bachelor party
went overboard. He owes me. Yeah?

229
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,900
What?

230
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,800
They took a prosthetic leg?

231
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,400
All right. I'll get there as soon as I can.

232
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,200
Sorry, Pops. I gotta take off.
I'll try to get back later.

233
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,200
Don't worry about it.
This isn't your job anymore.

234
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,000
The job of a son is to help out his old man.

235
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,400
- You better get to work.
- I'll call Charlie from the road.

236
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,000
I didn't see nothing.

237
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,700
One of them blindsided me,
and the other one pulled off my leg.

238
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,900
Look...

239
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,400
I'm running all the surveillance tapes,
so we will identify the thief...

240
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,200
and locate your limb there.

241
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,400
Just give me five minutes with those bums.

242
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,400
Hey, it's custom-fitted.
It took months to make.

243
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,400
I promise you. We will find it.

244
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,600
You better.

245
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,400
Can't go into the ring
with a cut man who can't stand up.

246
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,200
No leg, no fight.

247
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,900
Understood.

248
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,800
All right, play it frame by frame.

249
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Hey.

250
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,700
Want your other foot broken?
Get it off my desk.

251
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Your shoe's dirty.
Have it shined before you go on the floor.

252
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,200
And change that sock.

253
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,100
So. What about our leg thief?

254
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,500
I played this thing at least 20 times.

255
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,800
Once the melee starts, everything's blocked.

256
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,900
I mean, you can see a guy taking the leg...

257
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,600
but you can't see who it is.

258
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,200
And I'm playing it frame by frame by frame.

259
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,500
Wait a minute. Stop it right there.

260
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,500
Now push in on that.

261
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,300
- See that? His face is blocked.
- Yeah.

262
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,100
Go in as tight as you can right now.

263
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,000
Stop right there. See that piece
of chrome on that picture over there?

264
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,700
Move left, and push in on that.
Go in as tight as you can.

265
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,800
Now, pull that image and print it.

266
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,000
All right.

267
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,500
Yeah. Thank you.
That's...

268
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,100
My money. Me won, yo.

269
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,400
You's going to get hurt, bumbaclot!

270
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,100
- Where's the leg?
- You don't know who you's messing with.

271
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,500
He knows who he's messing with.
Maybe you didn't hear him.

272
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,500
Where's the leg, man?

273
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,800
- I pawned it.
- Where?

274
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,200
I don't know. I went to a few places...

275
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,100
down by where they got the slide show
on the ceiling.

276
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,700
- Which pawnshop?
- I can't recall a name, man.

277
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,700
I's drunk as a church mouse.

278
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,900
Yeah, I can believe that. Go on.

279
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,000
Anyway...

280
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,700
Find the pawnshops, if there are any...

281
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,300
that sell fake legs.

282
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,400
Sorry about that.

283
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Wait. Do that after we talk to Riggs.

284
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,800
I know what this is about.

285
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,900
- We have your medical records.
- The real ones.

286
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,800
Look, I ain't gonna lie.

287
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,100
I've been through
some trials and tribulations.

288
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,300
But this kid Saturday?

289
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,700
I mean... Jab. Jab.

290
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,500
Straight. Jab, jab. Uppercut!

291
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,300
I'm gonna put on
one hell of a show for the Montecito.

292
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,100
I mean, he's gonna be backing up
so much, he'll think he's a garbage truck.

293
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Look, champ, I remember...

294
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,500
when I used to come watch you spar
all the time, down at the Bristol, right?

295
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,900
Man, I'm telling you.
You were pound for pound...

296
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
one of the best heavyweights I ever saw.

297
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,600
You were something.

298
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,700
So I just don't understand.

299
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,900
Why would you want to go out like this?

300
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,300
We'll say you pulled a rib muscle.
That's why you had to withdraw.

301
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
If the press says anything...
Press?

302
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,300
You think the press care about me?

303
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,700
They're gonna care.
They're gonna care a lot if you take a dive.

304
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,900
Listen.

305
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,400
You know, a while back...

306
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,600
a couple of times...

307
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,700
I did things the easy way
instead of the right way.

308
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,200
And it almost...

309
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,600
What I'm saying is, believe me...

310
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,300
whatever they're paying you, it ain't enough.

311
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,300
If you step in that ring, you could die.
One punch could kill you.

312
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,900
If I don't step in that ring, I will die.

313
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,900
Please.

314
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,200
Don't make me withdraw.

315
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,700
You owe someone?

316
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,200
Yeah?

317
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,500
Hold on.

318
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,600
You're not fighting. That's that.

319
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,700
Sorry.

320
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,900
I should be Round 1.

321
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,400
No, the numbers are only temporary.

322
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,700
I just want to see
how you walk with the cards.

323
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,900
Any luck with that extra ticket I need?

324
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,900
- It's first on my list, Sam.
- Thanks. I'll check with you later.

325
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,300
- Okay.
- Okay.

326
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,200
Well, Mr. Harimoto, how are you?

327
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,800
Hello, Sam. That girl over there.

328
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,700
Number 2? Hot.

329
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,900
She is exquisite.
Yes.

330
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,100
- Can you introduce me?
- Yes.

331
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,800
I can bring her
to the VIP casino for you.

332
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
- Mr. Harimoto, how are you?
- Danny.

333
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,700
Okay. Thank you so much, ladies.
We'll be in touch.

334
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,500
- What's your favourite number?
- Twenty-one.

335
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,800
Hi, does your friend still own
that pawnshop downtown?

336
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,100
You finally gonna splurge and get me
that ankle bracelet I've wanted?

337
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,300
I just need to know
where a guy would go to pawn a fake leg.

338
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
What?
Yeah. He...

339
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,700
- What?
- I didn't say a word.

340
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,000
Yo.

341
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,800
They took away my room
because I ain't fighting.

342
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,800
That's too bad.

343
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,000
Want a ride home?

344
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,300
Home?

345
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,600
You live in Vegas, right?

346
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,000
- No. Not no more.
- Big Riggs.

347
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,500
Ed, I've had six golf balls come bouncing
through the valet area.

348
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,500
Either someone's got a terrible slice...

349
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,100
or they turned the west veranda
into a driving range.

350
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
- I'll check the tapes.
- All right. Hey.

351
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,300
- What's going on, champ?
- I ain't the champ no more.

352
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,100
Give us a second, okay?

353
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,400
Okay.

354
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You know...

355
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,600
in 1995, I had $22 million.

356
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,200
I was the object of desire
for women everywhere.

357
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,500
Now I ain't got a nickel to my name.

358
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,600
Two kids to boot.

359
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,000
You know...

360
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,300
if I can't box no more,
I mean, they're better off with me dead.

361
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,100
Why are you talking crap like that?

362
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,900
I mean, what... What can I do if I can't box?

363
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,600
I mean, man, look,
all I got is these two hands. That's it!

364
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Listen, I understand. Listen.
Do me a favour. Have a steak.

365
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,800
Hey, Joe!

366
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,600
Have a steak on me. I'll be back.
Have a steak.

367
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,600
A big one. Come on.

368
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,600
Sam, get up here now, okay?

369
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,200
I really feel bad for this guy, you know?

370
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,300
He's got no skills, no money...

371
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,600
Hey. That's my good pen.

372
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,100
Here.

373
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,900
The guy's got nowhere to go.

374
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,700
Well, it's not like we have a choice.

375
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,700
If we left him on the card,
the Boxing Commission...

376
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,400
It's just something about this guy
breaks my heart. You know?

377
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,700
Yeah.

378
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,100
Maybe you can talk to your dad?

379
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,900
Yeah, I mean, are you sure
an ex-champ is gonna want to dig ditches?

380
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,200
It's an honest job.

381
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,100
Hi. What's up?

382
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,200
- I need a room.
- It's a fight weekend. We're all comped out.

383
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,900
- Forget the comp. I'll pay for it.
- We've got one garden suite available.

384
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,100
All right. I need it for...

385
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,300
- three or four nights.
- It's $1,200 a night.

386
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,400
- What's that?
- With your discount, it's $300.

387
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,500
I'll take it for a week then.
You got it.

388
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,800
Hey, will you scratch my foot?
Bye-bye.

389
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Just right down underneath the...

390
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,900
About here?
Yeah.

391
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,300
Yeah, he's still at the Montecito.

392
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,500
You're damn right, he'll go for it.

393
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,700
I got your room situation straightened out.

394
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,400
Upgraded you to a suite.

395
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,600
So, them telling me I had to leave...

396
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,800
That was a big mistake.
All right.

397
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,500
Are you ready?
Yeah.

398
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah, the way I see it,
he don't have a choice.

399
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,100
Unless he wants to end up dead.

400
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,900
Hey, Justin. How are you?

401
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,900
I talked to Charlie. All set.
Concrete'll be here Wednesday.

402
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,300
That'll help.

403
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,900
Listen, I wanted to ask you...

404
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
remember I said Riggs was fighting
on the under card tomorrow?

405
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,600
Well, he needs a job.

406
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,700
- What, here?
- Yeah.

407
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,500
What does an ex-champ want
with construction work?

408
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,000
He's broke, and he doesn't have any skills.

409
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,400
Why should I hire him?

410
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,200
I could teach him to operate the backhoe.

411
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,900
With all your spare time.

412
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
Look, he's a good man.

413
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,000
Well, so long as he knows
what he's getting himself into.

414
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,300
Make sure he's here
tomorrow morning, bright and early.

415
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,600
You want to go grab a beer later?

416
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,100
I'd love to, but I'm really... I'm really busy.

417
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,300
You've been busy a lot since Mom died.

418
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Eventually, you and I are going to go out,
whether you like it or not.

419
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,500
You can make $60 an hour operating
heavy equipment. I could teach you.

420
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,500
I appreciate
what you're doing, Danny.

421
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,700
It's just that all that money I made...

422
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,700
manager fees, lawyer fees, promoters,
relatives I didn't even know I got.

423
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,300
My money's gone...

424
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,700
and the friends and relatives
who thought I was so nice are gone, too.

425
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,100
Man, I thought I'd be retired
right about now, you know?

426
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,400
Walking my kids to school.
Fishing somewhere.

427
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,900
Spending time with my wife, man.

428
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,500
Not learning to operate heavy equipment.

429
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,900
Hold on here a second.

430
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,800
I'm Danny McCoy.
I work for the Montecito.

431
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,700
I noticed you had a nice little run going here.

432
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,900
Could I get you a buffet comp?

433
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Thanks, no. I just stopped by
to say hi to a friend of mine.

434
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,300
- Well, maybe I could help you find him.
- I'll find him.

435
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,800
Okay.

436
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,000
- You know this guy?
- What guy?

437
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,500
Hi.
Hi.

438
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,500
Mary, do you know Mr. Harimoto?

439
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,500
- Hello.
- He gave me this.

440
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,700
Very nice.

441
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,800
We're dating.

442
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,100
Well, I'm sure he's gonna
just love your round-card girl outfit.

443
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,000
- Is he going to the fight?
- Actually, he is.

444
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,300
But he wants me to sit with him.
He wants me to stay with him all weekend...

445
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,400
- so I'm not gonna be able to do this.
- You're backing out?

446
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,500
- Eighteen hours before the fight?
- Round-card girl pays $200.

447
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,800
Mr. Harimoto is really generous.

448
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,300
Anyway, aren't there
like a million hot girls in Vegas?

449
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,000
No. George Maloof is giving
a lingerie party tomorrow...

450
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,900
which severely limits availability,
and there's a Brad Pitt movie shooting.

451
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,800
- Everybody wants to be an extra.
- A Brad Pitt movie?

452
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,800
The point is, I don't have time
to hold more auditions...

453
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,700
and you agreed to do this.

454
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,800
Sorry.

455
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,500
You realise you will not work for me again?

456
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,000
Oh, boo-hoo.

457
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,800
Back up, you told Delinda,
my ex-girlfriend...

458
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,500
that you wanted to take her
to a deserted island and burn her clothes?

459
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,400
I'm sorry. You should've been there.

460
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,700
I'm lucky I got out with my life,
much less the $75,000.

461
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,200
- You want my opinion?
- Yes.

462
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,000
You gotta turn it in, man.

463
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,000
That's what I keep telling them.

464
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,800
- But those girls...
- It's just busting you up, isn't it?

465
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,400
Hey, I didn't sleep all night. Seriously.

466
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,800
I believe you. So, there's no ID in the bag?

467
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,900
No.

468
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,100
Yeah? All right. I'll be right up.

469
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,900
It's Ed. Want me to get this fingerprinted?

470
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,100
Yeah. That's a great idea, Danny.

471
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,100
Thanks, Danny. Thanks a lot.

472
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,500
You're welcome.

473
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,500
Hey, Heath. Take this over
to Det. Perez and have him fingerprint it.

474
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,400
Okay.
Thanks.

475
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,500
Mosley tells me he's still got
a one-legged cut man.

476
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,400
I got the names of a few pawnshops.

477
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,700
I'm headed out with Vince
to look for the missing limb.

478
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,600
I... How's everything with your dad?

479
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,300
- It's the normal father-son stuff.
- Normal?

480
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,600
I haven't got a son.

481
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,800
It's like what you go through
with Delinda, only fewer words.

482
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,100
Hey...

483
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,600
Here, take your old man to the fight.
Have some fun with him.

484
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,500
Wow, Ed.

485
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,500
I'd love to, but I'm working the fight.

486
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,000
I'll make an arrangement.

487
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,200
Family takes care of family.

488
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,800
Thank you.

489
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Tell your dad
thanks a lot for taking care of Riggs.

490
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,100
I will.

491
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,700
And, Danny, thank you, too.

492
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,300
Yeah, we're looking for prosthetic legs.

493
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,800
- When are they cutting yours off?
- Tuesday.

494
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,600
I got a bin over there.

495
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,100
Big business.

496
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,700
No. Mine's graphite. Took months to make.

497
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,800
All right. Don't get discouraged.
We'll find it.

498
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,000
I'm Irish.

499
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,600
Hey. Look, nothing's changed
with the tickets, and I'm very busy.

500
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,100
It's not the ticket. Donald Trump
doesn't want to sit behind Steve Wynn.

501
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,300
Thought you'd want to know.
Great. Another seating chart.

502
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,600
Just arranging the rappers is a full-time job.

503
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,900
Now I've got to find a new round-card girl.

504
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,400
You will be able to get the extra ticket?

505
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Would you like to be the round-card girl
at the Barimba-Mosley fight? Pays $200.

506
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Never mind. Get the hell out of here,
before I call security.

507
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,400
Beverage. Down. Go, go.

508
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,600
How old do you think she was?
16? 15?

509
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,800
Sam!
Mr. Herman!

510
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,200
- You got those tickets yet?
- Of course I do. Who's your daddy?

511
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,200
I'll do it.

512
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,700
- Do what?
- I'll be your round-card girl.

513
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,700
Yes, but I want reciprocity. Mary.

514
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,700
I need the ticket.

515
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,400
Well, lucky for you...

516
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,800
Mr. Culpepper died
in the steam room last night.

517
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,900
Oh! But Mr. Culpepper...

518
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,800
Yeah. Don't get too upset. He died happy.

519
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,300
You're gonna put on a bikini
and parade around in front of 20,000 people?

520
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Deal.
Yeah, deal.

521
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,000
What's this?

522
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Fight tickets, for us.

523
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,300
- The Mosley fight?
- Yeah. Good seats. Can you go?

524
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,600
Remember the first fight we went to?

525
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,700
It was for your 10th birthday.
Your mom bought us the tickets.

526
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,500
- It was a good birthday.
- What time's it start?

527
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,200
Can you just forget about work
for one night? Come on. It'll be fun.

528
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,600
- First beer's on me. 7:00. You can make it.
- I'll try and make it.

529
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,900
No "I'll try to make it." You'll make it.

530
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,200
You sound just like your mother,
you know?

531
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,500
Even have that same goofy grin.

532
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,600
- Can you make it to the fight or not?
- I said I'd try and make it.

533
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,500
Tell me something.

534
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,600
When does Coleman Riggs plan on
starting his new job?

535
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,300
- He didn't show up today?
- No.

536
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,800
What the hell happened?

537
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,500
He was hit by a golf ball
from the employee parking lot.

538
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,200
- Golf ball?
- Golf ball.

539
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,000
Get me the tapes from the employee
parking lot in the last 10 minutes.

540
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,000
Christie, it's Danny. Connect me
with Coleman Riggs' suite, please.

541
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,300
Hey, Mikey.
Did they find any prints?

542
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,500
No. No prints. Just some blue stuff.

543
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,700
- Blue stuff?
- A blue substance.

544
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,500
Fortunately for everyone,
they were able to trace it, so...

545
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,800
See you later.

546
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,900
What a nice bunch
of well-behaved young men.

547
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,200
You tell Barimba that the fight,
and his paycheque...

548
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,600
are in serious jeopardy unless
that leg makes a quick appearance.

549
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,500
Will do. Heath.

550
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,500
Could I get overnights
on Camera 3612, Building 2?

551
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,400
Put it on Monitor 51.

552
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,700
All right. Freeze on the little guy.

553
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,800
Who is that?
I'm trying to figure that out.

554
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,700
This was recorded last night.
Get me a facial recognition, please.

555
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,800
Blow it up a field over here.

556
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,000
Leonard Devito. A frigging popcorn operator.

557
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,300
Half a wise guy.

558
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,700
If Riggs is hanging with this guy,
he's got to be in trouble.

559
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,400
Well, it ain't right.

560
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,200
Okay, here they are.
They're headed for the elevator. Let's go.

561
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,600
Ed. Wait up.

562
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,800
Hey. You going somewhere?

563
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,400
You know, this guy's a world-class athlete.

564
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,400
You two are asking Secretariat
to plough a field.

565
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,700
What are you doing?

566
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,300
He's going to Biloxi
so he can make a decent living.

567
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,500
You think this guy cares if you
kill yourself taking a punch?

568
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,900
- You watch too many movies.
- Is this how you want to be remembered?

569
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,200
Fighting some in some tin can?
Biloxi, Mississippi?

570
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,700
No one ever questioned your heart, man.
It made you a champ. What are you doing?

571
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,600
Only value I got is who I used to be.

572
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,900
He forgets
where he lives sometimes.

573
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,300
Doesn't remember his kids' names.
He's hip-deep in medical bills.

574
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,700
- Biloxi's gonna get him on his feet.
- Don't do it. Come on.

575
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,300
You used to work construction
for your dad, right?

576
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,100
- Yeah.
- I mean, if it's such a great job...

577
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,300
how come you ain't doing it?

578
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,700
Yeah. That's just what I thought.

579
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,500
Come on. Get out of here.

580
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,500
Hey, guys.

581
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,100
I think we have something of yours.

582
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,700
Let me just say, it's a pleasure meeting you.

583
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,800
Yeah, we really love the show.

584
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,900
I'm guessing they stay in character?

585
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,400
Method actors. That's cool.

586
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,300
Anyway, here's the money.

587
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,300
Yeah, you can count it or not.

588
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,900
It's all there. Seventy-five...
Thousand...

589
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,100
Dollars.

590
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,100
That's real money! Guys!

591
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,700
My blue brothers, this is madness.

592
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
How could you do this?

593
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,500
What are you doing? That's real money.

594
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,000
You're right, Mike.
This is a lot better than going to Tahiti.

595
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,300
I didn't want those Mikimotos, anyway.

596
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,300
Soon they'll start tearing the seats apart.

597
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,500
Barimba's camp claims they don't know
where the leg is.

598
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,500
All right. Look, I'm through talking.

599
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,300
Why don't you grab them all and bring them
to that green room by the arena?

600
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,400
Yes. It's going down like James Brown.

601
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,500
Good evening, gentlemen.

602
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,300
As I'm sure you know...

603
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,000
your fighter is waiting in the ring
for this fight to commence.

604
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,500
However, this fight will not start...

605
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,800
until Mr. Shane Mosley enters the arena.

606
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,900
Now, he refuses to do so...

607
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,900
until his cut man has his leg back.

608
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,900
Now. I know who took it.

609
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,200
I know who was hitting golf balls with it.

610
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,900
Now you listen while I talk.

611
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,900
If there's no leg, there's no fight.

612
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,400
Except for one
that's gonna happen in this room.

613
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,100
Me and Danny here, we're gonna
go back to our office for 10 minutes.

614
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,400
But in 10 minutes, if I come back here...

615
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,300
and there's not a leg
in the middle of this table...

616
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,400
I'm gonna bitch-slap every one
of you so hard...

617
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,800
that your unborn children
will come out well-behaved.

618
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,100
- Now, am I clear?
- Yeah, man.

619
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,400
Let's go.

620
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,600
Yeah.

621
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,100
Hey, you're not in costume.
You have to get out there.

622
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,500
I still have to talk
to the T-shirt supplier and the beer vendor.

623
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,000
God. You're sick.

624
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,200
I had lunch with Mr. Harimoto and he
had the oysters overnighted from Japan.

625
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,700
Geez. Okay. It's all right. Come here.

626
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,600
Yeah. False alarm.
False alarms are the worst.

627
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,300
Look, honey. I'm so sorry you're ill.

628
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,000
- But I must get back out there.
- I'll be okay. I'll put the bathing suit on.

629
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,900
Don't worry. I won't take back
your extra ticket.

630
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,900
Thanks, Mary.

631
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,800
How long has it been?
Long enough.

632
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,900
Here, run this...

633
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,300
He's coming.

634
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,100
You loose enough?
Yeah. I'm good to go.

635
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,700
Now making his entrance
into the ring in the red corner...

636
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,600
wearing gold with green...

637
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,400
officially weighing in
at 153 and one half pounds...

638
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,800
the winner of 39 professional bouts...

639
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:28,600
including 35 knockouts,
a three-time world champion...

640
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,000
the pride of Pomona, California...

641
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,800
the reigning and defending...

642
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,600
Super Welterweight Champion of the World...

643
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,300
Sugar Shane...

644
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,300
Mosley!

645
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,000
Touch them up! Let's go!

646
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,700
Mosley's had trouble
with his left hand.

647
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,000
I wonder if it'll affect his performance.

648
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,500
We'll soon see, Bob.

649
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,100
Absolutely.

650
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,100
And there's the bell.
Both fighters right into the centre of the ring.

651
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,400
Going at it pretty hard. Mosley circling left.

652
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,600
Dad!

653
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,200
The left hand looks good.

654
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,900
Mosley's almost smiling.
Barimba's coming right back, though.

655
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,000
Sharp jab
followed by a cross.

656
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,600
Barimba takes a solid right cross to the jaw.

657
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,800
Barimba's struggling
now, trying to get up.

658
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,900
He's up now. Donnelly's giving him
a standing eight count.

659
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,700
You all right? You want to continue?

660
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,100
He's backing Barimba up.

661
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,900
He's holding!
There's Donnelly with the separation.

662
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,200
There's the bell!

663
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,500
You look great!

664
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,400
Where you been? Getting worried, man.

665
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,400
I forgot how bad
the traffic was on Fight Night.

666
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,800
- So, how's it going?
- Good.

667
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,900
That was a very professional job
you did back there.

668
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,700
I'm serious.

669
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,500
Hold it. What the hell's that?

670
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,900
That... That would be a Blue Man.

671
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,600
And he brought his brother with him.

672
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,700
What's that, his cousin?

673
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,200
Get rid of the blue guys.

674
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,300
- That was fun.
- Mosley looked great, didn't he?

675
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,100
Mr. Herman? What's the problem?

676
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,300
My wife. She ran off with Lisa.
Her weekend friend.

677
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,200
Not starting from the basement,
but he has a lot of expectations, doesn't he?

678
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,500
Yes, Bob. Bojado has a lot to prove to the
boxing public. When he was coming up...

679
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,700
- he was labelled the next Oscar de la Hoya...
- Do you have money on another fight?

680
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,800
No, a friend does.

681
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,000
Danny, we gotta do this more often.
What'd I tell you?

682
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,500
Huh?
Yep.

683
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,000
Your dad like the fight?
Yeah.

684
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,100
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

685
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,700
You know,
Riggs took a dive in Biloxi.

686
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,900
The results are posted downstairs.

687
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,900
- Well, that's good.
- Why is that good?

688
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,800
He's alive.
