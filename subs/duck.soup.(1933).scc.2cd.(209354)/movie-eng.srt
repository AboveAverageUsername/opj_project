00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,600
MRS. TEASDALE, I ASK YOU TO RECONSIDER.
YES, YOUR EXCELLENCY?

3
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,700
I'VE LOANED FREEDONIA
MORE THAN HALF THE FORTUNE MY HUSBAND LEFT ME.

4
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,200
I CONSIDER THAT MONEY LOST.
NOW YOU'RE ASKING FOR ANOTHER $20 MILLION.

5
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,600
IT WOULD ONLY BE
FOR A FEW MONTHS.

6
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,300
WITH $20 MILLION
IN THE TREASURY,

7
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,600
WE CAN ANNOUNCE A
REDUCTION IN TAXES.

8
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,300
I'M SORRY,
BUT I'M INCLINED TO AGREE WITH THE PEOPLE.

9
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,900
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MISMANAGED.
WHAT?

10
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,300
I WILL LEND THE MONEY
ON CONDITION THAT HIS EXCELLENCY WITHDRAW...

11
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,100
AND PLACE THE GOVERNMENT
IN NEW HANDS.

12
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,300
YOU ASK ME TO GIVE UP MY OFFICE?
YES, YOUR EXCELLENCY.

13
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,500
FREEDONIA NEEDS
A NEW LEADER,

14
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,500
A PROGRESSIVE,
FEARLESS FIGHTER.

15
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,600
A MAN LIKE RUFUS T. FIREFLY.
RUFUS T. FIREFLY?

16
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,200
I WILL LEND THE MONEY
ONLY IF FIREFLY IS APPOINTED LEADER.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,100
THE HONORABLE SECRETARY
OF FINANCE AND PARTY.

18
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,200
HIS EXCELLENCY, AMBASSADOR
TRENTINO OF SYLVANIA.

19
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,600
AMBASSADOR.
MRS. TEASDALE.

20
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,000
IT WAS SO GOOD
OF YOU TO COME.

21
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,700
I'M ANXIOUS FOR YOU
TO MEET THE NEW LEADER OF OUR COUNTRY.

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,500
NO MATTER WHO RULES,
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE THE FIRST LADY OF THE LAND.

23
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,000
OH, PERMIT ME.
MISS VERA MARCAL.

24
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,200
AMBASSADOR TRENTINO.
MISS MARCAL NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION.

25
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
I'VE SEEN HER DANCE MANY TIMES.
THANK YOU.

26
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,300
THE HONORABLE
PANDOOH OF MIFHTAN.

27
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,700
I MUST GREET
HIS HONOR.

28
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,900
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND OUT?
I'VE BEEN WAITING TO HEAR FROM YOU.

29
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,100
I'VE GIVEN UP THE IDEA
OF A REVOLUTION. I HAVE A BETTER PLAN.

30
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,500
I CAN GAIN CONTROL
OF FREEDONIA EASIER BY MARRYING MRS. TEASDALE.

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,800
MAYBE THAT'S NOT GOING
TO BE SO EASY.

32
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,200
FROM WHAT I HEAR,
MRS. TEASDALE IS SWEET ON THIS RUFUS T. FIREFLY.

33
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,100
THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.
I'M GOING TO PLACE HIM IN YOUR HANDS.

34
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,600
AND I DON'T HAVE TO TELL
YOU WHAT TO -- CAREFUL.

35
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,100
I WANT YOU TO MEET HIS
EXCELLENCY'S SECRETARY.

36
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,300
BOB ROLAND. AMBASSADOR TRENTINO.
HOW DO YOU DO, SIR?

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,600
MISS MARCAL.
WE'VE MET.

38
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,300
I HOPE HIS EXCELLENCY
GETS HERE SOON.

39
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,300
HIS EXCELLENCY
MAKES IT A POINT ALWAYS TO BE ON TIME.

40
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,000
AS LONG AS I'VE KNOWN HIM,
HE'S NEVER BEEN LATE.

41
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,700
HIS EXCELLENCY IS DUE
TO TAKE HIS STATION

42
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
BEGINNING HIS
NEW ADMINISTRATION

43
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,100
HE'LL MAKE HIS APPEARANCE
WHEN

44
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,900
THE CLOCK ON THE WALL
STRIKES TEN

45
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,800

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,400

NEW ADMINISTRATION

51
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,700
HE'LL MAKE HIS APPEARANCE

53
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,900
WE'LL GIVE HIM

54
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,900
TO SHOW HIM
WE'RE GLAD HE'S HERE

55
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,300
HAIL, HAIL FREEDONIA

56
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,300
HAIL, HAIL FREEDONIA

57
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,200
LAND OF THE BRAVE

58
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,800

59
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,400
HAIL, HAIL FREEDONIA

60
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,900

63
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,700
YOU EXPECTING SOMEBODY?
YES.

64
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,400
HAIL, HAIL FREEDONIA

65
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,800
LAND OF THE BRAVE

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
OH, YOUR EXCELLENCY,
WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

67
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,900
AS CHAIRWOMAN
OF THE RECEPTION,

68
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,400
I EXTEND THE GOOD WISHES OF
EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD OF FREEDONIA.

69
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,300
NEVER MIND THAT.
TAKE A CARD.

70
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,700
CARD? WHAT'LL I DO WITH A CARD?
KEEP IT. I'VE GOT 51 LEFT.

71
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,000
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?
AS CHAIRWOMAN,

72
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,300
I WELCOME YOU WITH OPEN ARMS.
IS THAT SO? HOW LATE DO YOU STAY OPEN?

73
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,900
I'VE SPONSORED YOUR
APPOINTMENT BECAUSE I FEEL YOU ARE...

74
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,700
THE MOST ABLE STATESMAN IN ALL FREEDONIA.
THAT COVERS A LOT OF GROUND.

75
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,600
YOU COVER A LOT
OF GROUND YOURSELF. YOU BETTER BEAT IT.

76
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,000
I HEAR THEY'RE GONNA
TEAR YOU DOWN AND PUT UP AN OFFICE BUILDING.

77
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,100
YOU CAN LEAVE IN A TAXI.
IF YOU CAN'T GET A TAXI, YOU CAN LEAVE IN A HUFF.

78
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,000
IF THAT'S TOO SOON, YOU CAN
LEAVE IN A MINUTE AND A HUFF.

79
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,100
YOU HAVEN'T STOPPED TALKING
SINCE I CAME.

80
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,300
THE FUTURE OF FREEDONIA
RESTS ON YOU.

81
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,500
PROMISE ME YOU'LL
FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF MY HUSBAND.

82
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,400
I HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE JOB
FIVE MINUTES AND ALREADY SHE'S MAKING ADVANCES TO ME.

83
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,600
WHERE IS YOUR HUSBAND?
WHY... HE'S DEAD.

84
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,400
I'LL BET HE'S USING THAT
AS AN EXCUSE.

85
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,700
I WAS WITH HIM 'TIL THE VERY END.
NO WONDER HE PASSED AWAY.

86
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,600
I HELD HIM IN MY ARMS
AND KISSED HIM.

87
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,600
I SEE.
THEN IT WAS MURDER!

88
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,100
WILL YOU MARRY ME?
DID HE LEAVE YOU MONEY? ANSWER THE SECOND FIRST.

89
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
HE LEFT ME HIS ENTIRE FORTUNE.
IS THAT SO?

90
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,800
CAN'T YOU SEE I'M
TRYING TO TELL YOU I LOVE YOU!

91
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,500
OH, YOUR EXCELLENCY!
YOU'RE NOT SO BAD YOURSELF.

92
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,100
I WANT TO PRESENT YOU
AMBASSADOR TRENTINO OF SYLVANIA.

93
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,200
HAVING HIM WITH US IS
INDEED A GREAT PLEASURE.

94
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,600
THANK YOU, BUT I CAN'T STAY VERY LONG.
THAT'S A GREATER PLEASURE.

95
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,100
HOW 'BOUT LENDING THIS
COUNTRY $20 MILLION, YOU OLD SKINFLINT?

96
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,400
$20 MILLION IS A LOT OF MONEY.
I HAVE TO TAKE THAT UP WITH MY MINISTER OF FINANCE.

97
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,300
COULD YOU LET ME HAVE $12 UNTIL PAYDAY?
$12?

98
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,000
YOU'LL GET IT BACK.
I'LL GIVE YOU MY NOTE FOR 90 DAYS.

99
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,000
IF IT ISN'T PAID BY THEN,
KEEP THE NOTE.

100
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,300
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
HAVEN'T WE SEEN EACH OTHER SOMEWHERE BEFORE?

101
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,600
I'M NOT SURE
I'M SEEING YOU NOW. MUST BE SOMETHING I ATE.

102
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,000
LOOK HERE! ARE YOU TRYING TO --
DON'T LOOK NOW,

103
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,700
BUT THERE'S ONE MAN
TOO MANY IN THIS ROOM AND I THINK IT'S YOU.

104
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,600
I'M SO SORRY.

105
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,800
I WANT YOU TO MEET A VERY CHARMING LADY.
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

106
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,600
JUST A MOMENT.
I WANT TO PRESENT MISS VERA MARCAL.

107
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,800
GO AHEAD. I CAN TAKE IT.
OH, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

108
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,900
THIS IS VERA MARCAL, THE FAMOUS DANCER.
IS THAT SO?

109
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,400
CAN YOU DO THIS ONE?

110
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,200
I DANCED BEFORE
NAPOLEON.

111
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,800
NO, NAPOLEON DANCED
BEFORE ME. HE DANCED 200 YEARS BEFORE ME.

112
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,400
HERE'S ONE I PICKED UP
IN A DANCE HALL.

113
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,900
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE I
PICKED UP IN A DANCE HALL.

114
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,800
PERHAPS SOMETIME WE GET
A CHANCE TO DANCE TOGETHER?

115
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,000
I COULD DANCE WITH YOU
'TIL THE COWS COME HOME.

116
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,100
I'D RATHER DANCE WITH
THE COWS 'TIL YOU COME HOME.

117
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,000
WHERE IS MY SECRETARY?
HERE I AM.

118
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,100
GOOD HEAVENS!

119
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,000
TAKE A LETTER. MY DENTIST.
WHO TO?

120
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,900
"DEAR DENTIST, ENCLOSED
FIND CHECK FOR $500." SEND IT OFF IMMEDIATELY.

121
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,700
I'LL HAVE TO ENCLOSE THE CHECK FIRST.
YOU DO AND I'LL FIRE YOU.

122
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,800
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
THE EYES OF THE WORLD ARE UPON YOU.

123
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,000
NOTABLES FROM EVERY COUNTRY
ARE GATHERED IN YOUR HONOR.

124
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,300
THIS IS A GALA DAY
FOR YOU.

125
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,700
A GAL A DAY IS ENOUGH
FOR ME. I DON'T THINK I COULD HANDLE ANY MORE.

126
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,000
IF IT'S NOT
ASKING TOO MUCH...

127
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,500
FOR OUR INFORMATION
JUST FOR ILLUSTRATION

128
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,300

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,700
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,900
HAIL, HAIL FREEDONIA

134
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,000
IF CHEWING GUM IS CHEWED
THE CHEWER IS PURSUED

135
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,600
AND IN THE HOOSEGOW
HIDDEN

136
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,700
IF WE CHOOSE TO CHEW
WE'LL BE PURSUED

137
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,700
IF ANY FORM OF PLEASURE
IS EXHIBITED

138
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,800
REPORT TO ME AND
IT WILL BE PROHIBITED

139
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,500
I'LL PUT MY FOOT DOWN
SO SHALL IT BE

140
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
THIS IS THE LAND
OF THE FREE

141
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,500
THE LAST MAN NEARLY RUINED
THIS PLACE, HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT

142
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,400
IF YOU THINK THIS COUNTRY'S
BAD OFF NOW JUST WAIT 'TIL I GET THROUGH WITH IT

143
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,300
THE COUNTRY'S TAXES
MUST BE FIXED AND I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT

144
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,100
IF YOU THINK YOU'RE PAYING
TOO MUCH NOW JUST WAIT 'TIL I GET THROUGH WITH IT

145
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,400
I WILL NOT STAND FOR ANYTHING
THAT'S CROOKED OR UNFAIR

146
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,800
I'M STRICTLY ON THE UP AND UP
SO EVERYONE BEWARE

147
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,900
IF ANYONE'S CAUGHT
TAKING GRAFT AND I DON'T GET MY SHARE

148
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,200
WE STAND 'EM UP
AGAINST THE WALL AND POP GOES THE WEASEL

149
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,500
SO EVERYONE BEWARE
WHO'S CROOKED OR UNFAIR

150
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,700
NO ONE MUST TAKE
A BIT OF GRAFT UNLESS HE GETS HIS SHARE

151
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,200
IF ANY MAN SHOULD COME BETWEEN
A HUSBAND AND HIS BRIDE

152
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,000
WE FIND OUT
WHICH ONE SHE PREFERS BY LETTING HER DECIDE

153
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,100
IF SHE PREFERS THE OTHER MAN
THE HUSBAND STEPS OUTSIDE

154
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,200
WE STAND THEM UP
AGAINST THE WALL AND POP GOES THE WEASEL

155
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,100
THE HUSBAND STEPS OUTSIDE RELINQUISHES HIS BRIDE
AAAA

156
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,200
THEY STAND HIM UP AGAINST THE
WALL AND TAKE AWAY HIS BRIDE

157
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,500
YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
AT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

158
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,900
GOOD HEAVENS!
YOU CAN'T GO WITH YOUR TROUSERS UP!

159
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,000
I CAN'T, EH?
THEY'LL NEVER CATCH ME ANY OTHER WAY.

160
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,500
MY CAR!
HIS EXCELLENCY'S CAR!

161
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,100
- HIS EXCELLENCY'S CAR.

162
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
- HIS EXCELLENCY'S CAR.

163
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,900
I'M IN A HURRY.
IF YOU RUN OUT OF GAS, GET ETHYL.

164
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
IF ETHYL RUNS OUT, GET MABEL.
NOW STEP ON IT.

165
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,900
IT CERTAINLY FEELS GOOD
TO BE BACK AGAIN.

166
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,200
I HAVE FAILED, AMBASSADOR.
I KNOW IT, YOU IDIOT!

167
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,700
I'M SORRY.
YOU HAVE MUDDLED EVERYTHING.

168
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
IF YOU'D STARTED THE REVOLUTION
AS I PLANNED...

169
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,600
I COULD'VE STEPPED IN
AND PLACED FREEDONIA UNDER THE SYLVANIAN FLAG.

170
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,800
BUT FIREFLY BLOCKED US!

171
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,300
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW POPULAR HE IS.
I'VE KNOWN OF THAT TOO.

172
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TWO SPIES
SHADOWING HIM.

173
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
I WANT TO FIND OUT SOMETHING
TO DISGRACE HIM.

174
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
TO DISCREDIT HIM
WITH THE PEOPLE.

175
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,700
AMBASSADOR, CHICOLINI
AND PINKY ARE HERE.

176
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,500
THESE ARE MY SPIES.
SHOW THEM IN. WAIT OUTSIDE.

177
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,600
WE FOOL YOU GOOD,
EH?

178
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,000
GENTLEMEN!

179
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,300
GENTLEMEN,
WHAT IS THIS?

180
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,900
SHH! THIS IS SPY STUFF.

181
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,900
TELEGRAM FOR YOU, SIR.
OH.

182
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,700
HE GETS MAD BECAUSE HE CAN'T READ.
OH, I SEE.

183
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,700
GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE
SERIOUS MATTERS TO DISCUSS.

184
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,000
PLEASE BE SEATED.
ROCK-A-BYE

185
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,300
GENTLEMEN, ABOUT
THAT INFORMATION --

186
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,500
WAIT, HERE, HAVE A CIGAR.
THAT'S A GOOD QUARTER CIGAR.

187
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,200
I SMOKED THE OTHER THREE QUARTERS MYSELF.
NO, THANK YOU.

188
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,700
HERE, TRY
ONE OF THESE.

189
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,300
HERE,
THAT'S-A NO GOOD.

190
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,400
THAT'S-A GOOD!
THAT'S-A FINE.

191
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,800
THAT'S-A GOOD.

192
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,900
LET'S CONCENTRATE.

193
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,300
HAVE YOU BEEN
TRAILING FIREFLY?

194
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,900
HA-HA!
HAVE WE BEEN TRAILING FIREFLY!

195
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,200
MY PARTNER HERE'S GOT A NOSE JUST LIKE A BLOODHOUND.
REALLY?

196
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,500
AND THE REST OF HIS FACE
DON'T LOOK SO GOOD EITHER.

197
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,100
WE FIND OUT ALL ABOUT
THIS FIREFLY.

198
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,100
LOOK AT THIS.
AH, VERY GOOD!

199
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,400
WAIT. WE MUST NOT
BE DISTURBED.

200
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,800
YES, SIR?
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONFERENCE.

201
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
I DO NOT WISH TO BE INTERRUPTED.
YES, SIR.

202
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,400
UH-UH, UH-UH!

203
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,300
GENTLEMEN, WE ARE NOT
GETTING ANYWHERE.

204
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,200
YOU'RE OUT!

205
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,500
AH-AH-AH-AH-AH!
GENTLEMEN, PLEASE!

206
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,800
WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU
FOUND OUT ABOUT FIREFLY?

207
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,500
REMEMBER YOU GAVE US A PICTURE AND SAID "FOLLOW HIM"?
OH YES.

208
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,200
WE GET ON THE JOB
RIGHT AWAY.

209
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
IN ONE HOUR, LESS THAN ONE HOUR,
YES?

210
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,600
WE LOSE-A THE PICTCH.
THAT'S-A PRETTY QUICK WORK.

211
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,300
I ASKED YOU TO DIG UP
SOMETHING I CAN USE AGAINST FIREFLY.

212
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,600
DID YOU BRING ME
HIS RECORD?

213
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,700
NO, NO!

214
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,100
AND THE BOY
GETS-A CIGAR.

215
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,500
CHICOLINI, I WANT
A DETAILED REPORT OF YOUR INVESTIGATION.

216
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,700
MONDAY, WE WATCH
FIREFLY'S HOUSE, BUT HE NO COME OUT.

217
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,000
HE WASN'T HOME.

218
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,300
TUESDAY, WE GO TO THE BALL GAME,
BUT HE FOOL US. HE NO SHOW UP.

219
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,700
WEDNESDAY, HE GO TO THE
BALL GAME, BUT WE FOOL HIM! WE NO SHOW UP.

220
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,200
THURSDAY WAS A DOUBLEHEADER,
NOBODY SHOW UP.

221
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,800
FRIDAY, IT RAINED ALL DAY.
THERE WAS NO BALL GAME. WE LISTENED OVER THE RADIO.

222
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,800
YOU DIDN'T SHADOW FIREFLY!
WE SHADOW HIM ALL DAY.

223
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,500
WHAT DAY WAS THAT?
"SHADDERDAY"!

224
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,800
THAT'S-A SOME JOKE,
HUH, BOSS?

225
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,600
WILL YOU TELL ME, WHAT HAPPENED SATURDAY?
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED ME.

226
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,700
WE FOLLOW THIS MAN
TO A ROAD HOUSE.

227
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,100
HE MEET A MARRIED LADY.
A MARRIED LADY?

228
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,300
YEAH, I THINK IT WAS HIS WIFE.
FIREFLY HAS NO WIFE!

229
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,700
NO?
NO!

230
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,000
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
I THINK WE FOLLOWED THE WRONG MAN.

231
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,800
OH, GENTLEMEN,
I AM DISAPPOINTED.

232
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,700
I ENTRUSTED YOU WITH A
MISSION OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AND YOU FAILED.

233
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,100
HOWEVER, I AM GOING TO
GIVE YOU ONE MORE CHANCE.

234
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,200
I HAVE CREDENTIALS
THAT WILL GET YOU INTO ANY PLACE IN FREEDONIA.

235
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,800
IF I CAN ONLY --
AH, HERE WE ARE.

236
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,800
ARE YOU SURE THAT
YOU CAN TRAP FIREFLY?

237
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,400
REMEMBER,
THIS TIME I EXPECT RESULTS.

238
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,200
GOOD-BYE AND GOOD LUCK.
OKAY, CAP.

239
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,500
COME ON, PINKY.
GOOD-BYE.

240
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,900
ALL RIGHT, THE
MEETING'S CALLED TO ORDER.

241
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,700
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
HERE'S THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT'S REPORT.

242
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,900
I HOPE YOU'LL
FIND IT CLEAR.

243
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,300
CLEAR? WHY A
FOUR-YEAR-OLD CHILD COULD UNDERSTAND THIS REPORT.

244
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,200
FIND ME A FOUR-YEAR-OLD
CHILD. I CAN'T MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OUT OF IT.

245
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,800
MEMBERS OF THE CABINET,
WE'LL TAKE UP OLD BUSINESS.

246
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,100
I WISH TO DISCUSS THE TARIFF.
SIT DOWN, THAT'S NEW BUSINESS.

247
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,300
NO OLD BUSINESS?
VERY WELL, WE'LL TAKE UP NEW BUSINESS.

248
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,400
ABOUT THAT TARIFF.
TOO LATE! THAT'S OLD BUSINESS ALREADY.

249
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,700
AS YOUR SECRETARY OF WAR --
OUT OF ORDER!

250
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,300
WHICH REMINDS ME,
SO IS THE PLUMBING. MAKE A NOTE OF THAT.

251
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,600
NEVER MIND,
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

252
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
WISHES TO REPORT...

253
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,600
THAT THE WORKERS OF FREEDONIA
ARE DEMANDING SHORTER HOURS.

254
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,600
WE'LL GIVE THEM SHORTER
HOURS BY CUTTING THEIR LUNCH HOUR TO 20 MINUTES.

255
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,500
GENTLEMEN, WE'VE
GOT TO START LOOKING FOR A NEW TREASURER.

256
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,800
YOU APPOINTED ONE LAST WEEK!
THAT'S THE ONE I'M LOOKING FOR.

257
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,900
GENTLEMEN, ENOUGH.
HOW ABOUT TAKING UP THE TAX?

258
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,800
-HOW ABOUT TAKING UP THE CARPET?
-WE MUST TAKE UP THE TAX!

259
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,300
YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE UP
THE TAX BEFORE YOU CAN TAKE UP THE CARPET.

260
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
I GIVE MY TIME TO MY DUTIES
AND WHAT DO I GET?

261
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,900
- YOU GET AWFULLY TIRESOME.
- SIR, YOU TRY MY PATIENCE.

262
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,700
YOU MUST COME OVER
AND TRY MINE SOME TIME.

263
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,300
THAT'S THE LAST STRAW!
I RESIGN. I WASH MY HANDS OF THE WHOLE BUSINESS.

264
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,900
YOU CAN WASH
YOUR NECK TOO.

265
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,700
PEANUTS!

266
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,100
HEY, COME HERE!

267
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,500

I WANNA SEE.

268
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,200
WHAT DO YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT FIREFLY?

269
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,800
YOU FIND OUT-A SOMETHING?
YOU NO FIND OUT-A SOMETHING?

270
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,100
YOU SPY ON HIM?
YOU NO SPY ON HIM?

271
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,600
WHAT'S-A MATTER?
ALL THE TIME I TALK, YOU NO SAY-A NOTHING.

272
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,100
WHAT'S-A MATTER

HEY, COME HERE.

276
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,100

277
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,700
COME ON,

278
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,600
UPSTAIRS THIS TIME,

279
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,600
COME ON.
WHAT YOU THINK YOU ARE, EH?

280
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,500
WHAT'S THE IDEA
OF FIGHTIN' IN FRONT OF MY PLACE...

281
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,900
AND DRIVING MY CUSTOMERS AWAY?
YOU GOT A MISTAKE SOMEPLACE.

282
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,100
I NO FIGHT.
THIS GUY HE'S-A WORKING FOR ME.

283
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,200
I ASK-A SOMETHING,
HE NO TELL-A ME NOTHING. ALL THE TIME HE NO SPEAK.

284
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,100
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE DO? HE GO MAKE-A FIGHT.
WHAT'S THE IDEA?

285
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
THAT'S-A NOT MY IDEA.
THAT'S-A HIS IDEA.

286
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,000
I SAY SOMETHING,
HE NO SAY NOTHING.

287
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,400
EVERY TIME I SPEAK --
WILL YOU SHUT UP!

288
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' AROUND HERE?

289
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600
WHO ARE YA?

290
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,400
CAN'T YOU -- CAN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING?

291
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,600
HE NO SAY NOTHING, HE --
AW, SHUT UP!

292
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,500
I AM-A SHUT UP,
BUT YOU NO UNDERSTAND.

293
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,300
HE'S A SPY AND I'M A SPY.
HE WORK-A FOR ME.

294
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,500
I WANT HIM TO FIND OUT SOMETHING
BUT HE NO FIND OUT.

295
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,000
HOW AM I GONNA FIND OUT
WHAT I WANNA FIND OUT...

296
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,500
IF HE NO FIND OUT WHAT I GOTTA FIND OUT?
WILL YOU QUIT ANNOYING ME?

297
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,900
ALL RIGHT, I QUIT.
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS MAKE HIM STOP DOING THIS.

298
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,600
JUST FOR THAT I'M GONNA
TEAR YOU LIMB FROM LIMB!

299
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,800
YOU'D THINK --

300
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,900
I NO SAY ONE THING, MISTER, BEFORE WHEN YOU --

301
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,300

00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,600
OH! NOW,

304
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,700
WHY, YOU --

305
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,700
I'LL TEACH YOU TO KICK ME!
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TEACH ME. I KNOW HOW.

306
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,400
STOP IT NOW. LOOK OUT!

307
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,200

00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,700
HEY!

310
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,200
DO YOU WANT TO BE
A PUBLIC NUISANCE?

311
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,700
SURE, HOW MUCH
DOES THE JOB PAY?

312
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,200
I'VE GOT A GOOD MIND TO
JOIN A CLUB AND BEAT YOU OVER THE HEAD WITH IT.

313
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,700
PEANUTS... TO YOU!

314
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
HAVE YOU GOT A LICENSE?
LICENSE?

315
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,700
NO, BUT MY DOG,
HE'S GOTTA MILLIONS OF 'EM.

316
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,500
HE'S SOME SMART DOG.
HE WENT WITH ADMIRAL BYRD TO THE POLE.

317
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,900
I'LL BET THE DOG
GOT TO THE POLE FIRST.

318
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,700
YOU WIN.

319
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,600
COME UP.
I WANNA SCARE THE CABINET.

320
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,100
HELLO?
NO, HE'S NOT IN.

321
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,400
ALL RIGHT, I TELL HIM.
GOOD-BYE. THAT WAS FOR YOU.

322
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,100
I'M SORRY I'M NOT IN.
I WANT TO HAVE A LONG TALK WITH YOU.

323
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,600
YOU GIVE UP THAT SILLY
PEANUT STAND AND I'LL GET YOU A SOFT GOVERNMENT JOB.

324
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,000
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE A JOB IN THE MINT?
MINT?

325
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,400
NO, NO.
I NO LIKE-A MINT.

326
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
WHAT OTHER FLAVOR YOU GOT?

327
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,000
HELLO?
NO, NOT YET.

328
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,600
ALL RIGHT, I TELL HIM.
GOOD-BYE.

329
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,400
THAT WAS FOR YOU AGAIN.
I WONDER WHATEVER BECAME OF ME.

330
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,200
I SHOULD'VE BEEN BACK HERE
A LONG TIME AGO.

331
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,400
I'VE GOT A SWELL JOB FOR
YOU, BUT FIRST I HAVE TO ASK IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.

332
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,800
WHAT IS IT THAT HAS
FOUR PAIR OF PANTS,

333
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,700
LIVES IN PHILADELPHIA,

334
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,800
AND IT NEVER RAINS
BUT IT POURS?

335
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,800
THAT'S A GOOD ONE. I GIVE YOU THREE GUESSES.
LET ME SEE.

336
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
HAS FOUR PAIR OF PANTS,
LIVES IN PHILADELPHIA.

337
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,500
MALE OR FEMALE?
NO, I NO THINK SO.

338
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,200
IS HE DEAD?
WHO?

339
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,900
I DON'T KNOW. I GIVE UP!
I GIVE UP TOO.

340
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,400
NOW I ASK YOU
ANOTHER ONE.

341
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,500
WHAT IS IT GOT
BIG BLACK MOUSTACHE,

342
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,100
SMOKES A
BIG BLACK CIGAR...

343
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,200
AND HE'S A BIG PAIN IN THE NECK?
DON'T TELL ME.

344
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,000
HAS A BIG
BLACK MOUSTACHE,

345
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,400
SMOKES A
BIG BLACK CIGAR,

346
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,600
AND IS A BIG
PAIN IN THE --

347
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,500
DOES HE WEAR GLASSES?
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU GUESS IT QUICK.

348
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,500
JUST FOR THAT YOU DON'T GET THE JOB.
WHAT JOB?

349
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,200
SECRETARY OF WAR!
ALL RIGHT, I TAKE IT.

350
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
I'D BE LOST WITHOUT A TELEPHONE.

351
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,800
DON'T GO AWAY,
I WANNA TALK TO YOU.

352
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,400
OH, YES, NOW THAT
YOU'RE SECRETARY OF WAR,

353
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,100
WHAT KIND OF AN ARMY DO YOU THINK WE OUGHTA HAVE?
WE SHOULD HAVE A STANDING ARMY.

354
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,800
WHY SHOULD WE HAVE A STANDING ARMY?

355
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,300
THEN WE SAVE MONEY
ON CHAIRS!

356
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,900
PEANUTS

357
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,700
SCAT!

358
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,500
SAY, WHO ARE YOU
ANYWAY?

359
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,300
I DON'T GO IN MUCH
FOR MODERN ART.

360
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,600
HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING
BY ONE OF THE OLD MASTERS?

361
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,600
NOT BAD.

362
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE
HER TELEPHONE NUMBER.

363
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,800
SAY, YOU COULD BE
A BIG HELP TO ME.

364
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,600
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

365
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,100
IT'S NOT MUCH OF A PLACE,
BUT IT'S HOME. MEOW!

366
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,100
I KNOW ONE THING,

367
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,200
I BET YOU HAVEN'T GOT
A PICTURE OF MY GRANDFATHER.

368
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,900
UH-UH! NOT NOW.
SOME OTHER TIME.

369
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,100
YOUR EXCELLENCY?
QUIET!

370
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,500
THIS LETTER'S THE WORK
OF TRENTINO.

371
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,900
THE MAN IS TRYING
TO UNDERMINE YOU. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

372
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,000
I'VE GOT A GOOD MIND TO
RING HIS DOORBELL AND RUN.

373
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,300
WE'VE GOT TO GET RID
OF THAT MAN AT ONCE. I'VE GOT A PLAN.

374
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,600
YOU SAY SOMETHING TO MAKE
HIM MAD AND HE'LL STRIKE YOU!

375
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,200
AND WE FORCE HIM TO LEAVE.
WHY COULDN'T YOU ARRANGE FOR ME TO STRIKE HIM?

376
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,500
AMBASSADOR TRENTINO
IS A VERY SENSITIVE MAN.

377
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,100
HE'S VERY EASY
TO INSULT.

378
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,200
WHY, I SAID SOMETHING TO
VERA MARCAL IN HIS PRESENCE AND HE SLAPPED MY FACE.

379
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
WHY DIDN'T VERA SLAP YOUR FACE?
SHE DID.

380
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,900
WHAT'D YOU SAY
TO HER?

381
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,800
YOU OUGHTA BE ASHAMED. WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT STORY?
YOU TOLD IT TO ME.

382
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,100
OH YES!
I REMEMBER.

383
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,500
I SHOULD'VE SLAPPED
MRS. TEASDALE'S FACE WHEN SHE TOLD IT TO ME.

384
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,600
WHERE IS TRENTINO?
AT MRS. TEASDALE'S TEA PARTY.

385
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,000
WAS I INVITED? TAKE A LETTER.
NO.

386
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,500
YOU ARE CORDIALLY INVITED
TO ATTEND MY TEA PARTY.

387
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,200
SIGN MRS. TEASDALE'S NAME
AND TELL HER I ACCEPT.

388
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,900
COME ON, LET'S GO.

389
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,600
I'VE GOT AN APPOINTMENT TO INSULT AMBASSADOR TRENTINO.

390
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,800
I DON'T WANT TO
KEEP HIM WAITING. STEP ON IT!

391
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,300
THIS IS THE FIFTH TRIP
I'VE MADE TODAY AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE YET.

392
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,500
YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE
MAKING PROGRESS WITH MRS. TEASDALE, HUH?

393
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,700
EVERY TIME I GET HER IN
THE RIGHT MOOD TO SAY "YES," FIREFLY POPS IN.

394
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,200
WELL, THIS IS
YOUR OPPORTUNITY. HE WON'T BE HERE TODAY.

395
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,600
ARE YOU SURE?
POSITIVE!

396
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,200
I HELPED MRS. TEASDALE WITH THE INVITATIONS.
OH!

397
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,900
HIS EXCELLENCY,
RUFUS T. FIREFLY.

398
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,200
HAIL, HAIL FREEDONIA

399
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
LAND OF THE BRAVE
AND FREE

400
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,600
GLORIA, I CAN'T BE
PUT OFF ANY LONGER.

401
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,200
I LOVE YOU, I WANT YOU!
CAN'T YOU SEE I'M AT YOUR FEET?

402
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,100
WHEN YOU GET THROUGH
WITH HER FEET, YOU CAN START ON MINE.

403
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,800
IF THAT ISN'T AN INSULT,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

404
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,300
GLORIA, I LOVE YOU.
I REALIZE HOW LONELY YOU ARE.

405
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,300
CAN'T WE GO SOMEPLACE
WHERE WE CAN BE BY OURSELVES?

406
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,400
WHAT CAN THIS MUG OFFER YOU?
WEALTH AND FAMILY?

407
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,900
I CAN'T GIVE YOU WEALTH,
BUT... WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE FAMILY OF OUR OWN.

408
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,900
OH, RUFUS!

409
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,900
ALL I CAN OFFER YOU IS
A "ROOFUS" OVER YOUR HEAD.

410
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,500
YOUR EXCELLENCY, I REALLY
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

411
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,000
I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
IF I WAS IN YOUR PLACE. MAYBE YOU CAN SUGGEST SOMETHING.

412
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,000
YOU DO SUGGEST SOMETHING. TO ME YOU SUGGEST A BABOON.
WHAT?

413
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,400
I'M SORRY I SAID THAT.
IT ISN'T FAIR TO THE REST OF THE BABOONS.

414
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,900
THIS MAN'S CONDUCT
IS INEXCUSABLE!

415
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,700
GENTLEMEN!
I DID NOT COME HERE TO BE INSULTED.

416
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,900
YOU SWINE!
COME AGAIN?

417
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,400
YOU WORM!
ONCE MORE.

418
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,100
YOU UPSTART!
THAT'S IT!

419
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,100
Touche.
I'M AFRAID THIS REGRETTABLE OCCURRENCE...

420
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,700
MAY PLUNGE OUR COUNTRIES INTO WAR.
THIS IS TERRIBLE!

421
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,600
I'VE SAID ENOUGH.
I'M A MAN OF FEW WORDS.

422
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,100
I'M A MAN OF ONE WORD.
SCRAM!

423
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,200
A MAN DOESN'T LIVE WHO CAN
CALL A FIREFLY AN UPSTART.

424
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,100
THE MAYFLOWER WAS FULL
OF FIREFLYS... AND A FEW HORSEFLIES TOO.

425
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,700
THE FIREFLYS WERE
ON THE UPPER DECK...

426
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,600
AND THE HORSEFLIES
WERE ON THE FIREFLYS.

427
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,900
GOOD DAY, MY SWEET.
YOUR EXCELLENCY, I MUST SPEAK TO YOU!

428
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,100
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE THEATER.
I'LL HOLD YOUR SEAT 'TIL YOU GET THERE.

429
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,000
AFTER YOU GET THERE, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
HIS EXCELLENCY'S CAR.

430
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,800
HIS EXCELLENCY'S CAR!

431
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,400
NO, YOU DON'T.
I'M NOT TAKING ANY MORE CHANCES.

432
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,700
YOU CAN ONLY FOOL
A FIREFLY TWICE. YOU RIDE IN THE SIDECAR.

433
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,500
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY
TO TRAVEL.

434
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,400
HEY, PINKY,
COME HERE.

435
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,000
WATCH-A THE STAND.
COME ON, PASTRAMI.

436
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,900
OH!

437
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,100
HEY!
HEY WHAT'S --

438
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,700
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

439
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,600
I DEEPLY REGRET
THE UNFORTUNATE AFFAIR WITH HIS EXCELLENCY,

440
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,100
BUT HIS ATTITUDE LEFT ME
NO ALTERNATIVE.

441
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,400
MAYBE WE CAN STILL AVOID THIS TERRIBLE WAR.
IF WE ONLY COULD.

442
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,800
OH YES, I --
AH!

443
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,900
MRS. TEASDALE, I HAVE BEEN
RECALLED BY MY PRESIDENT.

444
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,000
THEN IT'S TOO LATE?
NOT IF HIS EXCELLENCY WILL LISTEN TO REASON.

445
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,900
I AM PREPARED TO POCKET
MY PRIDE AND FORGET THE MATTER... IF HE IS.

446
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,200
THAT'S WONDERFUL BUT
I'M AFRAID HIS EXCELLENCY WON'T HEAR OF IT.

447
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,000
PERHAPS HE WILL
LISTEN TO YOU!

448
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,200
DO YOU THINK SO?
YES, OF COURSE!

449
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,900
I'LL CALL HIM.
OH!

450
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,400
I HATE TO DISTURB YOU,

451
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,700
BUT I MUST SEE YOU
AT ONCE.

452
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,800
WHERE ARE YOU?
OH.

453
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,200
WHY NOT COME OVER HERE?
COME IN THE BACK WAY. NO ONE WILL SEE YOU.

454
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,000
IF YOU THINK OF IT,
BRING SOME CHEESE.

455
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
YOU MUST COME OVER.

456
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,200
IT'S A LONG STORY.
I CAN'T TELL IT TO YOU OVER THE PHONE.

457
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,200
OH, IT'S THAT KIND
OF A STORY!

458
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,600
YOU OUGHTA BE ASHAMED.
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

459
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,100
HE'LL BE RIGHT OVER.
WAIT OUTSIDE 'TIL I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO HIM.

460
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,000
WE'LL BE OUT HERE
IF YOU WANT US.

461
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,400
OH!
HOW'D YOU GET IN HERE?

462
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,600
I'M SO SORRY
TO HAVE TO DISTURB YOU!

463
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,600
WILL YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?
AFTER I LEAVE TONIGHT, WILL YOU FORGIVE ME?

464
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,300
HERE ARE
THE PLANS OF WAR.

465
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,800
THEY'RE AS VALUABLE
AS YOUR LIFE AND THAT'S PUTTING THEM PRETTY CHEAP.

466
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,900
WATCH THEM LIKE A CAT
WATCHES HER KITTENS. HAVE YOU EVER HAD KITTENS?

467
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,200
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
YOU'RE TOO BUSY PLAYING BRIDGE.

468
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,300
CAN'T YOU SEE I'M TRYING
TO TELL YOU, "I LOVE YOU."

469
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,300
WHY DON'T YOU MARRY ME?
WHY, MARRY YOU?

470
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,800
YOU TAKE ME
AND I'LL TAKE A VACATION.

471
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,900
I'LL NEED A VACATION
IF WE'RE GOING TO GET MARRIED.

472
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,800
MARRIED! I CAN SEE YOU
BENDING OVER A HOT STOVE BUT I CAN'T SEE THE STOVE!

473
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,900
COME, COME, SAY THE WORD
AND YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN.

474
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,000
GLORIA.

475
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,600
RUFUS, WHAT ARE
YOU THINKING OF?

476
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,100
OF ALL THE YEARS
I'VE WASTED COLLECTING STAMPS.

477
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,100
OH!

478
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,300
OH, I SUPPOSE YOU'LL THINK ME
A SENTIMENTAL OLD FLUFF,

479
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,600
BUT WOULD YOU MIND GIVING ME A LOCK OF YOUR HAIR?
A LOCK OF MY HAIR?

480
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,200
OH, I HAD NO IDEA --

481
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,500
I'M LETTING YOU OFF EASY.
I WAS GONNA ASK FOR THE WHOLE WIG.

482
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,200
SO YOU'VE COME TO ASK
FOR CLEMENCY?

483
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,700
THE AMBASSADOR'S HERE
ON A FRIENDLY VISIT. HE'S HAD A CHANGE OF HEART.

484
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,600
A LOT OF GOOD THAT'LL DO HIM.
HE'S STILL GOT THE SAME FACE.

485
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,200
I'M SORRY WE LOST OUR
TEMPERS. I'M WILLING TO FORGET IF YOU ARE.

486
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,100
FORGET?
YOU ASK ME TO FORGET?

487
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,100
A FIREFLY NEVER FORGETS.

488
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,900
WHY, MY ANCESTORS WOULD RISE
FROM THEIR GRAVES AND I'D ONLY HAVE TO BURY THEM AGAIN.

489
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,800
I'M GOING BACK AND CLEAN
THE CRACKERS OUT OF MY BED. I'M EXPECTING COMPANY.

490
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,000
PLEASE WAIT.
LET GO OF ME, YOU BULLY!

491
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,600
I'M WILLING TO DO ANYTHING
TO PREVENT THIS WAR.

492
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,400
IT'S TOO LATE.
I'VE ALREADY PAID A MONTH'S RENT ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

493
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,700
OH, YOUR EXCELLENCY,
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING I CAN DO?

494
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,500
YES, BUT I'LL TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THAT LATER.

495
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,600
WON'T YOU RECONSIDER?
PLEASE RELENT FOR MY SAKE.

496
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,800
WELL, MAYBE I AM
A LITTLE HEADSTRONG.

497
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,700
I COME BY IT HONESTLY. MY
FATHER WAS A LITTLE HEADSTRONG.

498
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,700
MY MOTHER WAS
A LITTLE ARMSTRONG.

499
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,200
THE HEADSTRONGS
MARRIED THE ARMSTRONGS AND THAT'S WHY DARKIES WERE BORN.

500
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,000
IT WAS SILLY OF ME
TO LOSE MY TEMPER...

501
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
ON ACCOUNT OF THAT
LITTLE THING YOU CALLED ME.

502
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,600
LITTLE THING I CALLED YOU?
WHAT DID I CALL YOU?

503
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
GOSH, I DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS.

504
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,400
WELL, DO YOU MEAN "WORM"?
NO, THAT WASN'T IT.

505
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,400
I KNOW, "SWINE."
UH-UH.

506
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,500
NO, IT WAS A
SEVEN LETTER WORD.

507
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,400
OH YES, "UPSTART."
THAT'S IT. UPSTART.

508
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,600
MRS. TEASDALE,
THIS MAN IS IMPOSSIBLE.

509
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
MY COURSE IS CLEAR. THIS MEANS WAR!
OH!

510
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
YOU RUNT!
I STILL LIKE UPSTART THE BEST.

511
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,900
I SHAN'T STAY.
GO AND NEVER DARKEN MY TOWELS AGAIN!

512
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,000
MY HAT!
MY TOWEL!

513
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,000
I HAPPEN TO KNOW...

514
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,400
THAT FREEDONIA'S
PLANS OF WAR ARE IN MRS. TEASDALES POSSESSION.

515
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,300
I MUST GET HOLD OF THEM.
YES, BUT HOW?

516
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,800
WE HAVE A WEEKEND GUEST
IN MRS. TEASDALE'S HOUSE.

517
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,800
MISS MARCAL.

518
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,700
GENTLEMEN, DO YOU MIND
WAITING FOR ME OUTSIDE? I'LL JOIN YOU IN A MOMENT.

519
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,500
EXCUSE ME.

520
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,500
HELLO?

521
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,400
YES, I AM ALONE.
NO, NOT YET.

522
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,800
WE'VE GOT TO WORK FAST.
YOU MUST GET HOLD OF THOSE PLANS TONIGHT.

523
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,800
CHICOLINI AND HIS PARTNER
SHOULD BE THERE ANY MINUTE. DO EVERYTHING TO HELP THEM.

524
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,900
I MUST BE VERY CAREFUL.
THERE IS ANOTHER GUEST.

525
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,700
FIREFLY.
I THINK HE IS ASLEEP.

526
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,300
RING THE BELL.

527
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,000
PUSH THE BUTTON.

528
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,800
YOU GOTTA THE PLANS?
NO, BUT THEY'RE SOMEWHERES IN THE HOUSE.

529
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,700
YOU MUST FIND THEM.
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T MAKE A SOUND.

530
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,300
IF YOU'RE FOUND, YOU'RE LOST.
YOU CRAZ', HOW CAN I BE LOST IF I'M FOUND?

531
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,200
GOT A FLASHLIGHT?

532
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,200
SHH! SHH!

533
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,900
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
SERIOUS THIS IS.

534
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,900
IF THEY CATCH YOU, YOU'LL
BE COURT-MARTIALED AND SHOT.

535
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,300
OH, VERA!

536
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,600
I MUST GO BEFORE
SHE LOOKS FOR ME.

537
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,700
REMEMBER,
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T MAKE A SOUND.

538
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,200
YOU STAY HERE,
BUT KEEP QUIET.

539
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,800
IF WE GET CAUGHT,
WE'RE GONNA GET, UH, COURT-PLASTERED.

540
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,700
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
I'M WORRIED. I CAN'T SLEEP.

541
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,400
WHAT? YOU'RE WORRIED?
YOU CAN'T SLEEP?

542
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,400
YOU WOKE ME UP.
NOW I CAN'T SLEEP.

543
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,900
IT'S ABOUT THOSE PLANS.
I WON'T REST UNTIL THEY'RE BACK IN YOUR HANDS.

544
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,500
WON'T YOU COME OVER
AND GET THEM?

545
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,800
OH, THE PLANS.
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

546
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,000
LET ME OUT!
LET ME OUT!

547
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,500
LET ME OUTTA HERE!

548
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,600
HEY, LET ME OUTTA HERE
OR THROW ME A MAGAZINE.

549
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,000
SO THAT'S YOUR GAME, EH?
I'LL HUFF AND I'LL PUFF...

550
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,900
AND I'LL BLOW YOUR DOOR IN.

551
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,600
COME IN.

552
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,300
OH, YOUR EXCELLENCY,
I'M SO GLAD YOU'VE COME.

553
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,900
I'M GLAD I COME TOO.
YOU GOTTA THE PLANS?

554
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,000
WHY, YOUR EXCELLENCY,
YOU SOUND SO STRANGE. WHY ARE YOU TALKING LIKE THAT?

555
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,400
YOU SEE, MAYBE SOMETIME
I GO TO ITALY AND I'M PRACTICIN' THE LANGUAGE.

556
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,400
I'LL SEE MY LAWYER
ABOUT THIS AS SOON AS HE GRADUATES FROM LAW SCHOOL.

557
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,000
YOUR DIALECT IS PERFECT.
I COULD LISTEN TO YOU ALL NIGHT.

558
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, BUT I
CAN'T STAY HERE ALL NIGHT.

559
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,300
WHERE'S THE PLANS?
THEY'RE IN THE SAFE DOWNSTAIRS. I'LL WRITE OUT THE COMBINATION.

560
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,800
OH, THERE YOU ARE.
HERE'S THE COMBINATION. IS THAT CLEAR?

561
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANT TO KNOW?

562
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,600
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR VOICE?

563
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,900
LET ME GET YOU A GLASS OF WATER,
YOUR EXCELLENCY.

564
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,500
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
HERE'S YOUR WATER!

565
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,900
WHAT IN THE WORLD'S
THE MATTER?

566
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,200
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
I THOUGHT YOU LEFT.

567
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,400
OH NO, I NO LEAVE.
BUT I SAW YOU WITH MY OWN EYES.

568
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,000
WHO YA GONNA BELIEVE, ME OR YOUR OWN EYES?
OH.

569
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,100
YOUR EXCELLENCY, I'M SORRY,
BUT THIS EXCITEMENT'S TOO MUCH FOR ME.

570
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,600
I FEEL FAINT.
WAIT, I GET YOU A GLASS OF WATER.

571
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,200
HOW ABOUT MY GLASS OF WATER?
I GIVE UP. HOW ABOUT YOUR GLASS OF WATER?

572
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,100
- WHAT'S THAT?

573
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,600
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE MICE.
MICE? MICE DON'T PLAY MUSIC.

574
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,200
NO? HOW ABOUT THE OLD MAESTRO?
OH!

575
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,900
GET ME HEADQUARTERS.
NOT HINDQUARTERS, HEADQUARTERS.

576
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,200
HELLO? RUSH THE GUARDS
TO MRS. TEASDALE'S AND HAVE 'EM SURROUND THE HOUSE.

577
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,100
HIS EXCELLENCY,
RUFUS T. FIREFLY.

578
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,400
HAIL, HAIL
FREEDONIA

579
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,500
LAND OF THE BRAVE
AND FREE

580
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,300
LIEUTENANT, WHY WEREN'T
THE ORIGINAL INDICTMENT PAPERS PLACED IN MY PORTFOLIO?

581
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,400
I DIDN'T THINK THOSE
PAPERS WERE IMPORTANT, YOUR EXCELLENCY.

582
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,400
YOU DIDN'T THINK
THEY WERE IMPORTANT?

583
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,600
YOU REALIZE I HAD MY DESSERT
WRAPPED IN THOSE PAPERS?

584
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,400
TAKE THIS BOTTLE BACK.
YOU CAN GET TWO CENTS FOR IT.

585
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,700
HELLO, BOSS.

586
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,600
CHICOLINI, I BET YOU
EIGHT TO ONE WE FIND YOU GUILTY.

587
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,400
THAT'S-A NO GOOD.
I CAN GET TEN TO ONE AT THE BARBERSHOP.

588
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,300
CHICOLINI, YOU'RE
CHARGED WITH HIGH TREASON. IF FOUND GUILTY, YOU'LL BE SHOT.

589
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,200
I OBJECT.
YOU OBJECT?

590
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,800
ON WHAT GROUNDS?
I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY.

591
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,600
- OBJECTION SUSTAINED.
- YOU SUSTAINED THE OBJECTION?

592
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,200
SURE, I COULDN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY EITHER.

593
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,200
WHEN WERE YOU BORN?

594
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,900
I DON'T REMEMBER.
I WAS JUST A LITTLE BABY.

595
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,200
ISN'T IT TRUE YOU TRIED
TO SELL FREEDONIA'S SECRET WAR CODE AND PLANS?

596
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,400
SURE, I SOLD A CODE
AND TWO PAIR OF PLANS.

597
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,900
SOME JOKE, EH, BOSS?

598
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,800
I'LL BET YA 20 TO ONE
WE FIND YA GUILTY.

599
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,300
HAVE YOU ANYONE HERE
TO DEFEND YOU?

600
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,200
IT'S-A NO USE.
I EVEN OFFERED TO PAY AS HIGH AS $18.

601
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,900
BUT I NO COULD GETTA
SOMEBODY TO DEFEND ME.

602
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,900
MY FRIENDS, THIS MAN'S
CASE MOVES ME DEEPLY.

603
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,800
LOOK AT CHICOLINI,
HE SITS THERE ALONE.

604
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,400
AN ABJECT FIGURE.
I "ABJECT"!

605
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,200
I SAY, LOOK AT CHICOLINI,
HE SITS THERE ALONE, A PITIABLE OBJECT.

606
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,000
LET'S SEE YA GET
OUTTA THAT ONE. SURROUNDED BY A SEA OF UNFRIENDLY FACES.

607
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,700
CHICOLINI, GIVE ME
A NUMBER FROM ONE TO TEN.

608
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,200
ELEVEN.
RIGHT!

609
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,400
NOW I ASK YOU ONE.
WHAT IS IT HAS A TRUNK, BUT NO KEY,

610
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,400
WEIGHS 2,000 POUNDS
AND LIVES IN A CIRCUS?

611
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,100
THAT'S IRRELEVANT.
"RELEPHANT"!

612
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,600
HEY, THAT'S THE ANSWER.
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF RELEPHANTS IN A CIRCUS.

613
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,900
THAT SORT OF TESTIMONY
WE CAN ELIMINATE.

614
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,000
- THAT'S-A FINE, I'LL TAKE SOME.
- YOU'LL TAKE WHAT?

615
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,900
ELIMINATE, A NICE,
COLD GLASS OF ELIMINATE.

616
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,700
HEY, BOSS,
I'M GOIN' GOOD.

617
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,200
GENTLEMEN, CHICOLINI HERE
MAY TALK LIKE AN IDIOT AND LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.

618
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,500
BUT DON'T LET THAT FOOL YOU.
HE REALLY IS AN IDIOT.

619
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,500
I IMPLORE YOU.
SEND HIM BACK TO HIS FATHER AND BROTHERS...

620
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,000
WHO ARE WAITING
FOR HIM WITH OPEN ARMS IN THE PENITENTIARY.

621
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,300
I SUGGEST WE GIVE HIM
TEN YEARS IN LEAVENWORTH OR 11 YEARS IN TWELVEWORTH.

622
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,100
I'LL TAKE
FIVE AND TEN IN WOOLWORTH.

623
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,700
I WANTED TO GET A WRIT OF
HABEAS CORPUS, BUT I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A WRIT OF YOU.

624
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,600
I OBJECT.
EVEN I OBJECT.

625
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,700
- I OBJECT TOO.
- YOU'RE ON TRIAL, YOU CAN'T.

626
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,400
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
GENERAL COOPER SAYS...

627
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,500
THAT THE SYLVANIAN TROOPS
ARE ABOUT TO LAND ON FREEDONIAN SOIL.

628
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,400
THIS MEANS WAR!
SOMETHING MUST BE DONE.

629
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,400
WAR WOULD MEAN A PROHIBITIVE
INCREASE IN OUR TAXES.

630
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,400
HEY, I GOT AN UNCLE LIVES IN TAXES.
NO!

631
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,500
I'M TALKING ABOUT
TAXES, MONEY, DOLLARS.

632
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,300
DOLLAS! THAT'S WHERE
MY UNCLE LIVES, DOLLAS, TAXES.

633
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,100
MORE BAD NEWS.

634
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,400
DIDN'T I TELL YA?
YOUR EXCELLENCY.

635
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,100
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, BABE?
ON BEHALF OF THE WOMEN OF FREEDONIA,

636
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,400
I HAVE TAKEN IT UPON MYSELF
TO MAKE ONE FINAL EFFORT TO PREVENT WAR.

637
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,600
NO KIDDING?
I'VE TALKED TO AMBASSADOR TRENTINO.

638
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,000
HE SAYS SYLVANIA
DOESN'T WANT WAR EITHER.

639
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,800
"EITHER."
DOESN'T WANT WAR "EITHER."

640
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,000
EITHER.
SKIP IT.

641
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,100
I'VE TAKEN THE LIBERTY
OF ASKING THE AMBASSADOR TO COME OVER HERE.

642
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,000
WE BOTH FELT A FRIENDLY
CONFERENCE WOULD SETTLE EVERYTHING PEACEFULLY.

643
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,100
HE'LL BE HERE
ANY MOMENT.

644
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,800
MRS. TEASDALE,
YOU DID A NOBLE DEED.

645
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,000
I'D BE UNWORTHY OF
THE HIGH TRUST THAT'S BEEN PLACED IN ME...

646
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,600
IF I DIDN'T DO EVERYTHING
WITHIN MY POWER TO KEEP OUR FREEDONIA AT PEACE.

647
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,200
I'D BE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO
MEET AMBASSADOR TRENTINO...

648
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,800
AND OFFER HIM ON BEHALF
OF MY COUNTRY THE RIGHT HAND OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP.

649
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,700
I FEEL SURE HE WILL ACCEPT
THIS GESTURE IN THE SPIRIT IN WHICH IT IS OFFERED.

650
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
BUT SUPPOSE HE DOESN'T.
A FINE THING THAT'LL BE.

651
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,200
I HOLD OUT MY HAND AND
HE REFUSES TO ACCEPT IT.

652
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,900
THAT'LL ADD A LOT TO
MY PRESTIGE, WON'T IT?

653
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:34,200
ME, THE HEAD OF A COUNTRY,
SNUBBED BY A FOREIGN AMBASSADOR!

654
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,300
WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS
THAT HE CAN COME HERE...

655
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,400
AND MAKE A SAP OUT OF ME
IN FRONT OF MY PEOPLE?

656
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,500
THINK OF IT.
I HOLD OUT MY HAND...

657
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,100
AND THAT HYENA
REFUSES TO ACCEPT IT.

658
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,700
WHY, THE CHEAP
FOUR-FLUSHING SWINE!

659
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,700
HE'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH IT,
I TELL YOU!

660
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,000
OH, PLEASE!

661
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
SO, YOU REFUSE TO SHAKE
HANDS WITH ME, EH?

662
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,800
MRS. TEASDALE, THIS IS
THE LAST STRAW! THERE'S NO TURNING BACK NOW!

663
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,600
THIS MEANS WAR!

664
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,800
THEN IT'S WAR!

665
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,300
THEN IT'S WAR!
GATHER THE FORCES!

666
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,100
HARNESS THE HORSES!
THEN IT'S WAR!

667
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,000
- FREEDONIA'S GOING TO WAR
- EACH SON WILL GRAB A GUN

668
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,500
- AND RUN AWAY TO WAR
- AT LAST WE'RE GOING TO

669
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,000
FEET WILL BEAT ALONG
THE STREET TO WAR

670
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,100
- WE'RE GOING TO WAR
- OUR COUNTRY'S GOING TO WAR

671
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,600
- OUR COUNTRY'S GOING TO WAR
- THE COUNTRY'S GOING TO WAR

672
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,800
WE'RE GOING TO WAR
THIS IS A FACT WE CAN'T IGNORE

673
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,800
WE'RE GOING TO WAR, THIS IS
A FACT WE CAN'T IGNORE WE'RE GOING TO WAR

674
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,100
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
THEY THINK WE'RE GOING TO WAR

675
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,800
WE'RE GOING TO WAR
I THINK THEY THINK WE'RE GOING TO WAR

676
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,900
WE'RE GOING TO WAR
GOING TO WAR

677
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,200
- WE'RE GOING TO WAR
- WE'RE GOING TO WAR

678
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,900
TO WAR, TO WAR
WE'RE FINALLY GOING TO WAR

679
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,700
HI-DE, HI-DE
HI-DE, HI-DE HO

00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,200
THEY GOT GUNS
WE GOT GUNS

690
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,400
ALL GOD'S CHILDREN
GOT GUNS

691
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,600
WE'RE GONNA WALK ALL OVER
THE BATTLEFIELD

692
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,200
'CAUSE ALL GOD'S
CHILDREN GOT GUNS

693
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,000
OH FREEDONIA
OH DON'T YOU CRY FOR ME

694
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,800
'CAUSE I'M COMING
'ROUND THE MOUNTAIN WITH A BANJO ON MY KNEE

695
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,000
OH FREEDONIA
OH DON'T YOU CRY FOR ME

696
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,300
'CAUSE I'M COMING
'ROUND THE MOUNTAIN

697
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,800
WITH A BANJO

698
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,300
ON MY

699
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,500
TO WAR, TO WAR
TO WAR WE'RE GONNA GO

700
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,700
TO WAR, TO WAR
TO WAR

701
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,700
TO WAR, TO WAR
WE SOON WILL SAY GOOD-BYE

702
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,100
HOW WE'LL CRY FOR FIREFLY
IF FIREFLY SHOULD DIE

703
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,500
A MIGHTY MAN IS HE

704
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,800
A MAN OF BRAWN WHO'LL CARRY ON
'TIL DAWN OF VICTORY

705
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,200
WITH HIM TO LEAD THE WAY
OUR SPIRITS WILL NOT LAG

706
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,400
UNTIL THE JUDGMENT DAY
WE'LL RALLY 'ROUND THE FLAG

707
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,500
THE FLAG, THE FLAG
THE FLAG

708
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,600
THERE'LL BE TWO LAMPS
IN THE STEEPLE IF BY LAND AND ONE IF BY SEA.

709
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,300
THEY DOUBLE-CROSSED ME.
THEY'RE COMING BY LAND AND SEA!

710
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,500
RIDE THROUGH EVERY VILLAGE.
WAKE EVERY CITIZEN UP.

711
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,100
TELL 'EM THE ENEMY COMES FROM
AFAR WITH A HEY NONNY-NONNY AND A HA-CHA-CHA!

712
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,600
BE OFF, MY LAD!

713
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,300
MY HUSBAND!
HIDE IN THERE!

714
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,300
OH, DON'T.

715
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,200
FREEDONIA'S GOING TO WAR!
I'M GONNA TAKE A BATH.

716
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,300
CLEAR ALL WIRES.
THE ENEMY HAS CAPTURED HILL 27 AND 28...

717
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,500
THROWING 13 HILLBILLIES
OUT OF WORK.

718
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,000
LAST NIGHT TWO SNIPERS
CREPT INTO OUR MACHINE-GUN NEST AND LAID AN EGG.

719
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,100
SEND REINFORCEMENTS.
SEND THAT OFF COLLECT.

720
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,600
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
OUR MEN ARE BEING BADLY BEATEN IN OPEN WARFARE.

721
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,700
I SUGGEST WE DIG TRENCHES.
DIG TRENCHES?

722
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:31,300
WITH OUR MEN BEING KILLED
OFF LIKE FLIES THERE ISN'T TIME TO DIG TRENCHES.

723
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,200
WE'LL BUY READY-MADE. HERE, GET SOME TRENCHES.
YES, SIR.

724
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,700
WAIT A MINUTE, GET 'EM
THIS HIGH AND OUR SOLDIERS WON'T NEED ANY PANTS.

725
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,800
YES, SIR.
WAIT A MINUTE.

726
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,100
GET 'EM THIS HIGH AND WE WON'T NEED ANY SOLDIERS.
YES, SIR.

727
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,800
YOUR PARTNER'S DESERTED US,
BUT I'M STILL COUNTING ON YOU.

728
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,900
THERE'S A MACHINE-GUN
NEST NEAR HILL 28.

729
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,100
I WANT IT CLEANED OUT.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL THE JANITOR.

730
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,000
MESSAGE FROM
THE FRONT, SIR.

731
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,700
I'M SICK OF MESSAGES
FROM THE FRONT. DON'T WE EVER GET A MESSAGE FROM THE SIDE?

732
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,800
WHAT IS IT?
GENERAL SMITH REPORTS A GAS ATTACK.

733
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,900
HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT TO DO.
TAKE SODA AND WATER.

734
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,600
YES, SIR.

735
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,300
ANY ANSWER TO THAT MESSAGE?
NO, SIR.

736
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,500
IN THAT CASE,
DON'T SEND IT.

737
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,700
GENTLEMEN, THIS IS
THE LAST STRAW.

738
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,500
WHERE'S MY STRADIVARIUS?
HERE, SIR.

739
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,800
I'LL SHOW 'EM THEY
CAN'T FIDDLE AROUND WITH OLD FIREFLY.

740
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,700
LOOK AT 'EM RUN. NOW THEY KNOW THEY'VE BEEN IN A WAR.
YOUR EXCELLENCY!

741
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,700
THEY'RE FLEEING LIKE RATS!
SIR, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU --

742
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,700
REMIND ME TO GIVE MYSELF
THE FIREFLY MEDAL FOR THIS.

743
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,500
YOU'RE SHOOTING YOUR OWN MEN.
WHAT?

744
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,600
YOU'RE SHOOTING
YOUR OWN MEN!

745
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,100
HERE'S FIVE DOLLARS.
KEEP IT UNDER YOUR HAT. I'LL KEEP IT UNDER MY HAT.

746
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,600
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE MORE MEN OR WE'RE LOST.
I'VE GOT A MAN...

747
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,500
COMBING THE COUNTRY
FOR VOLUNTEERS.

748
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,900
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
THE ARMY'S MORALE IS CRUMBLING. THE MEN ARE BREAKING RANKS.

749
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,000
WHERE'S THE SECRETARY OF WAR?
WHERE IS THE SECRETARY OF WAR?

750
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,100
THE SOLDIERS ARE
WAITING FOR HIS ORDERS.

751
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,300
THE SECRETARY OF WAR.

752
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,000
AWFULLY DECENT OF
YOU TO DROP IN TODAY.

753
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,100
YOU REALIZE OUR ARMY IS
FACING DISASTROUS DEFEAT?

754
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,300
WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO?
I'VE DONE IT ALREADY.

755
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,100
YOU'VE DONE WHAT?
I'VE CHANGED TO THE OTHER SIDE.

756
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,500
SO YOU'RE ON THE OTHER
SIDE, EH? WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER HERE?

757
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,100
THE FOOD IS
BETTER OVER HERE.

758
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,400
CHICOLINI, I NEED YOU.
WHAT'LL YOU TAKE TO WORK FOR ME AGAIN?

759
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,500
I'LL TAKE A VACATION.
GOOD, YOU'RE HIRED.

760
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,300
NOW, GO OUT IN
THAT BATTLEFIELD AND LEAD THOSE MEN TO VICTORY.

761
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,300
GO ON, THEY'RE
WAITING FOR YOU.

762
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,200
I WOULDN'T GO THERE UNLESS I
WAS IN ONE OF THOSE IRON THINGS. WHAT DO YOU CALL THOSE THINGS?

763
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,200
TANKS.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

764
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,700
YOU MUST COME HERE AT ONCE.
THERE'S DANGER HERE.

765
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,600
COME HERE.
THERE'S NO DANGER HERE.

766
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,000
SHH!
RUFUS!

767
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,100
OH!

768
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,700
WAIT A MINUTE, I WANT
TO FIND OUT SOMETHING.

769
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,500
JUST AS I THOUGHT,
THE COAST IS CLEAR.

770
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,500
CHICOLINI, TO YOUR POST!
OH!

771
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,300
REMEMBER, YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR
THIS WOMAN'S HONOR WHICH IS PROBABLY MORE THAN SHE EVER DID.

772
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,000
YOUR EXCELLENCY!
THERE GOES MY GUN.

773
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,800
RUN OUT AND GET THAT LIKE A GOOD GIRL.
OH, I'M AFRAID.

774
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,400
WE CAN'T LAST MUCH LONGER. OUR AMMUNITION SUPPLIES ARE LOW.
MAN THE BOATS!

775
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:03,900
CALLING ALL NATIONS!
CALLING ALL NATIONS!

776
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:06,600
THIS IS RUFUS T. --

777
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:09,600
THIS IS RUFUS T. FIREFLY
COMIN' TO YOU THROUGH THE COURTESY OF THE ENEMY.

778
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,900
WE'RE IN A MESS, FOLKS!

779
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,300
RUSH TO FREEDONIA.
THREE MEN AND ONE WOMAN ARE TRAPPED IN A BUILDING.

780
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,100
SEND HELP AT ONCE.
IF YOU CAN'T SEND HELP, SEND TWO MORE WOMEN.

781
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,100
MAKE IT THREE MORE WOMEN.

782
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,400
WE CAN'T HOLD OUT!
WE MUST HAVE HELP.

783
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,400
ONE OF US HAS TO GET WORD
TO GENERAL COOPER.

784
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,500
QUIET BACK THERE.

785
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,900
WHICH ONE OF US IS GONNA
HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SACRIFICING HIS LIFE?

786
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,400
WE DRAW LOTS.
WAIT! I GOT IT.

787
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,400
RRRINGSPOT, VONZA, TWOZA,
ZIG-ZAG-ZAV, POPTI, VINAGA.
