1
00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:05,748
What women need

2
00:00:05,778 --> 00:00:07,368
is the same as what men need,

3
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:10,665
and that's the Marxist conception
in their consciousness.

4
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:13,649
Which would,
if accepted by both men and women,

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,592
destroy all anomalies in human society

6
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:22,575
that inhibit the progress and
the unity of the people,

7
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,294
good life, happiness, and idyll.

8
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:28,459
I've had some bad luck with women.

9
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:32,799
In the past fifteen years,
I have encountered around

10
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:37,687
twelve to thirteen thousand free girls,
namely divorcees and widows.

11
00:00:37,717 --> 00:00:40,218
They've all turned me down,

12
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:45,440
telling me: "back off, you piece of shit,
you swine, you bastard..."

13
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:48,075
That's incredible!

14
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:53,011
If they all spat on me at the same time,
these twelve to thirteen thousand,

15
00:00:53,214 --> 00:00:57,864
I would be covered in saliva as high as
Chicago's tallest skyscraper.

16
00:00:59,446 --> 00:01:03,274
To build socialism, one needs socialists.

17
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:05,996
And to get socialists...

18
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:08,354
it is essential...

19
00:01:08,553 --> 00:01:10,265
that I get permission...

20
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,303
from parliament...

21
00:01:12,717 --> 00:01:14,273
by a parliamentary decision...

22
00:01:14,303 --> 00:01:18,940
for one thousand girls, 20 to
25 years old, in Hotel Yugoslavia.

23
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:22,916
Which means five thousand socialists
in five years.

24
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:25,684
Because there's no socialism
without socialists.

25
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:27,557
As soon as they are born...

26
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,548
Namely, as soon as they're five years old,

27
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:31,405
they need to be given Marx's <i>The Capital</i>.

28
00:01:31,435 --> 00:01:33,284
This would achieve socialism...

29
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:35,459
and stabilise society.

30
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:45,793
Hotel Yugoslavia has to be promptly
turned into a Marxist institute.

31
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:48,838
The first in the world
for creating socialists.

32
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,454
I think if I found myself on some
other planet, outside of this one,

33
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:58,118
and had such a number
of socialists with me,

34
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:01,234
I would send an ultimatum from space

35
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:04,519
that everyone must subjugate
to socialism and Marxism

36
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:06,140
or be destroyed.

37
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:10,254
I, Cebic Stanoje,

38
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:13,854
Marxist fanatic,
metalworker of the European class,

39
00:02:13,874 --> 00:02:16,203
posses this item on my head:

40
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:19,903
A beret of the proletarians from Broadway.

41
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:24,327
On my back, an English-licenced blazer.

42
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:29,360
A German-licenced sweater.

43
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:36,903
A Yugoslavian shirt.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

45
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:47,809
A Yugoslavian undershirt.

46
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:56,392
Belgian-licenced trousers.

47
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:02,510
Yugoslavian underpants.

48
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:05,890
Yugoslavian socks.

49
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,068
Boots of <i>artillery</i> importance.

50
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:13,270
This is "alles kapital" for socialism!

51
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:21,527
Dammit...

52
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,199
I would paint all of this red...

53
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:31,326
and walls, and houses,
and roofs, and trees,

54
00:03:31,356 --> 00:03:36,103
and lampposts, and factories,
and people, and suits, and horses, and...

55
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:39,853
roads!
I would paint it all red!

56
00:03:40,627 --> 00:03:42,588
Even women's...

57
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:44,455
eyelashes.

58
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:46,895
With the colour red, not...

59
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:50,310
the colour of rot,
as they're colouring themselves today.

60
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,950
And we, the men, are disgusted by it.

61
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:59,240
So foreigners could see that they've
come to a red, workers' state.

62
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:07,058
Long live the greatest giants of work,
of European and world roads,

63
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:10,518
namely truck drivers,
the greatest humanists.

64
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:11,970
Three times "Thank You!"

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,983
<i>Merci beaucoup, Danke schön, grazie,
thank y... thank you very much!</i>

66
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,047
<i>Merci beaucoup, hvala!</i>

67
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:38,462
<i>Bitte schön, Herr, ich Yugoslave,
autostop Belgrad nach München.</i>

68
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:40,148
KOLT 15 GAP

69
00:04:40,178 --> 00:04:42,726
<i>Keine Arbeit, keine Geld.</i>

70
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:53,180
I'm a metalworker of the European class,

71
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,897
a Marxist, Lenin's emissary,

72
00:04:56,265 --> 00:05:00,101
who besides searching for a job...

73
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:08,247
is also on a Marxist mission
in every factory I pass through.

74
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,943
For the past twenty years, or namely,
for the past twenty-five years,

75
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:18,564
it hasn't hurt
to have had someone like me around,

76
00:05:18,594 --> 00:05:20,454
someone who's going against system.

77
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:24,454
And I'm confronting the state
only because...

78
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:29,069
after seeing 150 factories
throughout Yugoslavia,

79
00:05:29,944 --> 00:05:33,180
I've concluded that those working
the hardest get the lowest pay.

80
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,723
When I see all that,
I can't and I won't...

81
00:05:38,332 --> 00:05:41,989
and don't have any reason,
on principle,

82
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:44,876
to work.
Not even in my dreams!

83
00:05:46,003 --> 00:05:49,775
I was taught in Second Military School

84
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:52,743
not to work for exploiters.

85
00:05:53,024 --> 00:05:56,461
No matter where they come from.

86
00:05:57,688 --> 00:05:58,840
So...

87
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:01,185
as a Marxist...

88
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:03,865
who fights exploiters...

89
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:07,623
how could I work for
and aid the exploiters?

90
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:15,329
Do you remember, Pa, when we were
sleeping here from 1941 to 1945?

91
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:16,309
Of course...

92
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:20,610
Here were the cows,
and we slept over there.

93
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,036
That means...

94
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:27,413
we were sharing fifty-fifty,
we and the cows.

95
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,715
Do you remember how I left

96
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:35,202
this stable in 1946,
to learn a craft?

97
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:38,904
Do you remember how I got approval
from the Ministry of Defence?

98
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:41,073
To go to a military-industrial school?

99
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:42,309
Yes...

100
00:06:42,482 --> 00:06:43,385
Yes...

101
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:44,317
Do you know...

102
00:06:44,347 --> 00:06:49,844
Do you remember when you crushed
my head against that wall,

103
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:53,042
because I went to the partisans?
You must remember!

104
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:55,612
He wasn't even fifteen years old yet.

105
00:06:55,642 --> 00:06:59,950
And I already had one son who
had joined the partisans.

106
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:01,826
That's why...

107
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:04,638
I had to...

108
00:07:05,878 --> 00:07:09,139
Everyone was naked, barefoot...

109
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:13,689
I was searching...
To earn some money...

110
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:14,787
But you see...

111
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:18,336
He also never made any money...

112
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:20,262
What now...?

113
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:24,978
I came from a village,
probably looking like a bum

114
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:28,266
who barely knew how to write.

115
00:07:28,296 --> 00:07:32,191
Here I received my first baptisms.

116
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:35,987
My first introduction to civilisation.

117
00:07:36,745 --> 00:07:38,779
Here they poured

118
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:40,231
so much into my head...

119
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:42,638
Almost like with a funnel.

120
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:45,059
So, I retained everything

121
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,461
and it remained in my head.

122
00:07:47,491 --> 00:07:49,669
Stuck as a fly to a glue trap.

123
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:51,749
Marxism, socialism...

124
00:07:51,915 --> 00:07:52,961
Theoretically...

125
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,388
And it seems to me

126
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:59,254
they put in my head...
the entire communist society.

127
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,693
While learning my craft,

128
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:04,365
I was being poisoned
for three years.

129
00:08:04,395 --> 00:08:05,959
Poured, poured into my head...

130
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:09,740
Then another three years,
in the Yugoslav People's Army.

131
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,228
Then, for two years, I was pouring it
into the head of another man.

132
00:08:14,413 --> 00:08:18,321
Then, I was chief of a communist youth
organization, for a year...

133
00:08:21,494 --> 00:08:26,002
This is how one ends up
who doesn't have Marxism on his mind!

134
00:08:26,494 --> 00:08:30,185
Here I was, correctly explicating
the party line of Marxism

135
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:31,946
and government.

136
00:08:33,257 --> 00:08:36,500
Although I was a good worker,
a good repairman,

137
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,716
I realised that it wasn't worth it.

138
00:08:38,746 --> 00:08:44,597
I realised what it's all about and what
they want to do with an honest man.

139
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:48,018
Just when I think about them...

140
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:54,595
Almost every day, I think about
suing the state for discrimination,

141
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:59,249
for discrepancy between education
and later practice in production.

142
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:41,076
Marxism is... Leninism

143
00:09:41,106 --> 00:09:45,149
of the period of imperialism
and workers' revolution.

144
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:47,387
The workers' class...

145
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:48,588
of the world,

146
00:09:48,618 --> 00:09:52,683
together with Marx, has expelled God
from human society

147
00:09:52,713 --> 00:09:56,485
and in that way has become
the gravedigger of capitalism.

148
00:09:56,515 --> 00:10:00,203
Which means that Marxism is
the fucker of capitalism!

149
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:30,115
I'm a Marxist fanatic.
Which means...

150
00:10:30,623 --> 00:10:34,498
I'm excessively interested in it.

151
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:39,838
But... I don't want...
Namely, I don't regret...

152
00:10:40,826 --> 00:10:45,369
being this way
because it's my pride and glory

153
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,865
and I would give my life for it!

154
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:53,828
I'm a blind practitioner of Marxism

155
00:10:53,858 --> 00:10:57,594
and this is my honour
as a Yugoslav metalworker!

156
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,623
Unemployed for four years,

157
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:19,454
I spend my time here

158
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:22,554
at the railway and bus station.

159
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:24,791
I get warmed up...

160
00:11:25,445 --> 00:11:27,818
And I follow... the motion.

161
00:11:27,848 --> 00:11:32,192
If someone's hand creeps
into someone else's pocket...

162
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:36,599
I stop him, I catch him, et cetera.

163
00:11:37,553 --> 00:11:38,812
Because...

164
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:42,257
I've been to 150 factories,
where I've seen people work hard

165
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:43,889
to make a living.

166
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,201
And they need to be
protected by someone.

167
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,991
So I...

168
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:51,966
found myself doing this

169
00:11:52,124 --> 00:11:55,190
following the appeal
of the Federal Secretary

170
00:11:56,346 --> 00:11:57,985
in 1967.

171
00:11:58,015 --> 00:12:00,480
I joined the fight
against societal evil,

172
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:03,768
did my civic duty
in accordance with the law,

173
00:12:03,798 --> 00:12:07,743
and plus...
spontaneously helped the government.

174
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:09,619
But...

175
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:15,955
I get a lot of interference in all this
from the police!

176
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:29,977
Now I'm doing "KOLT 15 GAP",
which stands for:

177
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:35,030
"Collect waste, lick dishes,
15 years, actively or passively."

178
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,649
It means exactly that
in five different languages.

179
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:43,916
I do this because I've been without a job
for 4 and a half years, namely 5 years.

180
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:47,869
Tried to work as a carrier,
they wouldn't let me.

181
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:49,893
I cannot work in a coal mine.

182
00:12:49,923 --> 00:12:53,561
And I cannot become a criminal
because I have on my mind:

183
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:56,844
Marx, Engels, Lenin,
Tito and Che Guevara.

184
00:12:57,995 --> 00:13:04,634
For 20 years, 95 percent of the time
I didn't have anywhere to sleep.

185
00:13:04,824 --> 00:13:11,512
Working or not working,
it was always the same.

186
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:21,405
During my trial work in 180 factories,
in Yugoslavia and nine other countries,

187
00:13:21,921 --> 00:13:23,125
I had to sleep

188
00:13:23,155 --> 00:13:32,447
at railway stations, in waggons, parks,
on benches, or in the best case

189
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:41,582
in worker's barracks, elevators, on
doormats, in phone booths,

190
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:45,700
basements and public toilets.

191
00:13:46,104 --> 00:13:48,984
I propose to the state
and the state organs

192
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:54,743
to erase me from the registration list
for ID card and place of residence,

193
00:13:54,773 --> 00:13:59,552
and everything else that my
consciousness has overcome.

194
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:02,604
I'm ashamed when I hear
about official documents.

195
00:14:02,661 --> 00:14:09,399
I can live without state, police,
courts, jails, and army.

196
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:11,815
To me, all of that is dead...

197
00:14:14,057 --> 00:14:20,453
If I were president,
I would abolish parliament,

198
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:24,234
I would abolish the federation
and the republic,

199
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,117
I would leave the state
on a municipal level,

200
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,130
I would build gallows
in the periphery of every town...

201
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:34,739
Every town would have gallows...

202
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:38,256
and if someone steals, he'll be hanged.

203
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:42,113
I would also build
a public speaking platform,

204
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:47,331
so 20 million Yugoslavs could
say what they think.

205
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,358
Certainly...

206
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:53,372
20 million know better
than 200 politicians,

207
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:55,997
and we wouldn't need
stabilisation of society.

208
00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:58,747
I would leave the police
on a municipal level,

209
00:14:58,777 --> 00:15:00,903
cut the army in half,

210
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,445
and from their budgets,
all municipalities

211
00:15:04,475 --> 00:15:08,493
would send some percentage
to army headquarters...

212
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:12,613
that would continue
to function and to protect

213
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:14,317
the state from

214
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:15,900
foreigners...

215
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,123
Doing all that,

216
00:15:18,153 --> 00:15:21,338
abolishing the federation
and the republic,

217
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:25,559
means I would abolish myself in the end.

218
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,840
- I'm Cebic.
- Speak...

219
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,200
- How long have you worked here?
- 10 years.

220
00:15:36,254 --> 00:15:39,480
- Ask him directly!
- What is your profession?

221
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,680
I'm an unqualified worker,
metalworker.

222
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,160
Is there any work for me here?
I'm a metalworker too.

223
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,720
I don't know...

224
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,520
You'd have to talk to human resources...

225
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,120
Have you heard of Marx?

226
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,400
- Marx and Engels?
- Yes.

227
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:06,160
Do you think that socialism
can be built without knowing Marx?

228
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,755
Well now... It's hard to tell...

229
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,316
- So, you don't know Marx very well?
- Not really...

230
00:16:14,603 --> 00:16:16,765
- But you've heard of him?
- Yes.

231
00:16:16,795 --> 00:16:20,000
Would you like to answer some questions?

232
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,200
I would like to
but a car is waiting for me...

233
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,800
Ask him about Marx!

234
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,520
- Have you heard of Marx?
- Yes.

235
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,410
Who is he?

236
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,382
Please, I told you that a car is waiting
and I don't have time...

237
00:16:31,563 --> 00:16:33,960
Who is Marx?
Can you tell us about him?

238
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,000
If you've heard of him...
I'm also a metalworker...

239
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,561
I'm sorry, but I can't now...
As you've heard, I'm on my way home...

240
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,160
Okay, fine then...

241
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,120
- Are you a metalworker here?
- Yes.

242
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,760
Can you tell how long
you have worked here?

243
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:55,942
- Twenty years.
- Twenty years?

244
00:16:55,972 --> 00:16:56,956
Yes.

245
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,160
Are you satisfied with your salary?

246
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,120
- Now?
- Now.

247
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:05,690
I'm the director,
so it doesn't matter...

248
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,080
Okay, thank you.

249
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,828
Ask him about Marx!
Ask him about Marx!

250
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:11,706
He said he's the director.

251
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,490
Have you worked here
for a long time?

252
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,800
- Twelve years.
- Twelve years.

253
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,480
Are you satisfied with your salary?

254
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,600
- I don't want to talk about that.
- I'm a metalworker too.

255
00:17:22,827 --> 00:17:25,400
Thank you. Have you heard of Marx?
- What?

256
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,890
- Have you heard of Marx?
- Marx?

257
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,560
I'm a metalworker just like you
but currently unemployed.

258
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,232
- Have you heard of Marx?
- Don't ask me...

259
00:17:37,262 --> 00:17:40,680
Speak freely. I'm also worker
but currently unemployed.

260
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,107
- Have you heard of Marx?
- Yes, but don't ask me...

261
00:17:44,137 --> 00:17:45,520
There are others...

262
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,000
So, he is forbidden to speak...

263
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,430
Ask a worker, Cebo.

264
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,038
Excuse me, brother...

265
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,960
Would you like to answer some questions?

266
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,640
- If you're a metalworker?
- No, I'm not...

267
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,120
- Are you a metalworker?
- Why?

268
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,000
- Are you a factory worker?
- Yes, why?

269
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,800
Could you answer some questions?
I'm also worker but unemployed...

270
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,680
- Have you heard of Marx?
- Yes.

271
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,680
So, you know about Marxism...

272
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,520
And who is Marx? Could you explain?

273
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,840
I'll be late for the bus...

274
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,120
So you're in a hurry.
But it's not hard to say a few words...

275
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,120
- It's not hard but I have to go.
- Okay, fine. Cheers!

276
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,600
Have you worked here
for a long time?

277
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,840
- Ten years.
- Ten years.

278
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,120
Are you satisfied with your salary?
How much is it?

279
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,370
Well, the salary is basic...

280
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,680
I'm not qualified,
so 65 thousand... 66...

281
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,680
And are you satisfied with that salary?

282
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,449
- Well...
- He's overly satisfied!

283
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,920
I'm a worker too...

284
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,080
- It's a low salary!
- I'm a worker too, unemployed...

285
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,240
Speak your mind freely...

286
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,640
For example. You've heard of Marx.
Do you know who he is?

287
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,840
- I wouldn't know...
- No...

288
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,240
Okay, cheers!

289
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,640
I'm from a village. I wouldn't know...

290
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,520
- Industrial worker for 25 years...
- 25 years...

291
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,320
and your salary is 60 thousand?

292
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,520
Yes, but I do some extra work
and I get bonuses.

293
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,376
How much, for example,
with bonuses?

294
00:19:31,406 --> 00:19:35,960
- About 90 thousand, 100...
- Okay, fine. Cheers!

295
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:46,080
Could you answer some questions?
I'm a metalworker too but unemployed.

296
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,720
Him, him, him!
Ask him!

297
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:51,920
Brother, I'm a metalworker,
maybe you are too?

298
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,640
Can you tell me...
Are you satisfied with your salary?

299
00:19:57,749 --> 00:19:58,530
So-so...

300
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,146
- What? - So, so.
- It means: not really...

301
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:05,280
- And have you heard of Marx?
- Yes.

302
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,120
Who was he?

303
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,240
- Go, Macedonian, go!
- Go to hell!

304
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,960
Hm...

305
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,520
You mean... - I mean in a few sentences.
Who was he?

306
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,560
He was a famous Russian...

307
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,587
Who was...
We also act by him...

308
00:20:26,617 --> 00:20:27,509
A-ha...

309
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,600
You want to say that he was a teacher
of the working class?

310
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:40,560
- Of the working class of all the nations.
- Yes, of the world's working class.

311
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,880
- Have you heard of Marx?
- What?

312
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,459
Have you heard of Marx?

313
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:46,186
But of course. In school.

314
00:20:46,216 --> 00:20:47,574
Who was he?

315
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,360
He was...

316
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,600
He was...

317
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,160
How to say it...

318
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,520
He was a man who...

319
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,120
Man from the top!

320
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,880
- The man who invented socialism?
- Yes, yes. Socialism.

321
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:12,320
He's the father of the working class,
who wrote Marx's <i>The Capital</i>.

322
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,523
Who wrote a scientific thesis
of a socialist concept.

323
00:21:17,553 --> 00:21:20,097
Okay, thank you, cheers!

324
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,320
- Have you heard of Marx?
- Yes.

325
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,600
Who was Marx?

326
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,280
How to answer this...
It's a stupid question...

327
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,040
Marx was...
Have you heard of him?

328
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,120
Yes... Marx, Engels...

329
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,040
And who was he?

330
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:44,080
He was a Russian...
Scientist...

331
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,160
And which science?

332
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,880
He was a great man. Politician.

333
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,280
Okay, thanks, fellow.
What's your salary?

334
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,578
- I earn 118 thousand.
- Are you satisfied with that?

335
00:22:00,608 --> 00:22:03,195
- No.
- What are you doing here?

336
00:22:03,225 --> 00:22:07,520
What do you want here?
Are you crazy?

337
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,660
You cannot film here!

338
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,440
You need a permit!

339
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:28,513
A thousand times in this odyssey
of a life of mine, I thought

340
00:22:28,718 --> 00:22:33,601
about grabbing a submachine gun
and climbing up a pole at Terazije...

341
00:22:34,624 --> 00:22:37,413
That is to say - if I was ready to die...

342
00:22:38,343 --> 00:22:45,830
And then I would say everything
that has been in my heart for 20 years...

343
00:22:46,508 --> 00:22:50,905
in my honest, noble and humane life,

344
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:55,694
because as a Marxist,
I'm a humanist above all...

345
00:22:55,724 --> 00:23:03,850
Six years ago, I was in Valjevo,
at the social welfare office,

346
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:09,495
asking for minimal help,
as an unemployed person,

347
00:23:09,525 --> 00:23:16,633
and they knew me as a longtime worker
who travels and often changes jobs,

348
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:19,478
and only demands what he is entitled to.

349
00:23:19,508 --> 00:23:23,343
So they decided to bring in a psychiatrist.

350
00:23:23,373 --> 00:23:26,958
They probably assumed I was smart.

351
00:23:27,402 --> 00:23:32,879
The psychiatrist performed a detailed
examination and said to the official...

352
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:43,241
that I was smarter than the official, the
psychiatrist, and the one who'd sent me.

353
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,913
He said: "Tell the one who sent you
to go fuck himself!"

354
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:51,522
"Because..."

355
00:23:52,303 --> 00:23:53,342
"Say..."

356
00:23:53,944 --> 00:23:59,306
"that the smart one told the smart ones
that the smart one is smart."

357
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:06,654
So I left the examination,
and I left Valjevo,

358
00:24:06,684 --> 00:24:11,040
and stayed in Belgrade as a smart one,
to continue my search for a job...
