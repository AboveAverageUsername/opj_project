Let's hope your cue to move.

00:02:46,017 --> 00:02:48,140
This wait is killing me.

45
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:11,222
Do not have a bath in a week.

00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:04,272
And it has to be discussed.

58
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:08,991
This morning, three men tried to escape.

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,016
A 2 of them we boiled to death.

00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:16,993
Someone help this man out.

61
00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:20,453
I want to know ...

62
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,973
by whom ...

63
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:43,184
Sending the northern tolerar ...

64
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:46,688
this type of behavior in my guard.

65
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,008
Next time I will not be so merciful.

66
00:04:53,508 --> 00:04:55,407
Do not even hesitate!

67
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:58,083
There will be no escape!

68
00:05:00,252 --> 00:05:02,216
I copied. Out.

69
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,529
McConkie is giving orders to prepare.

70
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:06,548
- Fire when ready. - Preparations.

71
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,449
- Clear. - Ongoing.

72
00:05:58,837 --> 00:05:59,928
Sargento Atwood.

73
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:02,860
McConkie want to see you and Whitaker quickly.

74
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:05,026
隆Max!

75
00:06:13,771 --> 00:06:16,697
- Is it really bad or not? - Although you can achieve.

76
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,315
I bet it will be so fast that I will Pocotello.

77
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:23,717
Or you can exchange it for a new one.

78
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:27,879
Those are fighting words.

79
00:06:29,071 --> 00:06:30,973
Do not ever talk about her.

80
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:33,093
What? Think you can with me, Daddy?

81
00:06:33,407 --> 00:06:36,343
Any day of the week and twice on Sundays.

82
00:06:36,378 --> 00:06:37,134
驴Ah, si?

83
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:38,295
Sure you can grandfather.

84
00:06:39,657 --> 00:06:41,379
You failed. What do you think?

85
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:45,746
Look at that.

86
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,771
I have a Nelson in Nelson.

87
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:48,806
Sorry.

88
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:50,243
Do not apologize to me, ...

89
00:06:50,278 --> 00:06:52,974
- Apologize to the girl. - Sorry, lady

90
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:53,950
- She's a lady.

91
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:56,218
I'm sorry, ma'am. It was very rude of me,

92
00:06:56,253 --> 00:06:57,752
and will not happen again.

93
00:06:58,627 --> 00:06:59,696
Cut it already.

94
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:02,303
No more fights. We have to keep moving.

95
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,191
Agree, disagree.

96
00:07:04,385 --> 00:07:07,303
Do not mess with the Ramrod, Ping Pong.

97
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:09,703
It's good advice.

98
00:07:23,147 --> 00:07:24,670
Atwood, Whitaker.

99
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:27,881
I need to make a quick attack Braunlage.

100
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,837
Atwood. You'll be a sergeant in it.

101
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:33,372
The other companies are having a little problem ...

102
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:35,367
with some stubborn Germans east of town.

103
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,300
They can not do that ...

104
00:07:37,932 --> 00:07:38,932
Is the Mayor?

105
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:41,634
- 驴Brugermeister? - Si, ese ...

106
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,915
to convince them that the war was almost over.

107
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,437
Yes. He tried, but he was killed.

108
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:46,890
It's just a small resistance ...

109
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,615
that somehow went unnoticed.

110
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,089
What sugieroes entering there and a little scared.

111
00:07:51,124 --> 00:07:53,528
Want to relocate inventory or more soldiers, sir?

112
00:07:53,563 --> 00:07:55,863
No. The two groups already have are enough.

113
00:07:56,298 --> 00:08:00,512
We'll do it quickly.

114
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:00,578
Captain, I need a man in the group of artillery.

115
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:03,805
The wizard lost his shooting hand on the bridge in the morning,

116
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,441
Sharon lo Matar贸.

117
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:09,050
- Do you have some replacements? No. Hold on to what they have.

118
00:08:09,085 --> 00:08:10,189
And what about Nelson?

119
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:14,348
Has experience. We can promote it and boot it in your group.

120
00:08:14,623 --> 00:08:16,162
It is a good solution. Let's go with that.

121
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:18,452
With Hitler dead and the Russians take Berlin ...

122
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:20,548
maybe this is the last action you see.

123
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,095
All this will be over within a week. Remember me.

124
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,607
I do not want anyone to die today, so follow the rules.

125
00:08:25,642 --> 00:08:26,389
Yes, sir.

126
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:29,872
And General Irelan come today. So I want you back ...

127
00:08:29,907 --> 00:08:31,111
for the visit of General.

128
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:33,214
We will deal with the matter in Braunlage and will be back.

129
00:08:33,249 --> 00:08:35,239
Excellent. Thanks gentlemen, stand down.

130
00:08:35,274 --> 00:08:36,274
Lord.

131
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:38,172
- Atwood.
- Si, se帽or.

132
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:41,298
Tell Simms was a good shot the last night.

133
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,389
With guards at 260 yards, must be a record.

134
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,785
I'll let you satisfied.

135
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:55,192
驴"Avenging angel"?

136
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:57,975
Hey, what do you do?

137
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,185
Hey, Simms...

138
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,739
I like it. It's a good name.

139
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:01,528
隆Simms...!

140
00:09:01,563 --> 00:09:03,697
I saw one the other day, and I'll laugh. these guys ...

141
00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:04,732
Oye!

142
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:08,023
Why do not you go to work?

143
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:10,569
Driving lorries, polish boots ... I do not care.

144
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:13,068
Just stay away from my Helkath.

145
00:09:17,326 --> 00:09:19,267
Understand, you are not welcome here.

146
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,282
Are you deaf?

147
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,307
You, pi茅rdete.

148
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,862
This cable is not striving to simpatizarte.

149
00:09:42,897 --> 00:09:44,806
Yes, ... it's all a great guy.

150
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,895
Do you think I came to fight against racist damn world?

151
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,657
When we have these problems in the US

152
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,706
It's called irony ...

153
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:57,615
or hypocrisy. Depending on which side of the line you are.

154
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:01,980
I do not like these types racist drunk.

155
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:03,980
That was when we left ...

156
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:06,429
Cuando as铆 will we turn.

157
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:12,933
Someone told me you used to drive one of those tanks.

158
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:15,370
You heard wrong.

159
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:17,932
My group was not tank, tank destroyer was.

160
00:10:18,822 --> 00:10:21,136
I was commander of one of those Helkath for two years.

161
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:24,769
Then you have good stories to tell.

162
00:10:25,482 --> 00:10:27,179
A good ...

163
00:10:27,608 --> 00:10:30,480
and others that were not so good after all.

164
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,922
And how did you get to drive trucks?

165
00:10:35,349 --> 00:10:38,079
They degraded the service unit three weeks ago.

166
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:40,467
The general said, and I quote:

167
00:10:40,502 --> 00:10:43,894
"If this battalion were a horse, shoot him."

168
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:46,230
It's a long story.

169
00:10:46,265 --> 00:10:47,065
隆Owen!

170
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:48,106
Owen! Come here.

171
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:50,480
I'm all ears.

172
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,739
Another time. Let's load these trucks and move.

173
00:10:56,774 --> 00:10:57,774
Agreed.

174
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:02,135
Welcome gentlemen to express Owens.

175
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,213
Watch your head.

176
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:05,887
Our next stop,

177
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:10,502
hot baths, beds and good food.

178
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:17,244
- Good Morning. - Where did you get that?

179
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:18,708
Lo Tome por AHI.

180
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,762
I had to make something for my brother and thus prove I was here.

181
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:23,907
You know I'll never let you take it home.

182
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,498
Never say Never.

183
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:27,905
Did you find more treasure?

184
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,509
Behind the graves.

185
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:32,119
They excarvaron and left all these things before you leave here.

186
00:11:32,154 --> 00:11:33,862
Speaking of treasures ...

187
00:11:34,314 --> 00:11:37,817
I have some novels you love, but want your cigarillos.

188
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,682
Here they are.

189
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,003
Are you serious?

190
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,570
Is that a fair exchange?

191
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,387
No smoke, but read. What is the problem?

192
00:11:48,422 --> 00:11:50,135
Have you heard of the robbery on the highway?

193
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,913
All that crap you have a package worth just there.

194
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:54,434
These are hard to find.

195
00:11:54,469 --> 00:11:56,409
All right. What will I do with cigarettes?

196
00:11:56,444 --> 00:11:58,302
See? Everything is arranged.

197
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,430
- Thank you, Danny boy. - Do not call me.

198
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:05,526
- That's your nickname. - I do not want a nickname.

199
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:08,880
Everyone has a nickname. The Nelson's "Ping Pong".

200
00:12:08,915 --> 00:12:11,569
- Simms is "Judy" ... - Wait ... 驴"Judy"?

201
00:12:12,494 --> 00:12:14,451
Yes. Your first name is Cary.

202
00:12:16,076 --> 00:12:17,794
驴Cary Grant?

203
00:12:18,286 --> 00:12:19,916
Sorry. I do not understand.

204
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:22,696
Judy, Judy, Judy.

205
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:25,325
He said, "Bring me a baby."

206
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,614
No, no, no, no, no...

207
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:29,911
You mistook Larry Storge, comedian.

208
00:12:29,946 --> 00:12:33,482
He made a representation of Cary Grant Judy on stage.

209
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:38,351
"Susan, Susan, Susan". That said Cary Grant in "Get me a baby."

210
00:12:38,386 --> 00:12:39,058
Exactly.

211
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:39,695
Thank you.

212
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,032
Good. I have no problem calling him "Susan".

213
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:43,805
Ping Pong.

214
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:47,525
You were promoted to be a charger to replace Kelly.

215
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:50,100
Now you will work with the trigger, right?

216
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:51,548
Not a problem, Sgt.

217
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:54,541
We will teach you how a real group shot.

218
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:55,425
驴Ah, si?

219
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,763
Do that, Max. OK?

220
00:12:58,408 --> 00:13:01,546
Attention all. McConkie needs its ready to Braunlag Helcats.

221
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:02,683
驴Braunlag?

222
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:05,442
If it says "Braunlage".

223
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:07,496
"Braunlage".

224
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:09,121
Are you done?

225
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:11,127
Do not fight the German language.

226
00:13:11,162 --> 00:13:12,338
Or against people.

227
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:14,327
We fought against the Nazis.

228
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:16,476
Then, ...

229
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,728
have to persuade the Germans that come out with their hands up.

230
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:22,106
We have much work to do, so we charge.

231
00:13:28,398 --> 00:13:29,398
Mitchell.

232
00:13:29,422 --> 00:13:32,012
I need two more rounds of missiles for the wearer.

233
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:33,047
You have them.

234
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,011
隆Danny!

235
00:13:38,046 --> 00:13:39,102
隆B谩jate!

236
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,167
Want to open a hole for fun?

237
00:13:45,202 --> 00:13:45,753
No.

238
00:13:45,788 --> 00:13:46,890
Why would I want to do that?

239
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,213
Because you're a ball!

240
00:13:48,248 --> 00:13:49,921
Ayer te dije.

241
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:52,952
Do not smoke near the ammunition.

242
00:13:52,987 --> 00:13:55,685
- I know. Sorry. I forget. - You forget?

243
00:13:56,024 --> 00:13:57,024
You forget ...

244
00:13:57,027 --> 00:13:59,525
How could you forget! You're the charger.

245
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,308
You drive more than anyone on this team armory.

246
00:14:01,343 --> 00:14:02,699
Do not know why I forgot ...

247
00:14:02,734 --> 00:14:03,734
Remember that.

248
00:14:03,745 --> 00:14:06,446
Or send us all to hell along with you.

249
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:08,263
- Got it? - Yes, Sergeant.

250
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:12,253
Sometimes I wonder what happens to you.

251
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,832
You do not have to ask more, it has been confirmed.

252
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:18,900
The results of Barlow negative IQ arrived this morning.

253
00:14:19,688 --> 00:14:21,543
Here you go, Danny boy.

254
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:48,275
Sorry for the delay, gentlemen. But finally out of here.

255
00:14:51,643 --> 00:14:52,918
Lieutenant.

256
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:54,950
Do you feel good?

257
00:14:55,857 --> 00:14:57,048
I'm fine.

258
00:14:57,756 --> 00:14:59,597
Just a little tired.

259
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,090
Then, ...

260
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,198
What happened up there?

261
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:05,272
What made Shonbeck?

262
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:06,783
Good ...

263
00:15:06,977 --> 00:15:08,543
It's a long story.

264
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:13,015
I do not know where it came from, but we caught past the farm.

265
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,948
Shonbeck nos llev贸 al bosque.

266
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,054
And we were confident that we would be killed.

267
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:38,220
Teniente Goss.

268
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,978
12 kilometers is very far.

269
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:45,415
I'm surprised he has not gone before.

270
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:50,149
His enemies uniforms had to help, that I admit.

271
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:53,793
Can we walk, gentlemen?

272
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:57,624
Summer, ...

273
00:15:57,648 --> 00:16:02,458
The dilemma is that we left here to shoot any soldier ...

274
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:04,488
to view enemy uniform.

275
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:05,717
Stop here.

276
00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:08,953
Turn around.

277
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,558
Knees.

278
00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:20,213
My favorite weapon.

279
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:25,398
My father took a British officer who killed later.

280
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:29,552
It is much better than the 9mm Lugger.

281
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,723
Do you know why ...

282
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:36,581
British arms changed to standard 4.55?

283
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:43,858
Did you know, Lieutenant?

284
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,536
You're British.

285
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,539
You should know.

286
00:16:53,196 --> 00:16:54,196
驴No?

287
00:16:56,794 --> 00:16:58,404
Me neither.

288
00:16:59,244 --> 00:17:03,882
Just seems easier to handle.

289
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:07,638
It's a waste.

290
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:15,679
There is a game we used to play on the Russian front.

291
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,385
Who is the last man left ...

292
00:17:19,423 --> 00:17:20,564
Good.

293
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:24,681
You can go to the forest, or wherever.

294
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:30,948
Looks like a generous offer considering the severity of his crime.

295
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:35,137
It's very simple.

296
00:17:35,642 --> 00:17:37,827
Just point the gun at his temple.

297
00:17:37,862 --> 00:17:39,523
Pull the trigger, ...

298
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,253
and then, of course, if you are still alive ...

299
00:17:43,912 --> 00:17:45,478
They spend.

300
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:53,869
Let's go.

301
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:55,372
Take it!

302
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:02,996
I do not want to be the one chosen. That would be very unfair.

303
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,731
It's simple.

304
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:19,601
Now, if you do not want to consider my offer ...

305
00:18:19,914 --> 00:18:25,149
I can kill all the a trip or push them until they do.

306
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:33,547
Very well.

307
00:19:29,424 --> 00:19:31,272
Well, Mitchell. Move us.

308
00:19:36,348 --> 00:19:37,754
Mitchell, vamos andando.

309
00:19:39,868 --> 00:19:41,047
Say prayer.

310
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:46,819
- Amen, Sergeant! - Amen.

311
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,932
What is happening?

312
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:32,310
Last night the Germans blew up the bridge.

313
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:33,521
They flew around the area.

314
00:20:33,556 --> 00:20:35,839
They have engineers working on repairs.

315
00:20:35,874 --> 00:20:37,342
And the rest of the convoy?

316
00:20:37,377 --> 00:20:40,170
We let them take risks, but the last to cross ...

317
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:43,001
got caught between the bridge and the river.

318
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:44,675
Luckily no one died.

319
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,476
It will take all day to repair that bridge.

320
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,890
So what do we do?

321
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,713
You have to take the 520. That is why Saint Andreasberg.

322
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:53,427
It has a small bridge where you can cross.

323
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,193
And how far is that?

324
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:57,225
About 20 miles. It's like an hour.

325
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,082
You better wait here. But they do not know how to wait.

326
00:21:00,705 --> 00:21:01,794
Thank you.

327
00:21:02,837 --> 00:21:04,121
Hey, what's wrong?

328
00:21:04,156 --> 00:21:06,449
We have to take an alternative path for Saint Andreasberg.

329
00:21:06,484 --> 00:21:08,398
So we get to "emptiness" and go.

330
00:21:09,673 --> 00:21:12,912
Sorry, gentlemen. We were told that the bridge is broken.

331
00:21:12,947 --> 00:21:15,491
So we have to divert another way.

332
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:18,035
I do not mind the trip. It is actually pleasant.

333
00:21:18,546 --> 00:21:20,759
But here we have a guy on the other hand, it ...

334
00:21:20,794 --> 00:21:22,713
I'm not sure who likes shortcuts.

335
00:21:23,761 --> 00:21:25,998
You can go in the cabin if you want, sir.

336
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:35,773
I'm Lieutenant Goss.

337
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:39,493
Sergeant Jesse Owens. A pleasure to meet you, Lieutenant.

338
00:21:39,528 --> 00:21:41,167
Jesse Owens,...

339
00:21:41,553 --> 00:21:44,393
How Olympic medalist Jesse Owens?

340
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,460
Exactly.

341
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:48,995
Must be nice to confuse you with him, I guess.

342
00:21:49,293 --> 00:21:51,927
- Looks like a good guy. - Do you think?

343
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:55,395
- The man won 3 gold medals. - 4 medals, sir.

344
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,492
Four?

345
00:21:56,841 --> 00:22:01,267
It broke a world record. I did seem to others as fools.

346
00:22:02,983 --> 00:22:04,303
I can be liked.

347
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:06,276
隆Going!

348
00:22:26,923 --> 00:22:28,811
Danny boy, do you have gum?

349
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:33,574
- Not if you're gonna call it. - I told you, it's your nickname.

350
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:35,781
I told you not want a nickname.

351
00:22:35,816 --> 00:22:39,302
Cut it! That's your nickname. You know, like the song:

352
00:22:39,337 --> 00:22:42,022
"Oh, Danny boy,..."

353
00:22:57,203 --> 00:22:59,311
That's an Irish song.

354
00:23:06,373 --> 00:23:09,789
I'm not Irish, nor my ancestors.

355
00:23:10,546 --> 00:23:12,446
Come r谩jate with gum.

356
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:19,933
Thank you.

357
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,967
Do you feel better, sir?

358
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:47,278
Now I can see where we go, much better.

359
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:50,503
Well, as you can see let me give tourism.

360
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:54,796
Welcome to "Empty". Killing 1,000 miles.

361
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:57,824
After our troops crossed the line,

362
00:23:57,859 --> 00:24:01,283
they moved like 15 millaspor day. These are the remains.

363
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:06,391
We can go home and the people of this country gets to see this.

364
00:24:07,182 --> 00:24:09,089
Like driving trucks?

365
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,014
As they say, it's better than being in the back of the bus.

366
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:17,326
Sorry. I'm not familiar with that term.

367
00:24:19,088 --> 00:24:22,801
It's what the bus drivers told us in America.

368
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,195
Blacks had to be at the end of the bus,

369
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,257
even if it were empty.

370
00:24:28,491 --> 00:24:29,970
What kind of behavior is that?

371
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:31,842
In me it seems fair.

372
00:24:34,358 --> 00:24:36,114
That I say, sir.

373
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,422
What happened there later?

374
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,537
Back off!

375
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:13,535
隆Let's go!

376
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:23,048
隆Vamos, walking!

377
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:43,017
Take this route to Saint Andreasberg

378
00:25:43,052 --> 00:25:48,611
and then turn right, along this road.

379
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:50,832
Agreed.

380
00:25:51,023 --> 00:25:52,023
Is that clear?

381
00:25:54,142 --> 00:25:56,122
Simms, will you go home?

382
00:25:56,157 --> 00:25:57,772
You know what I love most?

383
00:25:57,999 --> 00:26:00,105
A good pair of pajamas.

384
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:03,322
It would be nice not to have to sleep with the uniform.

385
00:26:03,357 --> 00:26:06,041
Now, that sounds good. I worry about women.

386
00:26:06,076 --> 00:26:10,402
Say or do something wrong, I know. I forgot how to use a glass ...

387
00:26:10,437 --> 00:26:12,706
I begin to drink milk from the bottle or something.

388
00:26:12,741 --> 00:26:17,340
What you have to remember is that when you get back are some ladies.

389
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,909
He likes these French trinkets.

390
00:26:19,944 --> 00:26:23,278
Do not go walking towards them and ask "How much?"

391
00:26:23,313 --> 00:26:25,232
Try saying something like ...

392
00:26:25,267 --> 00:26:27,412
"Nice day, is not it?".

393
00:26:27,447 --> 00:26:32,676
Or "Excuse me but have you ever seen the Eiffel Tower?".

394
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:35,865
Yes. Then you can ask him, "How much?".

395
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,939
Is that you?

396
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:47,299
- Smelly walk, and no kidding. - Are the portions K.

397
00:26:47,334 --> 00:26:49,624
Then do not eat the rations K.

398
00:26:50,086 --> 00:26:52,562
Come C rations are safer.

399
00:26:52,597 --> 00:26:54,697
I do not like the taste of meat in those things.

400
00:26:54,732 --> 00:26:56,798
The K rations come with chocolate bars

401
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:58,507
They are cheaper and elusive.

402
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:00,983
- Maybe it's what makes me. - Then do not eat it.

403
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:04,465
Maybe it's the bars D.

404
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,754
You've also eaten the bars D?

405
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:11,081
- I know that smell well. - I like sweets.

406
00:27:11,116 --> 00:27:13,947
Well, but do you know what? No smell sweet.

407
00:27:13,982 --> 00:27:17,761
You better get your sack arrimas farts and sleep tonight.

408
00:27:17,796 --> 00:27:19,979
Not more servings K ...

409
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:22,163
And no more bars D!

410
00:27:24,489 --> 00:27:26,331
- He's right. - Yes?

411
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,865
So have the end of my finger.

412
00:27:30,354 --> 00:27:31,728
Removes insurance.

413
00:27:36,346 --> 00:27:37,507
隆Barlow!

414
00:27:39,593 --> 00:27:42,027
The Helcats weigh about 35,000 pounds.

415
00:27:42,574 --> 00:27:44,262
Sure you can cross out there.

416
00:27:44,297 --> 00:27:46,920
That way baby will all Helcats.

417
00:27:46,955 --> 00:27:48,485
Agreed. Thank you.

418
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,835
Well, Max. Can I sell you a bottle of drink?

419
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,870
You sure.

420
00:27:57,325 --> 00:27:59,227
- Are 25 cents. - What?

421
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:02,446
- Are 10 cents in the CP. - Out here ...

422
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:04,207
Are 25 cents.

423
00:28:31,052 --> 00:28:32,915
Do not think they're following us.

424
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:36,721
Jesse,...

425
00:28:40,956 --> 00:28:44,110
- To the east there is, right? - Yes.

426
00:28:45,635 --> 00:28:47,923
- Then we go around ... - Yes.

427
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,212
We removed the main road.

428
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:54,528
驴Cua is the situation?

429
00:28:54,972 --> 00:29:00,921
The trace of a mile but escaped.

430
00:29:03,371 --> 00:29:06,538
Go and check the grinder.

431
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,733
Okay, guys. Listen!

432
00:29:13,647 --> 00:29:15,522
Let's take an alternate route.

433
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:16,216
So ...

434
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:18,646
Vamos a la 520 por Saint Andreasber.

435
00:29:18,681 --> 00:29:20,595
隆Saint Andreasberg!

436
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,849
You're not going to leave you alone. Right, Max?

437
00:29:25,176 --> 00:29:29,618
By Saint Andreasberg, then we'll cross the river.

438
00:29:51,152 --> 00:29:52,350
Lieutenant ...

439
00:29:52,636 --> 00:29:53,820
Come look at this.

440
00:30:15,912 --> 00:30:17,665
Let us go up to the tower.

441
00:30:18,047 --> 00:30:20,227
Let's see where we are. Okay?

442
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:21,558
Yes.

443
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:23,669
Depart.

444
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,957
Come on. Stop it!

445
00:31:21,865 --> 00:31:25,462
Max. Why do not you come and practice your German?

446
00:31:43,313 --> 00:31:46,451
He says he and his family are on their way to the farm of his uncle.

447
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,722
Simms...

448
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,737
Cachetealo.

449
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,520
Raise your hands.

450
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:04,101
He says the farm is in this direction.

451
00:32:07,504 --> 00:32:10,720
In the upcoming tour to the canyon road.

452
00:32:15,505 --> 00:32:17,629
He says his name is Frederick Kardoff.

453
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,082
Ask yourself why your car.

454
00:32:32,663 --> 00:32:34,610
He says he had a big hole ...

455
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:41,497
Something happened and now the car will not start. Do not know.

456
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:46,853
It's loaded.

457
00:32:49,209 --> 00:32:52,042
Look at his boots. They are military footwear.

458
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:56,550
Must be a deserter. He took off his uniform, I think.

459
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:01,627
- Mitchell.
- 驴S铆?

460
00:33:02,468 --> 00:33:04,488
Take a look at the car.

461
00:33:04,523 --> 00:33:06,508
See if you can get it to boot.

462
00:33:08,462 --> 00:33:09,526
The VOY.

463
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:12,918
Where is the girl?

464
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,268
Esa es su witch, happen.

465
00:33:19,481 --> 00:33:20,545
Su chicoca.

466
00:33:22,464 --> 00:33:24,000
Su hija, earned.

467
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:28,081
I need a cable. Give me a second.

468
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,441
- Danny. - S铆.

469
00:33:34,476 --> 00:33:36,186
Give me some rations K.

470
00:33:36,221 --> 00:33:37,897
- And those of TN1? - No.

471
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,190
Portions K.

472
00:33:39,546 --> 00:33:41,921
I know that you have hidden somewhere.

473
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,500
Stalag. Check the tree. Do you? - I'm on it, Sergeant.

474
00:33:54,102 --> 00:33:56,429
Yes. I think I got ...

475
00:33:56,464 --> 00:34:00,066
That's what holds the carburetor.

476
00:34:00,391 --> 00:34:02,311
Both fell.

477
00:34:03,003 --> 00:34:04,159
This should take it.

478
00:34:04,194 --> 00:34:05,194
Turn it on.

479
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,278
It seems to be in order.

480
00:34:33,043 --> 00:34:34,043
Let them go.

481
00:34:35,388 --> 00:34:39,061
- Sgt. We report. - Cabo. Let it go.

482
00:34:40,634 --> 00:34:41,634
Now, ...

483
00:34:41,658 --> 00:34:44,327
Let's help these people and follow the path.

484
00:34:44,362 --> 00:34:46,997
Barlow, ... p谩sale Mrs. rations.

485
00:35:48,092 --> 00:35:49,092
隆Owens!

486
00:36:01,623 --> 00:36:03,780
- Monitor this window. - Okay.

487
00:36:03,815 --> 00:36:05,052
I'll check the store.

488
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:49,359
Owens. I found a way out. Follow me.

489
00:36:52,307 --> 00:36:53,980
We can go out on top.

490
00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:55,392
Yes. All right.

491
00:36:55,427 --> 00:36:57,124
Yes. Help me to upload this.

492
00:36:59,061 --> 00:37:00,416
They are heavy.

493
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:04,502
All right. Add first.

494
00:37:47,146 --> 00:37:49,165
- Owens.
- 驴Qu茅?

495
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,181
Can you hear that?

496
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:53,897
Yes.

497
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:55,594
It is our military going.

498
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:58,048
隆Alto! 隆No disparen!

499
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,449
- Do not move! - We come from the "Empty".

500
00:38:01,885 --> 00:38:04,669
- 隆Identifiquense! - Teniente Goss ...

501
00:38:09,696 --> 00:38:11,123
What do you do out here?

502
00:38:12,713 --> 00:38:14,919
We were rediccionaron this road.

503
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:17,837
We ambushed.

504
00:38:17,872 --> 00:38:20,299
They flew our trucks with artillery fire.

505
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:21,672
We lost them all.

506
00:38:22,974 --> 00:38:26,271
I'm Lieutenant Goss and he's the sergeant Owens 514.

507
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:29,267
Rev铆senlos.

508
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:36,464
- Danny, give a weapon to Lieutenant. - Well, I will.

509
00:38:36,499 --> 00:38:37,982
Simms, dame una 50th

510
00:38:41,698 --> 00:38:42,922
Here it is, sir.

511
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:45,341
Where exactly are these Germans?

512
00:38:45,376 --> 00:38:47,850
A few miles from here.

513
00:38:47,885 --> 00:38:50,754
Very well. Show us the place, Lieutenant.

514
00:38:59,649 --> 00:39:01,441
No sign of any German.

515
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:04,798
There are other places that we should review.

516
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:27,914
Good. They will not go so soon.

517
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:31,857
Is a tank.

518
00:39:32,393 --> 00:39:35,611
It's about 30 meters east of the road.

519
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:37,871
It is a Panzer ...

520
00:39:37,954 --> 00:39:39,504
They leave well hidden ...

521
00:39:39,847 --> 00:39:41,808
and always in position to fire.

522
00:39:42,443 --> 00:39:44,708
And that is the chief command.

523
00:39:46,805 --> 00:39:47,959
Klaus Shonbeck.

524
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:50,170
Is a retired tank commander.

525
00:39:50,205 --> 00:39:52,346
Taught in training brigades.

526
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:55,104
Good. Apparently, ...

527
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:57,685
has come out of retirement.

528
00:40:09,568 --> 00:40:11,598
Hey, Mitchell. Is everything okay?

529
00:40:13,983 --> 00:40:16,262
No ... you're just leaking a bit.

530
00:40:16,879 --> 00:40:19,734
You know what they say: "The old Helcats not leak oil."

531
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:21,723
Yes. Just mark their territory.

532
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:23,065
That's true.

533
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,476
Do you know the Helcats?

534
00:40:24,511 --> 00:40:25,392
Yes.

535
00:40:25,427 --> 00:40:29,221
I spent two years training maneuvers in the field with 827.

536
00:40:29,398 --> 00:40:32,159
I came here and started to be in action in November.

537
00:40:32,194 --> 00:40:34,920
Does the 827? Seriously? It is part of Division 12.

538
00:40:34,955 --> 00:40:36,443
Correct.

539
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,848
So where did they get the Helcats?

540
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:42,437
- I have no idea. Only appeared in March. - Marzo?

541
00:40:42,472 --> 00:40:45,356
We were in Togans for most of the war and then change us

542
00:40:45,391 --> 00:40:49,702
by M18, just 2 weeks of training maneuvers.

543
00:40:49,737 --> 00:40:50,737
Why?

544
00:40:50,987 --> 00:40:54,689
Helcats is that we removed in February and look at this log ...

545
00:40:54,724 --> 00:40:56,898
and it seems quite familiar.

546
00:40:56,933 --> 00:40:57,933
Seriously?

547
00:40:58,273 --> 00:40:59,494
驴Oye, Simms?

548
00:40:59,768 --> 00:41:00,768
What?

549
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,795
Think you telling the truth?

550
00:41:03,308 --> 00:41:04,308
Which part?

551
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:07,251
Do you think your Helkath was run by a bunch of black guys?

552
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:10,115
No. He's lying.

553
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:12,330
I know why I do not like.

554
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,615
驴Fuistes you who assaulted the officer with an ax?

555
00:41:21,323 --> 00:41:24,194
I know some white soldiers assigned to your battalion.

556
00:41:24,475 --> 00:41:26,284
You hear all kinds of crazy stories.

557
00:41:27,301 --> 00:41:29,667
Always leave the Helcats unguarded.

558
00:41:29,702 --> 00:41:34,148
They are always looking for pissing places to sleep, hide.

559
00:41:34,183 --> 00:41:36,186
Disobeying direct orders.

560
00:41:37,482 --> 00:41:39,272
Not in my group shot.

561
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:45,255
They say they were not trained, they were not disciplined.

562
00:41:47,025 --> 00:41:48,025
But, hey ...

563
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:52,529
What do you expect from a bunch of guys in low range?

564
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,244
We have a Panzer.

565
00:41:59,279 --> 00:42:01,523
It is two kilometers. this road.

566
00:42:01,558 --> 00:42:04,434
They have at least a dozen soldiers walk with them.

567
00:42:05,058 --> 00:42:09,178
- Simms, ... Contact the CP! - You're welcome.

568
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:14,071
Artic 4 this is Helkath 2. Are you there? Change.

569
00:42:20,346 --> 00:42:24,404
Artic 4 this is Helkath 2. I copied? Change.

570
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:32,635
Helcat 1 a Helcat 2...
驴me escuchan?

571
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:37,701
I hear you, go ahead.

572
00:42:37,736 --> 00:42:40,451
Did I hear a signal problem? Change.

573
00:42:41,189 --> 00:42:44,346
Like you're canning. Did you try to hang?

574
00:42:44,381 --> 00:42:45,381
No.

575
00:42:45,837 --> 00:42:47,300
Deals with the synthesizer.

576
00:42:47,895 --> 00:42:49,009
Already did that.

577
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:56,395
Artic 4 this is Helkath 2. I copied? Change.

578
00:43:01,718 --> 00:43:03,223
Hey, Nelson. Our radio is broken.

579
00:43:03,258 --> 00:43:06,372
Can you call the CPy give an update on the situation here?

580
00:43:06,407 --> 00:43:07,407
Sure. I will.

581
00:43:09,446 --> 00:43:12,885
Artic 4. This is Helkath 1. I copied? Change.

582
00:43:14,755 --> 00:43:19,549
Artic 4. This is Annie. Can I copy? Change.

583
00:43:25,542 --> 00:43:26,659
Oiga, Sgt.

584
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:30,017
Not have any of the radios. I think the mountains.

585
00:43:30,052 --> 00:43:32,518
- Good. Keep trying. - You're welcome.

586
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:35,966
Otherwise, I think ...

587
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,562
we should get the pants and follow the path.

588
00:43:39,597 --> 00:43:42,038
Are you sure we should not expect to reach any support?

589
00:43:42,325 --> 00:43:44,112
It is nothing more than a Panzer.

590
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:47,152
We have 2 tank destroyers.

591
00:43:47,962 --> 00:43:51,513
We also support the guys to give them help.

592
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:55,513
Agreed. But you said it was well hidden.

593
00:43:55,548 --> 00:43:57,815
No way to turn it around for a fatal shot.

594
00:43:58,066 --> 00:44:01,360
It's old and slow ... I understand that.

595
00:44:01,395 --> 00:44:04,998
We have a fleet of 76 mm. Pointing directly to the trash.

596
00:44:05,327 --> 00:44:08,238
All right. When we speak of 15,000 yards is one thing;

597
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:11,779
but you said this was about. We can not miss a shot.

598
00:44:11,814 --> 00:44:15,220
A good shot and opens up like a can of peas.

599
00:44:15,493 --> 00:44:16,493
Max.

600
00:44:17,611 --> 00:44:20,765
What if someone from the other side of the road?

601
00:44:21,378 --> 00:44:22,657
Be dead.

602
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,337
And we can help.

603
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:29,540
The kids are counting on this. We have to move now.

604
00:44:30,558 --> 00:44:33,027
I say we kill the Germans and go our way.

605
00:44:36,126 --> 00:44:37,581
Okay, John.

606
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:39,077
I'm in the game.

607
00:44:39,112 --> 00:44:41,224
But not going to kill me.

608
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:45,052
Well, what's the plan?

609
00:44:45,762 --> 00:44:47,936
My team will move forward artillery.

610
00:44:47,971 --> 00:44:50,204
We cut immediately to the right.

611
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:53,864
The Germans followed us, trying to kill us.

612
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,693
At that point, you exit the side.

613
00:44:56,728 --> 00:44:59,488
And they shoot Panzer position.

614
00:45:00,104 --> 00:45:03,013
- Will you be the bait? - Yes.

615
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:05,239
Your going to the knoquear.

616
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:08,312
Agreed.

617
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:13,278
Holon, Roger, ... Andando!

618
00:45:14,196 --> 00:45:18,365
I was thinking that Sergeant Owens should go with us.

619
00:45:18,696 --> 00:45:20,038
Sgt. Do not think it's a good idea ...

620
00:45:20,073 --> 00:45:21,807
Shut your big mouth!

621
00:45:26,731 --> 00:45:29,455
I think it's best if you stay here with the lieutenant.

622
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,761
Owens was a commander with the 827 shot.

623
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:37,804
Look, a second type in this only help.

624
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:39,450
John.

625
00:45:41,842 --> 00:45:43,781
He knows how it works.

626
00:45:48,168 --> 00:45:49,445
Owens.

627
00:45:50,755 --> 00:45:52,543
You run to the front.

628
00:45:54,342 --> 00:45:56,287
Well, let's get going!

629
00:46:04,835 --> 00:46:07,283
Welcome to the box.

630
00:46:07,727 --> 00:46:10,111
Is it good to return to Helkath?

631
00:46:10,146 --> 00:46:11,972
Go yes.

632
00:46:12,328 --> 00:46:14,036
It feels like home ...

633
00:46:15,141 --> 00:46:16,880
if you live in a box.

634
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:21,615
Hey, sorry about Simms.

635
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:24,029
Just ignore it.

636
00:46:24,802 --> 00:46:27,107
I've done enough of that in my day.

637
00:46:27,142 --> 00:46:28,363
I can handle it.

638
00:46:28,687 --> 00:46:30,426
It is a bit stupid.

639
00:46:30,461 --> 00:46:33,617
And a little picky about following the rules.

640
00:46:33,652 --> 00:46:35,647
The followed to the letter. Right?

641
00:46:36,106 --> 00:46:38,543
Yes. I think they call that "Shove it."

642
00:46:39,276 --> 00:46:41,263
Have half of that right.

643
00:46:43,777 --> 00:46:47,437
Atwood. We're ready up here. Ready to move.

644
00:46:53,743 --> 00:46:55,168
Danny boy.

645
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:56,865
What do we have here?

646
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,324
We have 3 rounds of armed rockets.

647
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,277
And 2 rounds of explosives in regular.

648
00:47:01,312 --> 00:47:04,591
- Cargans rockets. - Aye, Sgt.

649
00:47:09,943 --> 00:47:10,943
驴Max?

650
00:47:12,426 --> 00:47:13,995
AP load.

651
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:17,057
When you give them turn on again just to make sure.

652
00:47:17,092 --> 00:47:18,359
I understood.

653
00:47:20,122 --> 00:47:21,917
If one of your friends is on the right

654
00:47:21,952 --> 00:47:23,266
I will stop until you return.

655
00:47:23,301 --> 00:47:24,338
Great.

656
00:47:24,373 --> 00:47:25,602
See you around.

657
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:26,786
Bon Voyage.

658
00:47:26,821 --> 00:47:27,936
Come on, s谩canos.

659
00:47:35,454 --> 00:47:38,485
Ramrod. Keep your speed.

660
00:47:39,047 --> 00:47:40,401
I understood.

661
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:47,923
Where will the Jerrys? Let's grab.

662
00:48:03,406 --> 00:48:06,811
Ramrod. To here. Fire when ready.

663
00:48:06,846 --> 00:48:08,690
- Clear! - On my way.

664
00:48:11,842 --> 00:48:15,408
Another round of APs., Straight to the armory and not shoot more.

665
00:48:16,985 --> 00:48:18,626
- Clear! - On my way.

666
00:48:22,325 --> 00:48:24,216
Mitchell. Stop here.

667
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:27,533
Shoot my signal. Two yards on the left.

668
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:34,272
2 Panzer saliento flank. Move it, move, move!

669
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,041
Whitaker, 隆Sal de all铆!

670
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:15,338
All right. We Germans to the West!

671
00:49:28,623 --> 00:49:31,261
They gave the sergeant! He is dead!

672
00:49:41,907 --> 00:49:43,404
Good. Now where are we going?

673
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:46,159
Mitchell! Do not stop! Follow the road!

674
00:49:48,634 --> 00:49:53,314
821, this is 601. We have been fired, but the damage is repairable.

675
00:49:56,632 --> 00:49:59,147
Can you see the enemy tank? Change.

676
00:50:19,587 --> 00:50:20,713
What happened?

677
00:50:22,111 --> 00:50:23,550
They're all dead.

678
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:27,258
- My eyes are burning. - I'll get the rest.

679
00:50:27,678 --> 00:50:30,626
- Are you going to be okay? - Yes, I'll be fine.

680
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:33,779
- I can not get away with this leg. - Take my rifle.

681
00:50:34,261 --> 00:50:35,499
It's loaded.

682
00:50:37,572 --> 00:50:38,792
Be watching the road.

683
00:50:40,591 --> 00:50:42,511
I'll know I'm here.

684
00:50:42,546 --> 00:50:43,632
Bon Voyage.

685
00:50:50,686 --> 00:50:52,336
Stop! Stop! Stop!

686
00:50:52,371 --> 00:50:53,371
Oye, Mitchell.

687
00:50:53,563 --> 00:50:56,919
This bridge is not going to endure. Back off! Back off!

688
00:51:10,232 --> 00:51:13,553
Whitaker. This is Simms. Are copies me? Change.

689
00:51:13,755 --> 00:51:15,314
The sergeant is dead.

690
00:51:16,536 --> 00:51:20,125
- Mitchell. Did anyone survive? - I could not see anything.

691
00:51:21,408 --> 00:51:25,626
I saw 3 German tanks. Whitaker made sure that one.

692
00:51:27,257 --> 00:51:28,582
We are trapped.

693
00:51:28,617 --> 00:51:31,258
Since we can not go over this bridge, the only way out

694
00:51:31,293 --> 00:51:33,575
Back on the road with you onths Germany.

695
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:35,858
Do not take for them to come get us.

696
00:51:36,084 --> 00:51:37,507
We gotta get out of here.

697
00:51:39,181 --> 00:51:43,424
This is Helkath 2. Does anyone copies me? Change.

698
00:51:48,475 --> 00:51:50,999
Can I copy? Is there anybody out there?

699
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:55,561
This is Angel Avenger. Anyone copy me? Change.

700
00:52:05,364 --> 00:52:07,737
隆Let's go! 隆De prisa!

701
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:12,941
He has to return to battle!

702
00:52:25,295 --> 00:52:27,902
We will be stuck until someone comes for us.

703
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:31,863
No higher than ground. Maybe we can have a stronger signal.

704
00:52:32,687 --> 00:52:35,808
Danny! Let it. Come on now.

705
00:52:57,475 --> 00:53:00,864
Artic 4 this is Helkath 2. I copied?

706
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:06,837
Does anyone listen to me? Change.

707
00:53:13,187 --> 00:53:17,034
Artic 4 this is the Avenging Angel. Can I copy?

708
00:53:20,562 --> 00:53:21,625
You hear that?

709
00:53:24,091 --> 00:53:25,559
This does not look good.

710
00:53:38,122 --> 00:53:39,122
Lieutenant.

711
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:44,918
Whitaker is injured, but will recover. He's watching the road.

712
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,386
The others were all killed.

713
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,393
Atwood is dead.

714
00:53:55,428 --> 00:53:57,583
So you suggest we do?

715
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:00,647
You should ask him, not me.

716
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:06,757
- Why would I do that? - It's a sergeant.

717
00:54:06,792 --> 00:54:08,628
It has more range than you all.

718
00:54:09,023 --> 00:54:10,944
This is not my army. Do you remember?

719
00:54:10,979 --> 00:54:12,968
This is a segregated army.

720
00:54:13,081 --> 00:54:15,125
I will not take orders from him.

721
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,767
Cabo. I suggest that aside their differences ...

722
00:54:17,802 --> 00:54:20,658
I will take the position of sergeant. Barlow, you're the gunner now.

723
00:54:20,693 --> 00:54:21,384
What?

724
00:54:21,419 --> 00:54:23,324
Wait ... Are you crazy? I was not trained for that.

725
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,151
What are you talking about?

726
00:54:24,186 --> 00:54:26,814
You trained enough when we were on maneuvers.

727
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:29,442
- They were only 3 hours, nothing more. - Barlow, Shut up!

728
00:54:29,477 --> 00:54:30,864
You gunner now!

729
00:54:30,899 --> 00:54:35,452
Owens was commander shot for 2 years. Helcats knows better than us.

730
00:54:35,487 --> 00:54:37,328
Mitchell. Did you hear what I said?

731
00:54:37,363 --> 00:54:39,138
I will not take orders from a black.

732
00:54:39,173 --> 00:54:40,879
Cabo. You have to solve it.

733
00:54:40,914 --> 00:54:44,979
Shonbeck comes along that road, and when I do, I'll kill him.

734
00:54:45,014 --> 00:54:46,479
Lieutenant wait.

735
00:54:46,514 --> 00:54:47,924
Take this.

736
00:55:03,631 --> 00:55:06,527
Have you ever destroyed an enemy tank?

737
00:55:06,826 --> 00:55:08,609
9 Tanks Harton.

738
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,100
Other 4 ...

739
00:55:10,124 --> 00:55:12,342
Just leave the Helcats and get out of here.

740
00:55:12,377 --> 00:55:16,045
Barlow. Take mechanisms armory and repair parts.

741
00:55:16,883 --> 00:55:20,243
I cut the parts. ... Mitchell destroys the battery.

742
00:55:20,278 --> 00:55:23,604
I will not let my Helkath here for the Nazis. I'll stay here.

743
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:25,225
Are you crazy? They have 2 tanks.

744
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:28,031
As you outnumber you think about starting. Right?

745
00:55:28,066 --> 00:55:29,162
I knew it.

746
00:55:34,148 --> 00:55:36,294
I do not want to die today.

747
00:55:36,935 --> 00:55:38,514
Mitchell and I can handle it.

748
00:55:39,835 --> 00:55:42,445
If you want to Barlow started and, after later.

749
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:46,242
But they did not train me to flee the battle.

750
00:55:47,986 --> 00:55:51,473
Why risk our lives? What for?

751
00:55:51,508 --> 00:55:54,960
The American vehicles come through these channels.

752
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,707
It is the main route until they fix the bridge.

753
00:56:00,009 --> 00:56:04,913
Everyone, including the general use that route.

754
00:56:06,346 --> 00:56:08,063
S茅 a h茅roe, Simms.

755
00:56:08,517 --> 00:56:10,663
Maybe you win a medal for it.

756
00:56:11,874 --> 00:56:12,955
驴Yo? No.

757
00:56:13,981 --> 00:56:17,442
Are you the one that is marked by a heroic destiny. Right?

758
00:56:19,105 --> 00:56:22,614
- What are you trying to say? - I know it.

759
00:56:23,267 --> 00:56:26,397
This is the last chance you have to do something well done.

760
00:56:26,432 --> 00:56:27,807
The war ended.

761
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:31,189
You just want to go with your cotton fields and tell your old ...

762
00:56:31,224 --> 00:56:33,804
how you led a group of whites in battle.

763
00:56:36,188 --> 00:56:37,762
My dad passed away.

764
00:56:38,451 --> 00:56:41,540
Not working in a cotton field. He was a soldier.

765
00:56:42,421 --> 00:56:46,339
He fought in France in 1917.

766
00:56:47,132 --> 00:56:49,656
In one of the most decorated battalions.

767
00:56:50,398 --> 00:56:53,250
The French gave a prize of honor.

768
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:58,008
But Americans do not give awards to blacks.

769
00:56:59,343 --> 00:57:02,724
When he came home and asked for equal treatment ...

770
00:57:05,728 --> 00:57:07,613
lo lincharon.

771
00:57:09,699 --> 00:57:12,790
That was the last time I saw him.

772
00:57:13,191 --> 00:57:15,503
Hanging from that tree.

773
00:57:15,854 --> 00:57:19,144
And if it is God's desire that comes alive

774
00:57:19,179 --> 00:57:22,616
not me vanagloriar茅 for days like this.

775
00:57:22,748 --> 00:57:26,385
And certainly not to fight alongside someone like you.

776
00:57:30,481 --> 00:57:34,237
Because it's always the same story for the black.

777
00:57:34,272 --> 00:57:37,619
First your country, then your rights.

778
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,744
So we fight our country's battles.

779
00:57:43,855 --> 00:57:46,746
But we never see the rights,

780
00:57:46,781 --> 00:57:50,846
or simple respect for human dignity for what we have done.

781
00:57:52,205 --> 00:57:54,086
The panzer are coming!

782
00:57:55,694 --> 00:57:57,357
Come on, Mitchell! Move forward!

783
00:57:57,392 --> 00:57:58,812
隆Ya voy! 隆Ya voy!

784
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:27,730
The Panzer just went behind the building.

785
00:58:27,765 --> 00:58:30,057
I can not give if you do not see them!

786
00:58:30,092 --> 00:58:33,882
If that tank out of that corner, knocked down. It's that simple.

787
00:58:33,917 --> 00:58:37,673
Go to the tower to see exactly where they are. Well?

788
00:58:38,165 --> 00:58:39,222
Do you understand?

789
00:58:40,303 --> 00:58:42,067
Simms, ... do you understand?

790
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:43,832
Shut up! I get it.

791
00:59:30,648 --> 00:59:33,713
Owens says the tank stopped.

792
00:59:35,064 --> 00:59:37,709
I heard the tank. All right?

793
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:40,430
There's an enemy tank to the other side of the building.

794
00:59:41,774 --> 00:59:43,088
Fri for being.

795
00:59:51,576 --> 00:59:53,342
This, gentlemen ...

796
00:59:53,668 --> 00:59:55,113
is a cable to the radio.

797
00:59:55,148 --> 00:59:57,340
Owens just build them a dish.

798
01:00:03,486 --> 01:00:05,277
All right. Try it now.

799
01:00:06,063 --> 01:00:09,700
Artic 4 this is the Helkath 2. I copied? Change.

800
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,242
This is the second Helcar Artic 4. I copied? Change.

801
01:00:15,277 --> 01:00:18,886
This is Artic 4. Forward Helkath 2. Change.

802
01:00:19,394 --> 01:00:23,553
We were ambushed by 3 German tanks. They are old Panzer.

803
01:00:23,588 --> 01:00:26,715
Atwood is dead. The Whitaker Group was killed.

804
01:00:27,105 --> 01:00:28,145
And it is destroyed.

805
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:29,180
Por favor, repita.

806
01:00:29,185 --> 01:00:31,537
Enemies many tanks? Change.

807
01:00:31,921 --> 01:00:35,835
1 has been fixed, but there are still two trying to destroy us.

808
01:00:35,984 --> 01:00:36,984
Lord.

809
01:00:37,158 --> 01:00:39,297
We received a radio message Artwood group.

810
01:00:39,332 --> 01:00:40,269
Where are they?

811
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:41,815
It is hard to hear, sir.

812
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:43,837
What is your current position? Change.

813
01:00:43,872 --> 01:00:47,204
We are located 4 Kms. Al Sur de Saint Andreasberg.

814
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:49,742
After un molino abandonado in the 520.

815
01:00:50,377 --> 01:00:52,769
We are trapped in a canyon.

816
01:00:57,884 --> 01:00:59,629
They were ambushed here in the 520.

817
01:00:59,664 --> 01:01:01,340
The bridge is under repair.

818
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:03,547
The diverted by alternative road.

819
01:01:03,582 --> 01:01:04,904
Send a message.

820
01:01:04,939 --> 01:01:07,498
Do not let the overall pass. It's not safe.

821
01:01:07,778 --> 01:01:10,060
- And send someone there. - Yes, sir.

822
01:01:11,156 --> 01:01:12,156
Did it work?

823
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,325
We talked with the command.

824
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,470
We will send you some help, but for now, they say that we are alone.

825
01:01:17,505 --> 01:01:19,131
Now that tank is not going to move.

826
01:01:19,166 --> 01:01:21,608
He stands waiting for us to come out first.

827
01:01:21,643 --> 01:01:24,027
If the Germans take their 3 tanks and run,

828
01:01:24,062 --> 01:01:26,280
come here and force us to leave.

829
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:28,498
And that tower place you found?

830
01:01:28,533 --> 01:01:30,286
Yes. That's a good idea.

831
01:01:30,321 --> 01:01:31,550
You started as gunners. Right?

832
01:01:31,585 --> 01:01:32,860
Yeah, and how much?

833
01:01:32,895 --> 01:01:36,409
If you want to fight possibilities, we have to be you and me up there.

834
01:01:36,444 --> 01:01:38,160
Simms. Are you going to do this or not?

835
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:45,269
The general was 20 minutes ago. They are sending soldiers to fetch him.

836
01:01:45,304 --> 01:01:45,923
This is not good.

837
01:01:45,958 --> 01:01:48,745
Who do we have on that side that we can send? Do we gunsmiths?

838
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,612
I can take a soldier and make a safety line.

839
01:01:50,647 --> 01:01:52,205
Do it and fast.

840
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:59,591
Then we were surrounded, surrounded the village with artillery in 45 min.

841
01:02:00,895 --> 01:02:03,602
Les resist for 25 hours straight.

842
01:02:04,105 --> 01:02:06,388
Is 22 hours, gentlemen.

843
01:02:06,769 --> 01:02:10,107
We were not going to give an inch of the villa.

844
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,374
What is it?

845
01:02:22,378 --> 01:02:23,933
I thought I heard something.

846
01:02:27,817 --> 01:02:30,266
Do you think you brought enough supplement?

847
01:02:32,065 --> 01:02:34,808
It's not a field trip.

848
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:45,473
How on earth will move this thing?

849
01:02:46,213 --> 01:02:48,516
I do not know. But we have to move somehow.

850
01:02:50,371 --> 01:02:56,841
Go to the tank 821. Tank 544 for help. Change.

851
01:02:57,538 --> 01:03:01,085
I understood. We start now. Over and out.

852
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:08,239
544. You see the enemy tank? Change.

853
01:03:09,942 --> 01:03:14,553
We caught the enemy tank behind the mill. Change.

854
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:22,591
Stay there. Let's force them out. Change.

855
01:03:48,405 --> 01:03:50,555
Come on! Come on! Follow!

856
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:55,453
- A little more! - All right. To the left.

857
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,441
Right there.

858
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:00,909
I think that's the closest we're going to have it.

859
01:04:00,944 --> 01:04:02,708
Give me ammo.

860
01:04:02,743 --> 01:04:04,193
It works.

861
01:04:11,711 --> 01:04:13,887
It's moving! I need ammo!

862
01:04:15,363 --> 01:04:16,941
All right! Back! Back!

863
01:04:23,014 --> 01:04:25,476
- Hurry up! It moves! - We have to move right.

864
01:04:28,501 --> 01:04:31,071
They failed. The Germans are retreating.

865
01:04:31,106 --> 01:04:33,642
It may be your last chance to leave.

866
01:04:42,099 --> 01:04:43,099
Again!

867
01:04:51,707 --> 01:04:53,461
隆Simms...! 隆Ag谩chate!

868
01:04:59,642 --> 01:05:00,708
Germans!

869
01:05:09,044 --> 01:05:11,245
We can not stay here. We must return to the mill.

870
01:05:11,258 --> 01:05:12,488
Come back. Ready?

871
01:05:12,523 --> 01:05:13,557
隆Let's go!

872
01:05:41,665 --> 01:05:43,151
On my way!

873
01:05:46,763 --> 01:05:49,282
Straight Shooting! Give back!

874
01:05:50,543 --> 01:05:51,543
Quick!

875
01:05:51,841 --> 01:05:53,057
I'm trying!

876
01:05:55,611 --> 01:05:56,852
On my way!

877
01:07:03,377 --> 01:07:07,057
Tank 821. Can you hear me?

878
01:07:10,419 --> 01:07:11,836
Keep forward.

879
01:07:14,023 --> 01:07:15,928
821. Why do not they move?

880
01:07:23,259 --> 01:07:26,111
They are dead! They're all dead!

881
01:07:27,949 --> 01:07:30,878
Let's go! Follow me.

882
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:41,493
Artic 4 a Helcat 2. Repito.

883
01:07:41,528 --> 01:07:44,494
Artic 4 to Helcat 2. 驴Me copian? Change.

884
01:07:44,529 --> 01:07:47,718
- What's the matter? - I do not respond, sir.

885
01:07:47,753 --> 01:07:49,303
Only disappeared.

886
01:07:49,338 --> 01:07:50,495
Keep trying to locate them.

887
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:52,866
I need to know where they usually are and.

888
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:56,705
Artic 4 Avenging Angel. Are there? I repeat.

889
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:59,883
Artic 4 Avenging Angel. Can I copy? Change.

890
01:08:06,551 --> 01:08:08,655
Tank! There is a tank on the right!

891
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,416
隆Retrocedan!

892
01:08:14,227 --> 01:08:17,867
I can not see. I'm blind. How far can I go back?

893
01:08:17,902 --> 01:08:20,795
About 40 meters, then turn left.

894
01:08:39,394 --> 01:08:41,905
The shooter is not working. We were without electricity.

895
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:43,562
Use the lever!

896
01:08:44,212 --> 01:08:47,349
- It's stuck! Something is wrong! - Well. Wait.

897
01:09:04,104 --> 01:09:07,049
Sh枚nbeck want to be here.

898
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:15,158
Clear.

899
01:10:16,193 --> 01:10:18,329
- Are they all dead? - Yes. They are.

900
01:10:25,431 --> 01:10:28,388
- More Germans you see? - No.

901
01:10:29,891 --> 01:10:32,651
I think Mitchell gave that last German tank.

902
01:10:37,179 --> 01:10:38,285
Thirsty?

903
01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:43,047
I'm fine.

904
01:10:53,345 --> 01:10:54,557
Fui yo.

905
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:57,987
What are you talking Owens?

906
01:10:59,065 --> 01:11:02,769
I was the one who assaulted the Caucasian officer you spoke earlier.

907
01:11:05,362 --> 01:11:08,425
- His name was Captain Davis. - Since you started giving canned Owens.

908
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:09,576
Of course not.

909
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:14,023
In early February, we were going to fight in Colmack Parquet.

910
01:11:14,058 --> 01:11:17,613
We lost four Helcats and morale collapsed.

911
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:20,437
We were prepared for winter.

912
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:27,633
Harrison, Cooper. Put out the fire. You know I can not.

913
01:11:28,155 --> 01:11:31,088
Come on. Give us a break, Sgt. Try to survive.

914
01:11:31,442 --> 01:11:35,180
I prefer to fire instead of pee, not to freeze to death.

915
01:11:39,486 --> 01:11:42,424
Is it too much to ask a couple of extra socks?

916
01:11:42,692 --> 01:11:45,181
Just want to kill some Nazis.

917
01:11:45,216 --> 01:11:47,587
They do not mind your little black feet.

918
01:11:48,191 --> 01:11:50,434
Sgt. When are they going to give the proper supplements?

919
01:11:50,469 --> 01:11:52,161
Grips, something ...

920
01:11:53,898 --> 01:11:56,530
I ask only following the regular channels.

921
01:11:57,178 --> 01:12:00,038
They have to turn off the fire and return to Helkath.

922
01:12:00,073 --> 01:12:02,419
You have to be sober.

923
01:12:02,454 --> 01:12:04,765
5 minutes. Just give us 5 minutes.

924
01:12:05,008 --> 01:12:08,297
- Only puedo feel mis pies. - Come on, Owens.

925
01:12:08,759 --> 01:12:11,279
What would your mother think if I saw it?

926
01:12:11,314 --> 01:12:13,131
I have no family, Sgt.

927
01:12:14,402 --> 01:12:16,972
You are the closest thing to a mother to me.

928
01:12:19,303 --> 01:12:21,596
You have no one who will receive it. Right?

929
01:12:24,144 --> 01:12:27,630
Going home? Do you think you're going home?

930
01:12:27,665 --> 01:12:29,674
Do you think we will survive this war?

931
01:12:30,315 --> 01:12:34,263
We will not leave here, Sergeant. You will not succeed.

932
01:12:34,298 --> 01:12:36,214
And we less.

933
01:12:38,257 --> 01:12:40,088
You have to stay warm.

934
01:12:46,674 --> 01:12:48,296
5 Minutes.

935
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:53,632
- For the 827 - 827!

936
01:12:56,463 --> 01:12:59,008
Finally, take your computer.

937
01:12:59,406 --> 01:13:02,330
- Do not think I would see this day. - You are right.

938
01:13:05,516 --> 01:13:07,481
- You what you painted? - Yes.

939
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:10,314
- It's good, right? - Yes. This good.

940
01:13:10,349 --> 01:13:14,049
My nephew is a painter. It looks like something he would do.

941
01:13:15,004 --> 01:13:16,547
Has 5 years.

942
01:13:21,217 --> 01:13:24,022
You think it's funny, right? That was not funny.

943
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,082
What the hell is going on here?

944
01:13:29,601 --> 01:13:31,255
What they said about ...!

945
01:13:37,823 --> 01:13:39,200
Very well.

946
01:13:40,759 --> 01:13:42,327
They are drunk.

947
01:13:45,436 --> 01:13:47,710
Owens. This way.

948
01:13:51,411 --> 01:13:53,456
Is that how you manage your team artillery?

949
01:13:53,491 --> 01:13:55,415
They know they can not light a fire.

950
01:13:55,450 --> 01:13:56,743
But they were freezing, sir.

951
01:13:56,778 --> 01:13:57,875
We need socks, gloves ...

952
01:13:57,910 --> 01:13:58,991
and warm coats, sir.

953
01:13:59,008 --> 01:14:00,844
And will!

954
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:04,250
When available.

955
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:07,240
- You! The driver! - Cape Harrison, sir.

956
01:14:07,275 --> 01:14:09,745
Harrison. Go get this now Helkath!

957
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:12,476
I do not want to see you out of that seat until the day of rest.

958
01:14:12,511 --> 01:14:13,831
- Yes, sir! - Walking!

959
01:14:18,258 --> 01:14:20,447
The rest of you will go on patrol.

960
01:14:22,287 --> 01:14:24,168
Owens. I want you to take them ...

961
01:14:24,203 --> 01:14:25,907
at the top there.

962
01:14:25,942 --> 01:14:28,660
And I want to know if there is someone beside the river bank.

963
01:14:29,366 --> 01:14:32,033
Do not know if it's a good idea, sir. They are drunk.

964
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:34,701
It's a great idea. And they can walk around.

965
01:14:36,443 --> 01:14:38,902
Iran before the take.

966
01:14:39,746 --> 01:14:41,770
And I want to report me ...

967
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:43,412
personally.

968
01:14:44,425 --> 01:14:45,784
In an hour.

969
01:15:02,082 --> 01:15:03,142
Here we are ...

970
01:15:03,177 --> 01:15:04,869
fighting as the army of the United States.

971
01:15:04,904 --> 01:15:08,162
Against the enemy think they're better than anyone else.

972
01:15:08,474 --> 01:15:11,084
But everything in this army thinks they are better than us.

973
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:14,145
How is it that we have no one fighting for us?

974
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:17,171
It's like a dog following its own tail. Get it?

975
01:15:17,206 --> 01:15:18,716
Yes, we understand. Now shut up!

976
01:15:18,751 --> 01:15:21,150
- You c谩llate, Gaines. - 隆Ambos, c谩llense!

977
01:15:21,185 --> 01:15:22,469
They are too noisy!

978
01:15:22,504 --> 01:15:24,572
And we would not be here if they were not drunk.

979
01:15:24,607 --> 01:15:25,851
I'm not drunk.

980
01:15:27,543 --> 01:15:28,571
Get up! Get up!

981
01:15:28,606 --> 01:15:29,802
Maybe a little.

982
01:15:31,422 --> 01:15:33,829
Smitty. No more talking.

983
01:15:33,864 --> 01:15:36,720
Just give me my pail and be silent.

984
01:15:36,755 --> 01:15:39,484
The'll have when we're done with this patrol.

985
01:15:40,081 --> 01:15:43,562
Can you rush it? It is taking too long.

986
01:15:44,363 --> 01:15:45,910
You do not know where we are. Right?

987
01:15:45,945 --> 01:15:47,321
And do you?

988
01:15:48,368 --> 01:15:52,440
We can go through that river bank and be in camp in 5 minutes.

989
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:54,854
I would like to see that.

990
01:15:54,889 --> 01:15:56,578
You made the point.

991
01:15:56,984 --> 01:15:59,407
With how drunk you are, Sergeant?

992
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:01,237
Maybe have them Sober.

993
01:16:01,272 --> 01:16:03,414
Just do not take my trash can.

994
01:16:03,449 --> 01:16:07,214
I will not. Now promises that speak no more.

995
01:16:08,017 --> 01:16:09,017
Let's go.

996
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:13,983
I'm serious, Sgt. No ...

997
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:15,936
Down!

998
01:16:19,782 --> 01:16:21,969
Cooper! Get behind the tree!

999
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:36,284
Gaines! Lower your head!

1000
01:16:37,272 --> 01:16:39,701
Walk back and I'll cover you. Get it?

1001
01:16:39,736 --> 01:16:40,448
Good!

1002
01:16:40,483 --> 01:16:41,307
At three!

1003
01:16:41,342 --> 01:16:42,342
One ... two ...

1004
01:16:45,198 --> 01:16:46,275
Three!

1005
01:16:50,679 --> 01:16:51,919
隆Gaines!

1006
01:17:02,709 --> 01:17:06,192
Davis knew he was sending in a suicide mission.

1007
01:17:08,654 --> 01:17:11,243
When I got to camp, I got drunk.

1008
01:17:11,278 --> 01:17:14,568
When I went to give the report was when I attacked.

1009
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:17,941
They stated that it was an ambush.

1010
01:17:17,976 --> 01:17:20,475
Since then they have not been asked if he had not done that,

1011
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:22,892
yet perhaps there would be a 827.

1012
01:17:29,591 --> 01:17:30,591
Look at that.

1013
01:17:33,338 --> 01:17:36,340
- The Helcats are returning. - They have been given.

1014
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:40,391
They are coming back. Perhaps no German tank behind them.

1015
01:17:52,494 --> 01:17:53,494
I can use this.

1016
01:17:53,518 --> 01:17:55,878
Want to attack some enemy tanks with a rocket launcher?

1017
01:17:56,268 --> 01:17:58,062
How are you going to bring?

1018
01:17:59,618 --> 01:18:02,105
The bottom of a tank is the weakest. Right?

1019
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:03,063
Right.

1020
01:18:03,098 --> 01:18:07,148
If we can convince the Germans that our Helkath is damaged, ...

1021
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:11,034
then we could move to a position where we can give.

1022
01:18:11,069 --> 01:18:13,360
How are you going to shoot under the tank?

1023
01:18:16,899 --> 01:18:17,946
Te show.

1024
01:18:52,735 --> 01:18:54,678
All right. I think I gave you all.

1025
01:18:55,834 --> 01:18:57,215
Are you okay?

1026
01:19:01,066 --> 01:19:02,518
- Danny boy? - I'm fine.

1027
01:19:02,553 --> 01:19:03,971
We're here ... Open up!

1028
01:19:04,251 --> 01:19:07,251
- Mitchell! Are you hearing this? - Shut up. It's me, Simms.

1029
01:19:07,286 --> 01:19:09,272
Danny opens the escape hatch.

1030
01:19:11,726 --> 01:19:14,346
- Why are you below! - What happened to Helkath?

1031
01:19:14,381 --> 01:19:16,374
We got the shooter and now does not work.

1032
01:19:16,409 --> 01:19:19,170
- Were you followed? - Yes. There is one sure way.

1033
01:19:19,205 --> 01:19:20,517
Look, we have an idea.

1034
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:22,985
I need anything that we can burn.

1035
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:24,523
Where is the metal box?

1036
01:19:32,261 --> 01:19:34,321
I sense帽ar茅 as ending an enemy tank.

1037
01:19:34,856 --> 01:19:37,866
As we did on the Eastern Front.

1038
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:42,380
Hands up!

1039
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:44,249
Hands up!

1040
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:47,698
Bota el arma, Shonbeck.

1041
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:08,964
Lieutenant.

1042
01:20:09,966 --> 01:20:13,854
You know what we do with the prisoners escape?

1043
01:20:20,533 --> 01:20:21,851
We killed them.

1044
01:20:23,882 --> 01:20:25,308
Kill them!

1045
01:21:06,855 --> 01:21:08,141
隆T贸mala!

1046
01:21:08,295 --> 01:21:09,655
In rendimos.

1047
01:21:11,115 --> 01:21:12,460
T贸mala.

1048
01:21:37,898 --> 01:21:40,372
I'll miss you, buddy.

1049
01:22:14,628 --> 01:22:16,744
隆Danny! 隆Danny!

1050
01:22:17,841 --> 01:22:19,066
Give me your lighter.

1051
01:22:23,263 --> 01:22:25,692
I'll light this. You will release a lot of smoke.

1052
01:22:25,727 --> 01:22:27,906
Please do see the Helkath is knocked out.

1053
01:22:27,941 --> 01:22:30,451
Hopefully this will guide opening.

1054
01:22:34,095 --> 01:22:36,838
Hopefully the Owens plan work. Get it?

1055
01:22:36,873 --> 01:22:37,873
I get it.

1056
01:22:41,138 --> 01:22:42,529
The group is ready.

1057
01:22:42,927 --> 01:22:44,298
I do not recommend staying there.

1058
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:46,577
You call in the hole and away from the Germans.

1059
01:22:50,213 --> 01:22:52,158
You know you're going to kill.

1060
01:22:53,123 --> 01:22:55,491
It is the only way to make a killing shot.

1061
01:22:55,526 --> 01:22:57,934
If that tank coming up this opening,

1062
01:22:57,969 --> 01:23:00,058
then we'll have a shot.

1063
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:02,968
Good luck.

1064
01:23:16,431 --> 01:23:17,840
隆Is dropping humus!

1065
01:23:19,142 --> 01:23:21,334
I hope that the Germans believe it.

1066
01:25:37,163 --> 01:25:38,419
Come on ...

1067
01:26:44,016 --> 01:26:45,230
What happened here?

1068
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:47,619
We ambushed.

1069
01:26:48,595 --> 01:26:52,527
Three Panzer waiting for the Americans to pass.

1070
01:27:14,691 --> 01:27:16,664
A good disaster, right?

1071
01:27:18,542 --> 01:27:20,779
Many people were killed, sir.

1072
01:27:22,062 --> 01:27:24,289
Corporal Simms told me what you did.

1073
01:27:24,324 --> 01:27:26,875
He said if he was not here to deal,

1074
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:29,268
Germans would still be on the road.

1075
01:27:29,303 --> 01:27:31,626
Thanks to you, many lives were saved today.

1076
01:27:32,389 --> 01:27:34,192
I only did my duty, sir.

1077
01:27:34,227 --> 01:27:37,755
The place also told me that you are a good example.

1078
01:27:38,046 --> 01:27:41,405
That makes good decisions, and that is firm.

1079
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:47,171
I will recommend for a silver star, Sgt.

1080
01:27:48,592 --> 01:27:50,536
That really is not necessary, sir.

1081
01:27:50,571 --> 01:27:52,891
Will you tell me how I have to run my division, Sergeant?

1082
01:27:53,213 --> 01:27:53,721
No, sir.

1083
01:27:53,756 --> 01:27:55,110
So I thought.

1084
01:27:59,669 --> 01:28:01,672
Let me see that leg, Sgt.

1085
01:28:05,229 --> 01:28:06,755
It looks like you did.

1086
01:28:08,726 --> 01:28:09,726
Si.

1087
01:28:13,719 --> 01:28:15,348
Got my gun?

1088
01:28:49,016 --> 01:28:50,435
How are we doing?

1089
01:28:52,187 --> 01:28:53,876
I'm not sure.

1090
01:29:00,381 --> 01:29:02,032
Lo hicistes bien, Danny.

1091
01:29:05,221 --> 01:29:06,390
Very well.

1092
01:29:07,856 --> 01:29:09,040
Thank you.

1093
01:29:22,923 --> 01:29:25,612
I'm surprised to find you still alive.

1094
01:29:25,647 --> 01:29:28,302
I thought that fire below I killed you.

1095
01:29:29,507 --> 01:29:32,303
Maybe I have an angel watching over me.

1096
01:29:33,995 --> 01:29:35,803
Maybe so.

1097
01:29:46,009 --> 01:29:47,089
Thank you.

1098
01:30:06,945 --> 01:30:08,605
Then Sergeant ...

1099
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:12,519
What was the name of which I spoke Helkath?

1100
01:30:15,764 --> 01:30:18,115
When I saw the name of that thing ...

1101
01:30:29,087 --> 01:30:33,321
IN MEMORY OF THOSE WHO THINK THAT IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM.

1102
01:30:33,356 --> 01:30:37,889
REGARDLESS OF RACE.
