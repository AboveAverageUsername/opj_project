{260}{344}In the beginning,|God created beast and man
{346}{408}so that both might live|in friendship
{410}{510}and share dominion|over a world at peace.
{512}{656}But in the fullness of time,|evil men betrayed God's trust,
{658}{708}and in disobedience|to His holy word
{710}{768}waged bloody wars,
{770}{836}not only|against theirown kind,
{838}{984}but against the apes,|whom they reduced to slavery..
{986}{1100}Then God, in His wrath,|sent the world a savior,
{1101}{1168}miraculously born of two apes,
{1169}{1285}who descended on Earth|from Earth's own future.
{1287}{1338}And man was afraid,
{1340}{1441}for both parent apes possessed|the power of speech.
{1443}{1479}Come on!
{1838}{1873}Cornelius!
{2771}{2838}so both were brutally murdered.
{2840}{2923}But the child ape survived
{2925}{3014}and grew up to|set his fellow creatures free
{3016}{3093}from the yoke|of human slavery..
{3095}{3133}Do.
{3291}{3323}No!
{5766}{5837}Yet in the aftermath|of this victory.,
{5839}{5900}the surface of the world|was ravaged
{5902}{6011}by the vilest war|in human history..
{6012}{6061}The great cities of the world|split as under
{6063}{6109}and were flattened.
{6111}{6169}And out of one such city,
{6171}{6265}our savior led a remnant|of those who survived
{6267}{6332}in search of green erpastures,
{6334}{6433}where ape and human might|forever live in friendship
{6435}{6529}according to divine will.
{6531}{6605}His name was Caesar,
{6607}{6732}and this is hisstory.|in those far-off days.
{11898}{11952}You'll never|make it,Jake.
{11954}{12001}Nah, we'll make it.
{12035}{12082}I'll show you how.
{12568}{12604}Thanks, Aldo.
{12606}{12676}You will call me by|my proper rank..General!
{12706}{12744}Yes, General.
{12818}{12857}Don't put him|in the corral.
{12858}{12890}I won't be long.
{12893}{12958}Ape shall never kill ape.
{12960}{13034}Ape shall never kill ape.
{13036}{13090}Ape shall never kill ape.
{13092}{13138}Ape shall never kill ape.
{13140}{13218}Shall ape|ever kill man?
{13248}{13289}You're late, General Aldo.
{13291}{13345}Come and read this|to the class.
{13347}{13396}I won't.
{13398}{13461}You won't|because you can't,
{13463}{13558}and you can't because|you don't want to learn,
{13560}{13614}and it is my duty to|report this to Caesar.
{13650}{13717}If my father|were a gorilla,
{13718}{13799}we'd be learning|riding instead ofwriting.
{13872}{13906}Silence.
{13940}{13966}Silence.
{14004}{14135}Cornelius, you are|Caesar's son and heir.
{14137}{14220}Being a good rider isn't enough|for being a good ruler,
{14222}{14270}though in human history,
{14272}{14330}quite a number|of military dictators
{14332}{14370}seem to have thought so.
{14372}{14406}Now, all of you take up
{14408}{14439}your charcoal sticks|and your parchments
{14441}{14501}and copy down|what I've written.
{14502}{14574}The best shall be hung|from these hooks.
{14575}{14652}I can think of better things|to hang from those hooks.
{14684}{14742}But, Virgil, can we|tamper with time?
{14743}{14784}- Accept my premise.|-What premise?
{14786}{14866}That since man once learned|to travel faster than sound,
{14867}{14921}he could later have learned|to travel faster than light.
{14922}{14961}We accept.
{14963}{15014}Imagine a musician|giving a live broadcast
{15016}{15070}from what was once London|to what was once New York
{15072}{15099}on a Wednesday.
{15101}{15147}He then travels|faster than light
{15149}{15189}from London to New York,
{15191}{15257}where he arrives..as|physicists would confirm..
{15258}{15288}on the previous Tuesday,
{15290}{15349}Iistens to his own|broadcast on the Wednesday,
{15350}{15406}dislikes|its quality intensely,
{15407}{15474}then travels back|faster than light to London
{15476}{15558}in time for him to decide|not to give his broadcast.
{15560}{15632}Come. I'll prove it|to you logically.
{15767}{15817}Good, Cornelius,
{15818}{15855}butyou've made|a mistake here.
{15857}{15890}You have put a " B"
{15891}{15944}in place of|the second " P".
{15946}{16014}Teacher, have you|forgotten your own name?
{16063}{16140}Everyone has always called me|teacher that I had forgotten.
{16142}{16200}"Ape shall never|kill Abe."
{16202}{16236}Thank you, Cornelius.
{16238}{16287}That was a very kind thought.
{16289}{16348}Gorillas.|All right, Aldo,
{16350}{16405}Iet's start with you.
{16484}{16542}General Aldo.
{16696}{16747}With respect,|General Aldo,
{16749}{16783}this is barely legible
{16785}{16821}and will have to|be written again.
{16823}{16927}Your capital "A" Ieans over|like a tent in a high wind.
{16929}{16986}Ha ha ha!
{17036}{17082}And your capital " K"...
{17136}{17237}"Ape shall never|kill Abe."
{17239}{17288}No, Aldo! No!
{17409}{17459}Teacher!
{17461}{17518}Teacher, you've spoken|the unspeakable.
{17520}{17572}I n all ouryears|of slavery to mankind,
{17574}{17603}the word " no"|was the one word
{17605}{17644}we were electrically|conditioned to fear.
{17646}{17711}Caesar has forbidden you|its utterance in perpetuity.
{17713}{17761}An ape may say no|to a human,
{17762}{17855}but a human may never|again say no to an ape.
{17857}{17890}Tell him you're sorry,|Abe, and go home
{17892}{17927}while you've still|got a home to go to.
{17929}{17980}I'll put in a good word|foryou with Caesar.
{18129}{18216}General Aldo,|I'm sorry.
{18218}{18265}The writing you destroyed|was by Caesar's son.
{18267}{18314}I did not want you to|suffer Caesar's anger!
{18316}{18358}What do I care|for Caesar's anger?
{18360}{18418}Let me give you|a taste of mine!
{18954}{18997}Grab him!
{18999}{19048}Stop, teacher!|Grab him!
{19050}{19084}Stop!
{19266}{19324}Grab him.|Grab the teacher!
{19613}{19644}Stop!
{19646}{19671}Stop!
{19673}{19744}We'll teach the|teacher a lesson.
{19746}{19817}Throw him in the corral,|where all humans belong.
{19929}{19980}I said stop, Aldo.
{19982}{20014}He broke the law.
{20016}{20078}With his own mouth,|he broke the first law.
{20080}{20149}I am the law.|What has he done?
{20150}{20239}Caesar, I was there.
{20241}{20313}Teacher only reverted|to type under provocation.
{20314}{20390}He spoke like a slave master|in the old days of our servitude.
{20392}{20485}When we were conditioned|to mechanical obedience.
{20486}{20547}He uttered|a negative imperative.
{20549}{20597}Could you put that|into words
{20599}{20648}which even Caesar|could understand?
{20650}{20755}Um, he said,|" No, Aldo. No."
{20797}{20832}The schoolroom|was wrecked.
{20834}{20868}The class is ended.
{20870}{20907}The schoolroom|is closed!
{20909}{20948}Now we'll go back|to riding horses!
{20983}{21008}Aldo!
{21048}{21094}You and your friends
{21096}{21153}will return|to the schoolroom
{21154}{21226}and put it back|in order.
{21255}{21314}Abe, no gorilla|is to be dismissed
{21315}{21386}until everything|is back in its place.
{21387}{21422}Yes, Caesar.
{21423}{21489}Father, since there won't be|any more school today,
{21491}{21541}may I go out|and play?
{21543}{21614}Can't you study|in the house?
{21615}{21658}I could,|Father, but...
{21661}{21721}Run along and play.
{21756}{21802}Where are|my students?
{21804}{21850}I wasjust|in the midst
{21852}{21910}of explaining my theory|of time relativity.
{21912}{21967}If Caesar permits,|I would like my..
{21969}{22010}Caesar permits.
{22042}{22089}You look concerned,|MacDonald.
{22090}{22123}I am, Caesar.
{22125}{22171}I think|that Aldo's hatred
{22173}{22219}is not confined|to humans.
{22304}{22327}Look out!
{22540}{22654}I think Aldo may be|riding for a fall.
{22694}{22739}If only my mother|and father,
{22741}{22822}whom I was too|young to remember,
{22824}{22858}if only|they'd lived,
{22860}{22906}perhaps they would|have taught me
{22908}{22975}if it was right|to kill evil
{22977}{23038}so that good|should prevail.
{23040}{23110}But you know,|Caesar, history shows..
{23112}{23193}oh, no, no, no.|That is human history,
{23194}{23231}not ape history.
{23233}{23290}Ape never kills ape.
{23340}{23390}oh, here's the list
{23392}{23462}of our winter|supplies so far.
{23464}{23490}I've got to be|getting along.
{23492}{23538}I'm starving.|I could eat a horse.
{23540}{23584}A horse?
{23585}{23631}oh, you remember Lisa.
{23633}{23663}They used to eat|lots of things..
{23665}{23733}dead cattle, dead chickens,|dead pigs.
{23734}{23798}Now we live|and chew nuts
{23800}{23859}at our master's|command.
{23861}{23924}That will be all,|J ulie.
{23925}{23960}Thank you.
{23986}{24044}We are not|your masters.
{24093}{24137}We're not|your equals.
{24177}{24260}MacDonald, I believe that
{24261}{24348}when you truly grow to know|and trust a person,
{24350}{24392}you cannot help|but like him.
{24393}{24469}When we grow to know|and trust your people,
{24471}{24524}then we shall|all be equals
{24525}{24599}and remain so until|the end of the world.
{24601}{24648}Which may be sooner|than you think.
{24650}{24684}You are such a pessimist!
{24685}{24721}or a prophet.
{24722}{24779}Now that apes|are at the helm,
{24781}{24839}the Earth will sail|safely through space
{24841}{24865}until the end of time,
{24867}{24937}and Virgil says|time has no end,
{24939}{24990}so you see|I cannot believe you.
{24992}{25063}Would you believe it|if you heard it
{25065}{25141}from the lips|of your own parents?
{25169}{25223}Are my parents alive?
{25225}{25320}No, but their images|and their voices are.
{25321}{25394}MacDonald, when you talk|about my parents,
{25396}{25451}please do not speak|in riddles.
{25453}{25485}I cannot see them.|I cannot hear them.
{25487}{25534}They came out|of the future.
{25536}{25589}They cannot|give me knowledge.
{25591}{25682}Caesar,|you can see them.
{25684}{25730}You can hear them,
{25732}{25790}and they can|give you knowledge.
{25792}{25825}How?
{25826}{25898}Under the dead city|where we once lived
{25900}{25970}in the archives near|the old command post,
{25972}{26030}there are tapes..|sealed tapes..
{26032}{26077}of Cornelius and Zira
{26078}{26155}being examined by officials|of the American government.
{26157}{26201}When my brother was|Governor Breck's assistant,
{26202}{26234}he told me about them.
{26236}{26305}I know where they are,
{26307}{26353}and I know that they|concern Earth's future,
{26355}{26388}from which|your parents came.
{26389}{26442}But the city|was flattened.
{26444}{26490}The bomb left nothing.
{26492}{26546}Except, I suspect...
{26548}{26598}the archive section.
{26600}{26658}I ndeed, many sections|of the underground city
{26660}{26720}were designed|to survive the impact
{26721}{26769}of a 1 0-megaton overblast.
{26770}{26824}Well, then the tapes and|pictures of my parents..
{26825}{26888}Are still down there.
{26889}{26940}ohh...
{26942}{26989}oh, MacDonald.
{26990}{27061}I want to see|what they look like.
{27062}{27141}I suppose|every orphan does.
{27166}{27216}I want to hear
{27218}{27277}what they thought|and knew.
{27338}{27388}The city's radioactive.
{27426}{27505}oh, yeah, well...|Iet me see.
{27506}{27577}Who is there|among your people
{27578}{27637}who knows something|about radioactivity?
{27638}{27673}No one.
{27706}{27753}And among mine?
{27818}{27899}Who knows everything|about everything?
{27938}{28046}oh...|oh, Virgil.
{28048}{28100}Go find him.
{28143}{28216}Lisa, you remember|your parents.
{28218}{28305}I was too young when|they died to remember mine.
{28307}{28377}I don't want to have|to remember my husband.
{28379}{28413}I want to|love him now.
{28415}{28478}Well, Virgil|will be with us.
{28480}{28557}Now, we'll take good care.
{28559}{28593}Say good-bye|to Cornelius.
{28595}{28665}I don't want him|to know I'm afraid.
{28773}{28806}Cornelius.
{28906}{28945}Cornelius.
{29015}{29045}Cornelius.
{29123}{29145}Father.
{29195}{29241}I'm going|on a journey.
{29243}{29321}What will you|bring me back?
{29323}{29364}What would you like?
{29440}{29486}More nuts|for my squirrel.
{29488}{29522}He's growing fast.
{29524}{29570}So are you.
{29604}{29720}one day, you will be|as tall as a king.
{29861}{29887}Mandemus.
{29914}{29949}He's asleep.
{29950}{29997}Not eternally,|I trust.
{29998}{30035}Mandemus.
{30088}{30110}Who's there?
{30112}{30140}Caesar.
{30337}{30384}What does|Caesar want?
{30385}{30420}Weapons.
{30421}{30468}For what purpose?
{30469}{30504}For self-protection
{30505}{30556}in the pursuit|of knowledge.
{30558}{30605}Self-protection|against whom or what?
{30606}{30653}We don't know.
{30654}{30717}Well, then what is the point|of protecting yourself
{30719}{30782}against a danger ofwhich|you have no knowledge
{30784}{30849}in pursuit of a knowledge|you do not possess?
{30851}{30894}oh, God.
{30935}{31005}Is it a knowledge|for good or evil?
{31007}{31063}All knowledge|is for good.
{31065}{31144}only the use to which you|put it can be good or evil.
{31145}{31180}Well put.
{31181}{31207}Thank you.
{31209}{31258}The sun is rising.
{31260}{31336}I should like to get this|matter settled before it sets.
{31338}{31386}Caesar has appointed me
{31388}{31433}not only as the keeper|of this armory,
{31435}{31498}but as the keeper|of his own conscience.
{31500}{31584}That is why I have asked|six boring questions
{31585}{31633}and now propose|to ask a seventh
{31635}{31740}before issuing or not issuing|the weapons you require.
{31741}{31776}What is the nature|of the knowledge
{31777}{31849}you cannot seek|without weapons?
{31850}{31893}The knowledge of|Earth's ultimate fate
{31894}{31929}recorded on tapes
{31930}{31970}in the archives of|the forbidden city...
{31972}{32018}Which is|contaminated,
{32020}{32102}but still may be|inhabited by humans.
{32104}{32140}Hmm. Come in.
{32272}{32318}Name your|protective pick.
{32320}{32366}Three submachine guns.
{32368}{32391}For?
{32393}{32443}The removal|of obstacles.
{32446}{32483}Hmm.
{32521}{32548}1 ...
{32593}{32627}2...
{32665}{32699}3.
{32701}{32735}Now what?
{32737}{32771}Ammunition.
{32773}{32867}I really don't hold|with knowing the future,
{32869}{32939}even my own|which is short.
{32941}{32975}A geiger counter.
{32977}{33047}I mean, ifwe knew for a fact|there was an afterlife,
{33049}{33097}and that the afterlife|was bliss eternal,
{33099}{33176}we'd all commit suicide in|order to be able to enjoy it.
{33249}{33274}Pistols.
{33309}{33356}To remove|smaller obstacles?
{33358}{33417}It's a 3-dayjourney.
{33418}{33467}With Caesar's permission,|MacDonald may want to
{33469}{33524}shoot, cook,|and eat a rabbit.
{33526}{33573}But who needs|three pistols
{33574}{33621}to shoot one rabbit?
{33664}{33712}Enjoyyour meal.
{33714}{33752}Thank you.
{33814}{33897}He may be old, but he's|got a mind like a razor.
{33898}{33969}When I was a boy,|he was my teacher.
{33970}{34053}Let's collect our stores|and be on our way.
{35450}{35497}There it is...
{35498}{35536}or was.
{35538}{35650}Like a storm at sea,|but solidified.
{35652}{35740}By a bomb from an armory|1 ,000 times the size of ours.
{35742}{35807}And nobody to keep|its owner's conscience.
{36366}{36411}This is the hell
{36413}{36501}my forefathers|used to speak about.
{37728}{37793}Do you know where|we are, MacDonald?
{37795}{37830}Yes.
{37832}{37942}Now, this is..|I mean was..1 1th Avenue.
{37944}{38038}Ape Management was|2 blocks east from here.
{38040}{38099}The archives section,|2 blocks west,
{38101}{38152}corner of Breck|and Agamon.
{38153}{38184}Get us there quickly.
{39069}{39125}The governor's very|irritable lately.
{39127}{39166}Who wouldn't be,|living in this hell
{39168}{39215}of radiation|for all these years?
{39217}{39288}If the bomb hadn't|killed the old governor,
{39289}{39340}boredom certainly|would have.
{39341}{39435}Alma, I just want somebody|to talk to, anybody.
{39437}{39499}We are at best brave
{39501}{39571}and at worst mad|to be here.
{39573}{39619}This background|radiation alone
{39621}{39703}will give us|300 roentgens per hour.
{39705}{39739}Meaning?
{39741}{39835}That unless we leave|this place within 2 hours,
{39837}{39880}we shall become inmates.
{39881}{39929}This is a ghost city.
{39931}{39967}I want to put|some flesh on it.
{39969}{40015}Radioactive flesh?
{40075}{40188}Well, we're all radiated,|but at least we're active.
{40327}{40397}It's getting stronger.|We must hurry.
{40581}{40687}oh, Governor, look!|F-6! F-6!
{40785}{40827}Alert Mendez.
{40857}{40938}Mendez to control room.|Mendez to control room.
{40940}{41044}Mendez to control room.
{41045}{41132}Somebody's breached the|warning system at entry F-6.
{41133}{41168}one of our scavengers.
{41169}{41199}No. It's been|locked foryears.
{41201}{41228}It couldn't have|been one of us.
{41230}{41267}It must have|been someone else.
{41269}{41319}Well, that's impossible.|There is no one else.
{41321}{41369}We must act quickly.
{41371}{41416}- Alma.|- Yes, sir?
{41417}{41473}Work the B console.
{41475}{41548}Quick, Mendez. Quick! Quick!
{41550}{41625}oh, quicker! Faster!
{41792}{41832}Keep going.
{41833}{41871}No, no. Back.
{41942}{41991}This is the place.
{42109}{42179}That's Caesar,
{42181}{42263}come back to reconquer|his kingdom.
{42265}{42347}Doesn't he know that|the bomb did that?
{42644}{42690}We're still all right.
{42692}{42732}This way.
{42803}{42842}Quicker!
{42844}{42875}Quicker!
{42913}{42964}There. Hold it.
{42966}{43040}Can anything live|down here for long?
{43042}{43076}oh, yes.
{43078}{43126}But in the end,|not recognizably.
{43126}{43142}But in the end,|not recognizably.
{43144}{43209}The black man|is the brother
{43211}{43311}of my predecessor's|personal assistant.
{43313}{43370}He supervised|the archives.
{43371}{43456}I don't think|I know the orangutan.
{43672}{43706}Look!
{43708}{43754}It's been there foryears.
{43755}{43833}The late governor had this whole|place equipped with cameras
{43835}{43912}to forestall ape conspiracies,|as I remember.
{43914}{43952}Hmm.
{43954}{43981}Archives.
{43983}{44054}We haven't been in|there since, uh...
{44055}{44123}I wonder what the devil|they want in there.
{44154}{44195}We'll find the tape|that we're looking for
{44197}{44273}under the heading of|" Presidential Commission."
{44608}{44683}" Proceedings of the|Presidential Commission
{44685}{44728}on Alien Visitors,
{44730}{44781}1 973."
{44823}{44865}Is this it?
{44867}{44893}Let's see.
{44895}{44926}Yes, that's it.
{44928}{44967}Now, if this thing works,
{44969}{44998}the picture should come out
{45000}{45046}on that screen over there.
{45228}{45276}All security forces, alert.
{45278}{45327}All security forces, alert.
{45329}{45399}Check out all sections|in areas M-5.
{45401}{45471}Apprehend 3 strangers|you will find there:
{45473}{45530}one human and two apes.
{45531}{45602}But caution.|I repeat, caution.
{45603}{45668}If they resist,|you may shoot,
{45670}{45721}but shoot to maim.
{45722}{45766}We want them alive|for interrogation.
{45768}{45877}Ifwe shoot, we break|1 2 years of peace.
{45966}{46022}Yes, it has been rather|boring, hasn't it?
{46118}{46149}My mother.
{46150}{46193}Who wonyour war?
{46195}{46242}It wasn't our war.
{46243}{46317}It was thegorillas' war.
{46319}{46390}What didthespaceship's|date meterread
{46391}{46443}af terEarth's|destruction?
{46445}{46522}3950.
{46524}{46601}And you talk to your pupils
{46603}{46642}about eternity.
{46679}{46725}There are only 3.
{46726}{46792}There must be more,|but how many?
{46794}{46873}We'll know|when we get them.
{46874}{46932}My father.
{46966}{47010}That's my father.
{47011}{47071}Howdidapesfirstacquire|thepowerofspeech?
{47073}{47115}Theylearnedto refuse.
{47117}{47189}On a historic day,|an apespoke a word
{47191}{47278}which hadbeenspoken|to him byhumans.
{47280}{47318}Hesaid, "no. "
{47482}{47550}No wonder all of mankind|thirsted for my blood
{47551}{47594}and wanted|my birth aborted.
{47596}{47677}I n the year 3950,|apes will destroy Earth.
{47678}{47734}Not apes, gorillas.
{47736}{47785}Besides, that's|only one future.
{47787}{47851}How can there be|more than one?
{47853}{47913}You remember|the old motorways?
{47914}{47987}I believe that time is like|an endless motorway
{47989}{48087}with an infinite number of lanes all|running from the past into the future.
{48089}{48191}A driver could|change his lanes
{48193}{48238}and change|his future.
{48240}{48319}If you left|this room right now,
{48321}{48385}you might|wind up shot dead.
{48387}{48415}If you left|a minute later,
{48417}{48457}you might survive.
{48458}{48521}It's a blind choice,
{48522}{48616}but you can|change lanes.
{48618}{48712}I know what it is|I want to change.
{49045}{49105}The camera. It moved.
{49107}{49168}Are you sure?
{49170}{49231}Virgil's right.
{49285}{49349}Governor, wejust|lost the TV monitor.
{49351}{49422}I'm not interested|in equipment failures.
{49423}{49506}It wasn't a failure.|It was destroyed, sir.
{50046}{50114}We've got to find|another way out of here.
{50116}{50150}Is there|another way?
{50268}{50338}They got past you?|Then shoot on sight.
{50340}{50386}Never mind about|bringing them here.
{50388}{50417}J ust get them.
{50418}{50484}Don't let anyone|escape alive!
{50486}{50586}Sections 2-5|and R-7 and 8,
{50588}{50626}form a group here.|Quick! Quick!
{50628}{50671}All right, move out!
{50673}{50730}Move! Move! Move!
{50732}{50766}Hurry!
{50768}{50802}Run!
{50804}{50838}Run!
{50890}{50949}I've got your guns.
{50950}{50997}We need another patrol.
{50998}{51032}Quickly, men.|Hurry. Hurry.
{51034}{51105}The rest of you go|to M-5.
{51106}{51158}What are you|waiting for?
{51160}{51237}To R-8,|through the transverse!
{51838}{51876}Aah!
{52948}{53014}All forces|into exit level 3.
{53016}{53081}They're getting away!|Kill them!
{53083}{53145}Kill them! Kill them!
{57583}{57697}You knew every bolt and nut|in those corridors.
{57699}{57793}You have 100 armed men.|How could they escape?
{57794}{57868}They were fast|and smart, Governor Kolp.
{57870}{57908}Many of my men|were sick,
{57910}{57966}and the chimp|surprised us.
{57968}{58045}Yeah. He surprised|me too, once,
{58047}{58113}But he's an animal.|He's only an animal.
{58115}{58137}No, Governor.
{58139}{58171}He's more|than an animal.
{58173}{58208}He can speak.
{58210}{58236}So can they all.
{58237}{58286}So speech|makes them human?
{58288}{58338}Speech makes them|intelligent,
{58340}{58421}and intelligence may make them|not human, but humane.
{58423}{58457}Perhaps they|came in peace.
{58458}{58493}Idiot.|They were armed.
{58494}{58529}From what we saw|on the monitor,
{58530}{58577}only for their|self-protection.
{58578}{58631}Let them|return in peace.
{58633}{58660}To where?
{58662}{58694}To wherever they live.
{58696}{58760}So they can return to|exterminate those of us
{58762}{58809}the bomb hasn't|already exterminated?
{58810}{58839}Where do they live?
{58841}{58892}They came with|few provisions.
{58894}{58923}It can't be far.
{58925}{58952}Which way|did they head?
{58953}{58993}They headed north,|Governor.
{58995}{59029}organize|scout parties,
{59030}{59078}assemble|workable equipment,
{59080}{59117}and follow them|to their camp.
{59119}{59189}Yes, Governor Kolp.
{59191}{59274}Why, Governor?
{59276}{59359}So that we|can exterminate them.
{59517}{59564}Stop!|It's Caesar!
{59565}{59644}We should have|stayed in the city.
{59645}{59688}Visiting the city|is forbidden.
{59689}{59749}I know.|I forbade it.
{59750}{59779}Then why?
{59781}{59844}Aldo, if a king forbids his|subjects to wear a crown,
{59846}{59895}that doesn't mean|he can't wear one himself.
{59897}{59928}Caesar is Caesar.
{59930}{59981}He went to the city|for a reason.
{59983}{60032}What reason?
{60033}{60080}I went looking|for my past,
{60081}{60152}but I found our future.
{60153}{60188}Explain!
{60189}{60248}You wouldn't understand.
{60249}{60332}Aldo will make|the future..with this!
{60333}{60416}Well, then Aldo|may very soon
{60417}{60472}be in the past.
{60474}{60519}Hee hee.
{60521}{60555}Hee hee.
{60557}{60591}Hee hee.
{60645}{60717}Aah!
{60917}{60951}Cornelius!
{60989}{61055}Cornelius,|are you all right?
{61085}{61140}No, Mother.|I'm just dead.
{61141}{61186}Dead?
{61188}{61217}We were playing war.
{61219}{61265}War? Cornelius,|hasn't your father explained
{61267}{61325}that war is not a game?
{61327}{61374}Yes, Mother.
{61376}{61435}Hasn't he also forbidden|you to play with guns?
{61437}{61471}Yes, Mother.
{61473}{61516}Then you'll stop it.
{61517}{61552}Yes, Mother.
{61553}{61612}Now, come along.|Father wants us.
{63582}{63665}My friends,|I have convened
{63667}{63732}this extraordinary meeting|of the council
{63734}{63775}in order that I may|report upon an action
{63777}{63852}which I deemed necessary:
{63854}{63932}a reconnaissance expedition|to the forbidden city
{63934}{64012}with Virgil and MacDonald|as my aides.
{64014}{64077}Why MacDonald?|Why not a soldier?
{64079}{64132}Because we went in peace
{64133}{64185}to what we thought|would be a dead city.
{64187}{64240}But in case|there were some survivors,
{64242}{64275}we took MacDonald with us
{64277}{64316}so that he could parley|with them
{64317}{64386}and secure permission|for our search.
{64388}{64430}Survivors there are...
{64432}{64472}maimed,
{64474}{64522}mutated,
{64524}{64572}hostile,
{64574}{64619}and human.
{64621}{64665}Did the humans|followyou here?
{64667}{64699}We saw no sign of it,
{64701}{64749}but we must prepare|for the day
{64751}{64784}when they may|come out of the city,
{64788}{64850}when they may come|to find us.
{64968}{65059}No humans in council!|No humans in council!
{65060}{65098}- No!|- No!|- No!
{65100}{65133}- No!|- No!
{65135}{65167}- No!|- No!|- No!
{65168}{65215}- No!|- No!
{65216}{65263}- No!|- No!
{65264}{65311}- No!|- No!
{65312}{65378}- No!|- No!|- No!
{65380}{65406}Yes!
{65408}{65459}They are here|because I sent for them.
{65460}{65511}Now that we know the danger,
{65513}{65560}we need their help|and their counsel.
{65562}{65616}- No!|- No!|- No!
{65618}{65654}Yes!
{65656}{65781}Come. We shall not sit|in council with humans.
{66083}{66168}Now, let us|reason together
{66170}{66234}and make plans.
{66236}{66284}Governor, somewhere|along the line of history,
{66286}{66357}this bloody chain reaction|has got to stop.
{66359}{66438}A destroys B, B destroys C,|C destroys A
{66440}{66503}and is destroyed|by D, who destroys E.
{66505}{66557}Before anyone knows|where they are,
{66559}{66616}there won't be anyone left|to know anything anywhere.
{66618}{66691}Governor, the captain|has come back.
{66692}{66771}We found it, Governor.|We found Ape City.
{66772}{66796}Where?
{66869}{66928}This is|a gorilla outpost.
{66929}{66976}Below is a valley|with orchards and vineyards,
{66977}{67003}enough to feed hundreds.
{67005}{67031}Here is Ape City.
{67033}{67068}Was it very large?
{67069}{67107}It is of a size we|can deal with, sir.
{67109}{67135}Were you seen?
{67137}{67161}No, sir.
{67163}{67215}Caesar was too busy|with a council ofwar.
{67217}{67264}one day soon, they'll|be coming for us.
{67265}{67312}No. We're going|after them..now.
{67313}{67346}Captain, you|have your orders.
{67373}{67456}Caesar, on the night|of the fires,
{67457}{67521}you swore an oath|that in the future
{67523}{67611}apes and humans would live|together in kindness and peace.
{67613}{67691}Why are you now making|every sort of preparation
{67693}{67716}to break that oath?
{67717}{67797}Because unlike|the humans in our city,
{67799}{67935}those in the|forbidden city are mad..
{67936}{68023}mad enough not to want|peace and friendship,
{68025}{68082}but enmity and war.
{68084}{68137}Did they tell you that?
{68139}{68171}oh, yes. Yes.
{68172}{68219}By opening fire on us
{68220}{68257}without giving us|a chance to explain.
{68259}{68321}You were trespassing|on their territory.
{68323}{68393}But, Lisa, we didn't know|the city was inhabited.
{68395}{68483}But how, if you|didn't speak to them,
{68485}{68547}do you know its|inhabitants are mad?
{68548}{68609}Lisa, you|didn't see them.
{68611}{68713}They're...oh...|They're malformed.
{68715}{68796}Like the freaks in your|foster father's circus?
{68798}{68832}Were they mad?
{68834}{68869}What's malformed?
{68871}{68917}Cornelius, go to bed.
{68919}{68977}I'm giving|Riki his water.
{68979}{69076}Lisa, freaks|are different.
{69078}{69159}These humans are|the end product
{69161}{69205}of nuclear radiation.
{69238}{69351}They are mutant,|and they're mad.
{69412}{69461}Keep all emergency|channels open.
{69463}{69510}Yes, Governor. All emergency|channels will remain open.
{69512}{69570}If anything|should miscarry,
{69572}{69630}I'll signal you|as arranged.
{69632}{69670}Yes, sir.
{69672}{69727}Hurry, man.|We need it!
{69886}{69956}The school bus will be|operational, Governor.
{69957}{69985}The rest of the convoy
{69987}{70022}will join us|atjunction C.
{70024}{70067}Get moving.
{71312}{71346}Riki!
{72008}{72041}Well...
{72043}{72102}they have guns.
{72104}{72150}We have no guns.
{72152}{72216}We shall take the guns,
{72218}{72280}and we shall beat them.
{72486}{72545}We are the elite.
{72547}{72592}We are the super-race.
{72594}{72664}We have|the right to lead.
{72666}{72756}Without us,|there would be no army.
{73137}{73220}We need power, guns!
{73305}{73384}We need power!
{73386}{73477}Guns! Guns.
{73479}{73526}Guns are power!
{73528}{73592}We shall get them,
{73594}{73656}and we'll beat them|with guns.
{73658}{73711}We will smash|the humans.
{73764}{73802}All humans!
{73804}{73903}And then we will|smash Caesar!
{74020}{74062}Hmm?
{74188}{74223}Look!
{74356}{74396}It's Caesar's son.
{74398}{74474}And he overheard|every word we said.
{74535}{74624}Cornelius, come down.
{74676}{74751}Come down, or else.
{76222}{76257}Father!
{76341}{76375}Cornelius?
{76503}{76560}Mother!
{76562}{76597}Aah!
{76788}{76834}Grrr!
{77486}{77521}Cornelius!
{78419}{78465}I only heard about it|this morning.
{78467}{78501}His squirrel is missing.
{78503}{78573}He must have been|looking for it.
{78575}{78621}How is Cornelius?
{78623}{78669}Hurt. He's badly hurt.
{79930}{79964}oh!
{80015}{80049}oh!
{80929}{80975}Speak the truth.
{81137}{81207}Even ifwe had|a hospital...
{81333}{81427}I'm not going to|tell Caesar, notyet.
{81429}{81536}He still believes|he can change the future.
{81888}{82019}Humans, going|towards our city.
{82103}{82154}I'll get him.
{82265}{82296}Aah!
{82883}{82923}Get ready to fire.
{82925}{82948}Fire!
{83787}{83856}The doctor|is doing her best.
{83858}{83928}I don't believe|Cornelius can live.
{83930}{83964}Caesar does.
{83966}{84034}He refuses|to leave his side.
{84036}{84070}MacDonald, how can|a benevolent God
{84072}{84112}allow a branch|of his own tree
{84114}{84165}to crack and injure|an innocent child?
{84166}{84274}It didn't crack, Virgil.|It was cut.
{84276}{84360}order at council!|order! order!
{84362}{84412}The humans|are attacking.
{84414}{84504}They've killed one gorilla|and wounded another.
{84506}{84531}Tell them.
{84533}{84605}We were scouting|desert approaches to the city
{84607}{84648}and saw their army.
{84650}{84760}They fired.|My companion was killed.
{84762}{84801}I have come|to warn you.
{84802}{84855}And how long before|they get here?
{84857}{84879}Soon.
{84881}{84929}So now,|we must prepare.
{84931}{84959}Take the humans out.
{84961}{85001}Lock them all|in the corral.
{85003}{85075}Aldo! Aldo,|you can't do this!
{85077}{85147}You're acting against|Caesar's orders.
{85175}{85237}Caesar is not here.
{85598}{85645}Hey! What the..
{85646}{85681}Hey!
{85766}{85805}Jake.
{85806}{85885}Strongman, take him|to the corral.
{85942}{85994}Take all humans|to the corral.
{86060}{86130}Take all humans|to the corral.
{86247}{86334}All humans, take them|to the corral.
{86511}{86558}Where are you going?
{86559}{86618}Martial law|has been declared.
{86619}{86666}Everybody is to stay|in their homes.
{86667}{86702}By whose orders?
{86703}{86749}Go home!
{86830}{86984}We want guns!|Guns are power.
{86986}{87051}Now we go and get guns!
{87053}{87089}Mandemus.
{87090}{87129}Who's there?
{87130}{87177}Aldo.|General Aldo.
{87226}{87261}What do you want?
{87262}{87309}Guns! Guns!
{87310}{87381}What will you do|with them?
{87382}{87453}We shall do with them|what we will.
{87454}{87485}" Do what you will"|is the devil's law.
{87486}{87549}And who are you,|Mandemus, God?
{87550}{87596}I am the keeper|of Caesar's conscience.
{87598}{87644}And I am the keeper|of Caesar's army!
{87646}{87680}Under allegiance to Caesar!
{87682}{87716}Where is he?
{87718}{87748}Mandemus,|as I speak,
{87750}{87804}our city is being|attacked by humans
{87806}{87832}from without|and within.
{87834}{87872}Who cares|where Caesar is?
{87874}{87896}I care!
{87898}{87932}There is a law|that weapons
{87934}{87968}may only be issued|from this armory
{87970}{88016}under direct orders|from Caesar
{88018}{88047}and not under threats
{88049}{88100}from one of his|thicker-headed subordinates
{88102}{88173}for whom war means|only personal glory.
{88174}{88257}Now, find me Caesar.|I will listen to him.
{88258}{88313}First,|listen to this.
{88417}{88467}Take every gun|in the place, everything.
{88469}{88506}Get the ammo boxes.
{88508}{88571}Get the handguns,|grenades.
{88573}{88646}Stop! Stop!|Caesar forbids you!
{88648}{88686}Ah!
{88964}{89034}Well, there it is:|Ape City.
{89036}{89063}When we leave,
{89065}{89134}I don't want to see|one tree left standing,
{89136}{89170}2 pieces ofwood|nailed together,
{89172}{89214}or anything left alive.
{89216}{89323}I want it to look like|that city we came from.
{89367}{89454}What the devil is all|that rubbish down there?
{89456}{89509}It looks like some sort|of barricade, sir.
{89510}{89583}Nothing that a couple of|flame bombs won't take care of.
{89934}{89965}Caesar, forgive me,
{89966}{90019}but I couldn't|get here before now.
{90021}{90053}Aldo has seized power.
{90054}{90097}He's broken|into the armory
{90099}{90161}and imprisoned all|humans in the corral.
{90162}{90209}MacDonald?
{90210}{90234}He was dragged from|the council meeting
{90236}{90272}by Aldo's gorillas.
{90326}{90389}I can't leave|Cornelius.
{90390}{90417}He needs me.
{90418}{90521}Every ape and human|in Ape City needs you now.
{90522}{90599}I think you should go|to Cornelius.
{90820}{90860}Father?
{90862}{90974}They...hurt me.
{91032}{91142}They want...to hurt you.
{91214}{91266}Who hurt you?
{91268}{91305}The humans?
{91358}{91393}No.
{91430}{91472}Then who?
{91475}{91523}Sh...
{91569}{91631}Shall...
{91633}{91692}Shall I be...
{91693}{91748}malformed?
{91825}{91860}No.
{91933}{92033}one day|you are going to be
{92035}{92104}as tall as a king.
{93437}{93508}All right, Captain,|lay the smoke screen.
{93509}{93580}When I give the signal,|start the bombardment.
{93581}{93653}Men and equipment|out of the bus.
{93655}{93701}Deployyour weapons,|quickly!
{93736}{93795}All is|in order, sir.
{93796}{93843}All right. Let's go.
{94185}{94259}He said|they hurt him.
{94260}{94343}Who?|Who would hurt him?
{94380}{94451}I think you'll|have your answer,
{94452}{94499}and soon.
{94560}{94611}What do you know?
{94613}{94657}That's what I know.
{95326}{95370}You did this.
{95372}{95406}For security.
{95408}{95490}Did you also raid the armory|for the same reason?
{95492}{95529}For security!
{95531}{95575}Caesar, Caesar!
{95612}{95659}I orderyou|to stop this!
{95660}{95707}I orderyou|to stop it now
{95708}{95752}and release|those people!
{95890}{95972}See? Aldo was right.|War has come.
{95973}{96008}Let's go.
{96270}{96331}Aah! Aah! Aah!
{96772}{96850}Go to the barricade!|To the barricade!
{97466}{97500}Come on!
{97502}{97536}Go to the barricade!
{99261}{99327}They're laying|a smoke screen.
{99592}{99638}Here they come.
{100301}{100335}Where's Aldo?
{100337}{100424}Probably the other side|of the valley by now.
{101145}{101210}Hurry! Fall back,|fall back!
{101249}{101326}Fall back.|Go back to the village.
{101432}{101523}Get away from the fire!|Fall back! Hurry!
{101525}{101573}Leave the barricade!
{101575}{101698}Fall back! Fall back!|Get back to the village.
{103091}{103181}Nothing left alive!
{103183}{103263}You can't stay here|any longer.
{103265}{103331}You must|save yourself.
{105040}{105072}Ah!
{105262}{105302}Caesar.
{105427}{105482}Your people|weakened our city
{105484}{105548}by rebelling against|your human masters.
{105550}{105667}But we who survive|will create a new race,
{105669}{105732}and you and yours|will be brought low,
{105734}{105839}and you shall|learn again
{105841}{105920}what it is to have a master.
{105921}{105954}Ha!
{105956}{106045}You're learning|already...
{106047}{106128}clever ape.
{106199}{106235}oh, no.
{106273}{106317}Ape.
{106319}{106376}Clever ape.
{106413}{106494}But then,|you always were clever.
{106496}{106587}I was told how|you chose your own name.
{106589}{106660}But every Caesar|must have his Brutus.
{106662}{106692}Did you know that, ape?
{106694}{106764}Do you|understand that, ape?
{106765}{106889}And now Ape City is|about to lose its king.
{106928}{106956}No, Kolp! No!
{107087}{107132}Now fight like apes!
{107959}{108011}Stop! Stop. No killing.
{108013}{108055}Take them captive.
{108250}{108285}Get moving!
{108338}{108403}No, no!|Don't kill them.
{108405}{108454}Take them prisoner.
{108680}{108714}No.
{108740}{108782}No, Virgil.
{109100}{109221}All right, Virgil.|Let's go.
{109350}{109437}No prisoners.|No prisoners!
{109748}{109786}Dismount.
{110390}{110425}Hail Caesar!
{110426}{110477}Hail Caesar!
{110478}{110530}Hail Caesar!
{110532}{110568}Hail Caesar!
{110570}{110626}Hail Caesar!
{110628}{110664}Caesar!
{110666}{110722}Caesar!
{110724}{110773}Caesar!
{110774}{110809}Caesar!
{110810}{110844}Caesar!
{110846}{110873}Caesar!
{110875}{110922}Caesar!
{110924}{110977}Caesar!
{110978}{111037}We've done it!
{111038}{111085}Hold!
{111086}{111151}Let the humans go,|Virgil, all of them.
{111153}{111181}No!
{111557}{111592}They stay.
{111594}{111654}Aldo says what we do now.
{111655}{111716}They have done nothing.|They shall go free.
{111718}{111763}You like humans?
{111765}{111810}You want them|out of the corral?
{111812}{111865}All right. Kill them!
{111866}{111901}Aah!
{111902}{111929}Kill them.
{111931}{111994}Kill them all.
{112028}{112061}Stop.
{112062}{112098}Stop.
{112100}{112190}No more killing, Aldo.|Put down your weapons.
{112192}{112242}Take them back|to the armory.
{112244}{112271}No! We shall|keep the guns!
{112273}{112355}Move, Caesar,|or we shall kill you.
{112919}{112990}Ape has never|killed ape,
{112991}{113062}Iet alone|an ape child.
{113323}{113390}Aldo has killed|an ape child.
{113392}{113450}The branch|did not break.
{113452}{113522}It was cut...|with a sword.
{114086}{114128}Aldo.
{114162}{114233}You...you killed.
{114310}{114383}Aldo killed.
{114430}{114547}Aldo has broken|our most sacred law.
{114618}{114664}our child.
{114690}{114739}He killed our child.
{114741}{114788}What's the matter|with them?
{114790}{114895}I guess you might say they|justjoined the human race.
{114897}{114956}Ape has killed ape.
{114958}{115016}Ape has killed ape.
{115018}{115097}Ape has killed ape.
{115099}{115160}Ape has killed ape.
{115162}{115217}Ape has killed ape.
{115219}{115276}Ape has killed ape.
{115278}{115351}Ape has killed ape.
{115353}{115394}Ape has killed ape.
{115396}{115474}Ape has killed ape.
{115476}{115523}Ape has killed ape.
{115525}{115602}Ape has killed ape.
{115604}{115660}Ape has killed ape.
{115662}{115725}Ape has killed ape.
{115727}{115798}Ape has killed ape.
{115799}{115857}Ape has killed ape.
{115858}{115915}Ape has killed ape.
{115917}{115985}Ape has killed ape.
{115986}{116046}Ape has killed ape.
{116047}{116106}Ape has killed ape.
{116107}{116171}Ape has killed ape.
{116173}{116234}Ape has killed ape.
{116236}{116294}Ape has killed ape.
{116296}{116362}Ape has killed ape.
{116364}{116424}Ape has killed ape.
{116426}{116500}Ape has killed ape.
{116502}{116553}Ape has killed ape.
{116554}{116611}Ape has killed ape.
{117795}{117858}You murdered my son.
{117860}{117929}You murdered my son.
{117931}{117990}You murdered my son!
{118850}{118932}Should one murder|be avenged by another?
{118934}{118992}only the future|can tell.
{118994}{119066}So let us|start building it.
{119716}{119788}Ifwe appear to be lacking|in gratitude, Caesar,
{119790}{119860}what have we|to be grateful for?
{119862}{119898}If you mean|to set us free,
{119900}{119947}then free us|completely.
{119949}{119984}What do you mean?
{119986}{120062}We are not|your children, Caesar.
{120064}{120109}We have a destiny, too..
{120111}{120170}as equals,|respecting each other,
{120172}{120213}Iiving together,|with love.
{120215}{120266}Love?
{120268}{120383}The human way|is violence and death.
{120384}{120495}Aldo wasn't human,|was he, Caesar?
{120554}{120591}Virgil...
{120629}{120727}you are|a good and wise ape.
{120820}{120932}And you, Caesar, are|a good and wise king.
{120934}{121024}We'll rebuild what's ruined|and begin again.
{121026}{121072}Tell me something,|MacDonald.
{121074}{121168}Can we make the future|what we wish?
{121170}{121240}I've heard that|it's possible, Caesar.
{121399}{121516}There. Every weapon|is back in its proper place.
{121518}{121593}Caesar, I want|to ask a favor.
{121595}{121655}This armory's been|my home for 27 years.
{121657}{121709}You may live in it for|the rest of your days.
{121711}{121760}But I don't want|to live in it.
{121762}{121834}No, no. Now that|the danger is over,
{121836}{121923}I want to see it|destroyed. Blown up.
{121925}{122040}The greatest danger of all|is that danger never ends.
{122042}{122124}And so, Mandemus,
{122126}{122212}we must be patient...|and wait.
{122244}{122335}We still wait,|my children.
{122336}{122411}But as I look at|apes and humans
{122412}{122529}Iiving in friendship,|harmony, and at peace
{122531}{122621}now some 600 years|after Caesar's death,
{122623}{122700}at least we wait|with hope for the future.
{122702}{122775}Lawgiver, who knows|about the future?
{122832}{122911}Perhaps only the dead.
