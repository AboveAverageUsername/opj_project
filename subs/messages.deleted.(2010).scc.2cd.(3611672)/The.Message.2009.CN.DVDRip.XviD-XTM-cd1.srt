00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,738
CHINA, DURING THS
SINO-JAPANESE WAR

3
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,538
A BITTER POWER STRUGGLE TEARS
THE COUNTRY APART

4
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,538
VICE PRESIDENT WANG DECLARES
A NEW GOVERNMENT

5
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,238
BACKED BY THE INVADING
JAPANESE ARMY

6
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,838
THIS PUPPET REGIME TRIES TO LURE
AWAY OFFICIALS

7
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,938
FROM CHIANG KAI-SHEK'S CAMP

8
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,538
TO FURTHER GAIN FAVOR WITH
HIS JAPANESE MASTERS

9
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,038
WANG BRUTALLY CLAMPS DOWN
THE RESISTANCE

10
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,738
THAT SEEKS TO RETURN CHINA
TO THE CHINESE

11
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,338
AS THE PUPPET REGIME GROWS
MORE TYRANNICAL

12
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,038
THE RESISTANCE COUNTERS WITH
INCREASINGLY BLOODY ASSASSINATIONS

13
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:30,038
THE MESSAGE

14
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:57,591
OCTOBER 10, 1942 THE NATIONAL
HOLIDAY

15
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,438
Sorry,

16
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,909
We're closed tonight.

17
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,435
How come?
We're trying to celebrate.

18
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,119
The whole restaurant's booked.

19
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,793
Got it?!

20
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,034
Even General Tang has joined us.

21
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,879
And he's not the only one,
of course.

22
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,191
You know,

23
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
General He...

24
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,956
and the rest of them.

25
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,953
We're beating back Chiang Kai-Shek
and his men in every battle.

26
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,239
His government won't be able
to hold out much longer.

27
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,230
President Wang holds you
in the highest esteem.

28
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,909
He sent me here to invite you,

29
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,239
to join him on the viewing
platform at the ceremony.

30
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,475
He would be most honored,

31
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,518
even if you're only there briefly.

32
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,155
President Wang needs the

33
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,510
support of people like you.

34
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,431
Go ahead.

35
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,477
The Chungking style chicken
here is the genuine article.

36
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,593
You've been holed up in the
North too long. Have a taste.

37
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,073
Mr Fan...

38
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,871
I need your answer now.

39
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,348
Smells nice...

40
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,838
Doesn't it?

41
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,639
It comes from Sri Lanka.

42
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,313
Drives our Puppy crazy.

43
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,195
Now tell me--cause
you'll sooner or later.

44
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,713
Who do you get
your orders from?

45
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,671
Puppy..

46
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,716
Go!

47
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,635
Colonel Takeda.

48
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,076
You must be Mr Six.

49
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,669
I'm a great admirer of your work.

50
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,878
You're too kind.

51
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,510
Col. Takeda has a remarkable
command of Chinese.

52
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,029
She's a tough one.

53
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,395
We've tried everything
at our disposal.

54
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,709
She won't break.

55
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,268
Then Mr Six is the
man for the job.

56
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,669
Don't let me keep you.

57
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,797
Just turn these
assassinations over...

58
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,032
to the Chinese authorities.

59
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,830
You'll be sent back to the
Home Islands soon enough.

60
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,598
Don't get mixed up in all this.

61
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,637
Gen. Tsukeda, sir--

62
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,392
The head of the Resistance...

63
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,636
is a man code-named Magnum.

64
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,273
Though he's never
exposed himself,

65
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,549
he's behind these
assassinations.

66
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,472
I've got a strong feeling that

67
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,352
Magnum has a mole in
our operations.

68
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,158
Feelings are for women, Takeda.

69
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,595
Feelings don't have
any place in war.

70
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,119
My part in the war is
almost over, sir.

71
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,799
This would be my last
chance to redeem myself.

72
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,469
I can't return home as a failure.
It would bring shame to my family.

73
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,358
That woman finally cracked.

74
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,511
She's with Magnum alright.

75
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,075
She says they get their orders,

76
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,158
from a message board

77
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,793
in front of the city temple.

78
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,675
The orders are written
on a lottery flyer.

79
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,833
That sounds like their M.O.

80
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,032
We found this in her home.

81
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,435
Has she ever met the
person who posts the flyers?

82
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,710
She bumped into him once.

83
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,389
He's an old cripple.

84
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,556
Commissioner, I've seen
the cripple before.

85
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,711
He's a janitor at the
Counter-Insurgency Center.

86
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,676
- Retreat!
- Yes, sir.

87
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,276
Mission abort!

88
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,350
Mission abort!

89
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,311
You did the right thing.

90
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,517
If you'd taken him in,

91
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,190
we'd have lost our only lead.

92
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,958
If the person who
posts the flyers,

93
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,758
ia a janitor at our
Counter-Insurgency Center,

94
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,958
then we can also presume...

95
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,475
that he's getting his information

96
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,071
from someone else working at the
Counter-Insurgency Center.

97
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,630
Correct!

98
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,396
Our sources say their
codename is Phantom.

99
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,949
The next move is ours.

100
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:48,201
Li Ningyu, Head Officer of
the Decoding Section.

101
00:12:55,615 --> 00:12:58,189
Gu Xiaomeng, Administration Officer
of the Decoding Section.

102
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,434
Sir!

103
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,471
Okay.

104
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:04,856
Hello...

105
00:13:08,044 --> 00:13:10,651
Wu Zhiguo, Chief Captain of
Counter-Insurgency.

106
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,678
I understood.

107
00:13:18,685 --> 00:13:22,850
Jin Shenghuo, Section
Chief of the Military Office.

108
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,953
Greetings!

109
00:13:34,934 --> 00:13:35,870
Bai Xiaonian, Aide to the
Commander of Counter-Insurgency.

110
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,199
For the Commander.

111
00:13:52,224 --> 00:13:55,183
CITY TEMPLE, TWO DAYS LATER

112
00:14:09,902 --> 00:14:12,430
Takeda et al to gather
at Bai Cao Hall on October 31.

113
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,049
Request assassination
plan from Magnum.

114
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,474
Please hold on.

115
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,276
Moving now.

116
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,110
We have to go.

117
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,719
- Now?
- Yes!

118
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,718
Where the hell are we?

119
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,870
Spooky...

120
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,433
It used to be called Qiu Manor.

121
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,159
The Japanese have
taken over it now...

122
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,628
Turned it into their own
little pleasure palace.

123
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,995
High ranking officers only.

124
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,391
Looks like this is serious matter.

125
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,753
And someone's...

126
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,753
going to be in for it.

127
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,910
What makes you say that?

128
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,157
Didn't you see? The Chief of
Special Services is here too.

129
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,635
Chief Wang.

130
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,756
Good evening, everyone.

131
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,432
May I suggest that you go to
your rooms and freshen up first?

132
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,472
We'll meet in the conference
room in half an hour.

133
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,516
What do you mean, freshen up?

134
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,356
Let's just get the
meeting over with,

135
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,515
so that we can all go home.

136
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,069
Patience, Ms Gu!

137
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,874
Just go to your room first.

138
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,554
If you would.

139
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,315
All right.

140
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,429
Lieutenant Bai--

141
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,271
That room.

142
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,309
Chief Jin--

143
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,151
This way.

144
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,072
Chief Captain Wu--

145
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,554
That way.

146
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,918
Where's ours?

147
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,549
I'm still feeling sick.

148
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,190
Fairy shed light on
heaven's secrets.

149
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,868
Win every time with
White Dove lottery tickets.

150
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,637
3-6-4-4-5-6-0-2...

151
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,955
What is this all about?

152
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,679
Total gibberish.

153
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,590
The Imperial Army

154
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,957
intercepted this coded
message this afternoon.

155
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,034
At first glance, nothing more
than an ad for the lottery.

156
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,788
But according to
our intelligence

157
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,878
it contains a message from
an underground organization.

158
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,230
Regarding a new wave
of assassinations.

159
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,354
We've asked all of
you here to

160
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,315
help us crack the code,

161
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,635
before it's too late.

162
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,431
You must be joking.

163
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,516
None of us here
are cryptographers,

164
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,552
except for Officer Li.

165
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,710
What did you bring us here for?

166
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,517
To play mahjong?

167
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,949
Officer Bai, this order came directly...

168
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,876
from the upper levels
of the Japanese Army.

169
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,913
It would be best if
everyone cooperated fully.

170
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,031
Does Commander Zhang
know about this?

171
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,197
No!

172
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,312
The commander is in Nanking
on business

173
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,153
until the day after tomorrow.

174
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,430
All these numbers...

175
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:54,917
Don't look at me.

176
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,798
I don't know anything about codes.

177
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,949
What about you?

178
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,673
Not in my area of interest.

179
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,036
I specialize more in blackjack,
mahjong...

180
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,668
that kind of thing.

181
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,548
Li?

182
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,556
Li!

183
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,876
You're the expert here.

184
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,557
What do you say?

185
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,152
It's no good.

186
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,470
We can't crack it.

187
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,676
These numbers

188
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,832
have obviously been encrypted.

189
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,838
There're 18 characters in total.

190
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,600
To decode what they're meant
to be, we'd need the codebook.

191
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,711
Otherwise...

192
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,598
we could be here for days
and still come up with nothing.

193
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,716
Did you hear that?

194
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,036
Go tell the Japanese,

195
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,551
we can't help them.

196
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,471
I want to go home.

197
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,109
I don't have time
for this nonsense.

198
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,589
I've got a sweep to go
out on tomorrow.

199
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,910
Col. Takeda...

200
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,595
Who's that?

201
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,868
The head of intelligence
for the Imperial Army.

202
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,714
It's a pleasure to meet you.

203
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,275
A consummate professional indeed.

204
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,914
Here's the codebook.

205
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,158
Shall we begin?

206
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,271
7-8-7-1

207
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,119
Got them.

208
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,476
Jin?

209
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,192
Eh--

210
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,470
What are they doing there?

211
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,597
They're, um...uh...

212
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,994
Enough with the um-ing.
What is it?

213
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,198
You've heard of Morse Code?

214
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:45,952
Get on with it.

215
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,988
Now...Morse code is use for

216
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,832
telegrams all over the world.

217
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,271
With Chinese, it works
a bit differently.

218
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,630
Each Chinese character is
represented by 4 digits.

219
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,758
There're 72 digits in
these telegram.

220
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,677
Total of 18 characters.

221
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,632
But the sender deliberately scrambled
the digits before they sent it out.

222
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,719
Now Li over there is
trying to figure out...

223
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,435
the algorithm they used.
Once she's got that,

224
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,831
she can decode the message.

225
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,591
One-Zero

226
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,115
And?

227
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,356
This can't be...

228
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,950
What's wrong?

229
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,119
Takeda et al to gather

230
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,277
at Bai Cao Hall on October 31.

231
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,360
What does it say?

232
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,232
They're planning to
assassinate Gen. Tsukeda.

233
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,239
We set a trap--a telegram with false
summons to a meeting with Tsukeda.

234
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,277
The mole in our office
took the bait.

235
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,437
And sent this to
their co-conspirators.

236
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,276
You five are the only ones

237
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,794
who had any contact
with the original message.

238
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,871
Which is to say--

239
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,833
One of you is the mole.

240
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,037
Who's been leaking intelligence

241
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,757
under the name Phantom.

242
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,669
Whichever one of you it is

243
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,952
just confess.

244
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,669
I promise you'll be
treated humanely.

245
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,835
Please forgive me,

246
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,468
but I have my orders.

247
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,955
Nobody leaves the building

248
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,631
until the Phantom is found.

249
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,718
Who are you writing to?

250
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,069
You scared me.

251
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,356
Dear sister...what're you
writing a letter for?

252
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,829
We'll be out here in 2 days.

253
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,872
I'll go find Liu myself.

254
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,356
And give him a piece of my mind.

255
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,036
You really think we'll be
out of here in 2 days?

256
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,709
Sure, it's not hard to
guess who this Phantom is.

257
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,395
Tea?

258
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,832
You've got a split seam!

259
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,828
On the left.

260
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,156
I'll stitch it up for you.

261
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,998
Take it off for me.

262
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,950
Wow, that's a big hole.

263
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,476
Is there a sewing kit here?

264
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,154
I think so...

265
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:38,951
Bingo!

266
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,870
Found it!

267
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,955
Here, let me help.

268
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,151
There you go.

269
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,796
You once told me,

270
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,110
that your mother wanted
you to be a proper lady, right?

271
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:00,872
Yeah.

272
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,191
This's the first time I've ever
seen you doing anything ladylike.

273
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,396
Sis...

274
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,312
I don't know why,

275
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,119
but I've always felt
close to you.

276
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,431
Especially today...

277
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,512
What's wrong?

278
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,957
Liu hasn't been by in days.

279
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:55,320
<i>Unfettered in the wild wastes</i>

280
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:22,957
<i>I mastered yin and yang,
and knew the heavens...</i>

281
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,468
What are you singing?

282
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,798
The Empty City.

283
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,470
It's an old Tangshan ballad,
from Leting.

284
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,437
Sing some more.

285
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,916
Well--

286
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,232
Would I be rewarded
with a smoke?

287
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,876
Here.

288
00:28:51,480 --> 00:29:02,072
<i>But when the country
needed me, I fought...</i>

289
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:09,073
<i>To cast out the
pretender to the throne...</i>

290
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,352
Why Captain Wu, I never knew
you were from Leting.

291
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,190
What--

292
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,630
You too?

293
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,192
My grandfather always used
to sing that when I was little.

294
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,829
No kidding?
What a coincidence.

295
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,989
<i>With all the people
in the headquarters,</i>

296
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:27,917
<i>we ever hardly get
the chance to talk.</i>

297
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,593
<i>I never thought
I had meet someone</i>

298
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,037
from my old hometown here.

299
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,152
It must be fate.

300
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,233
<i>There're plenty of people from
around there in the headquarters.</i>

301
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,237
<i>But not necessarily from
Leting village.</i>

302
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,035
It might just be us.

303
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,317
Yeah.

304
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,114
Say, after we get out of
here in a couple of days,

305
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,278
I'll take everyone out
to celebrate, my treat.

306
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,036
Has Li made a move yet?

307
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,190
Still mooning over

308
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,195
her actor boyfriend, Liu.

309
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,116
Gu just said

310
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,710
she knows who the Phantom is.

311
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,991
She seems a bit off.

312
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,037
A bit spoiled, you mean.

313
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,475
She comes from money.

314
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,079
As for Officer Bai...

315
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,711
he's got friends in
high places too.

316
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,873
So I've heard his relationship
with Commander Zhang...

317
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,351
is indeed very unique.

318
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,592
Come, Bai.

319
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,717
We're all waiting for you.

320
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,479
Here, have something to eat.

321
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,758
Quite a spread.

322
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,593
Is this suppose to be
our last supper?

323
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,557
My old friend Bai,
always the joker...

324
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,837
That little pretty head of yours

325
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,513
is just full of jokes.

326
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,318
You can count me out.

327
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,913
I'm no spy--

328
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,553
I faint at the sight
of chicken blood.

329
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,399
You think I'd join
the Resistance?

330
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,556
Wang--

331
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,155
You know me.

332
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,908
This section chief
position of mine...

333
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,516
It's bullshit, I got it
through connections.

334
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,513
You'd know better.

335
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,359
My wife's related to Commander
Zhang's wife on her father's side.

336
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,749
See?

337
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,555
This all has to be a mistake.

338
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,592
I've never heard
anything about the Phantom.

339
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,750
I mean

340
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,870
maybe it's the Japanese
that've the mole, right?

341
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,474
It couldn't be anymore obvious,

342
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,631
Section Chief Jin is
the one you want.

343
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,439
He's the most
suspicious of any of us.

344
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,350
Why?

345
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,039
He has a nephew,

346
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,912
who joined the Red Army
when he was only 15.

347
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,276
He's become chief of staff
at their headquarters in Yenan.

348
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,637
Fence-sitter that he is, Jin
must still be in contact with him.

349
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,277
He's been keeping a
mistress for years.

350
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,068
With money from
weapons smuggling.

351
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,349
Do I look like I'm
joking now?

352
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,073
I've got dirt on everybody
here, including yours.

353
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,555
What a rough job
you have--

354
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,670
Here all on your own.

355
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,031
The others are
downstairs for backup.

356
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,150
Backup?

357
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,154
As if we were dangerous.

358
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,116
I need to make a phone
call--just a short one.

359
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,196
No can do.

360
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,352
It's just to call home.

361
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,830
It won't be long, I promise.

362
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,912
You can even listen
if you want.

363
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,916
I told you,

364
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,871
it's not an option.

365
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,951
Fine, then I won't trouble you.

366
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,838
Here's the number to my house.

367
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,957
And a list of things I need.

368
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,599
Can you call them
for me and

369
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,630
have them bring
my things here.

370
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,509
Pretty please?

371
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,992
Ms Gu...

372
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,151
We need you to come with us.

373
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,790
I don't know--I mean,

374
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,552
I'm not sure--

375
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,075
Can't be certain...

376
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,793
What do you want me to do?

377
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,438
Make something up?

378
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,357
No, no!

379
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,949
Certainly not--

380
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,396
You were the one who
delivered the telegraph.

381
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,153
Just try and think back.

382
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,631
Did you notice anything
suspicious?

383
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,317
It all went according
to protocol.

384
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,510
Nothing to be suspicious of...

385
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,394
What were you going to say?

386
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,149
Nothing!

387
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,959
You paused.
Something came to mind.

388
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,911
Captain Wu saw the telegram.

389
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,795
Go on...

390
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,838
When I handed the
telegraph to Chief Jin,

391
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,149
Captain Wu was with him.

392
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,596
Normally...

393
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,756
A classified telegram
would be eyes-only...

394
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,874
for the officer in charge.

395
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,235
But that day...

396
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,591
When I delivered it
to Chief Jin,

397
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,313
Captain Wu didn't
look away,

398
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,754
he actually glanced
at it briefly.

399
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,714
He shouldn't have done that.

400
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,269
But then again...

401
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,111
it's probably nothing.

402
00:35:25,956 --> 00:35:27,311
Do you know how much blood
I've shed all the years

403
00:35:27,321 --> 00:35:29,527
I've served President Wang?

404
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,950
I was shot 3 times.

405
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,071
It's little weasels like you,

406
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,039
we should be watching out for.

407
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,833
Who knows which side you'll
end up on if the tables turn?

408
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,674
I see...

409
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,475
Until we catch the Phantom,

410
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,199
we're all still colleagues here.

411
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,754
You rank above me--
just above me--

412
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,195
And so I'm showing you...

413
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,795
the respect you deserve.

414
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,916
Let's hope you leave
here safely.

415
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,192
Ask whatever you want,

416
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,230
but the answer will
be the same...

417
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,749
I don't know anything.

418
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,436
I've checked.

419
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,955
It's the number to
the Gus' house.

420
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,593
What about the list?

421
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,435
Anything suspicious?

422
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:44,837
Looks normal to me.

423
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,949
Don't call her family.

424
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,668
Send someone to buy the
things she's asking for.

425
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,353
What if the others start
making similar requests?

426
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,510
None of them would
have the nerve.

427
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,398
What does her
family do again?

428
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,876
Her grandfather was
with General Xu.

429
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,550
Her father went
into business--

430
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,312
Textiles...

431
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,754
Cement, Shipping--

432
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,631
You named it.

433
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,430
They say he's close
to President Wang.

434
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,633
Just last year, he donated
a JU-52 to the Air Force.

435
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,428
He donated a plane?

436
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,755
That's what I call rich.

437
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,314
Let's make dinner
more interesting.

438
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,830
Before they go down, tell
everyone what the others've said,

439
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,995
including Gu saying she
knows who the Phantom is.

440
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,600
Why aren't you eating?
What's the matter?

441
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,272
Once a bitch...

442
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,435
always a bitch.

443
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,998
A mincing,
conniving little bitch.

444
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,715
Councillor Jin,

445
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,637
who're you talking about?

446
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,753
The faggot knows perfectly well.

447
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,075
Just exactly what I'm
talking about.

448
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,434
You're spoiling...my appetite.

449
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,154
I'll rip your fucking head off.

450
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,668
Calm down, chief.

451
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,677
Let him come!
The coward.

452
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,150
We'll see how hard
you can get.

453
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:17,958
Stop it!

454
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,599
- You want some whipping?
- We're all colleagues here.

455
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,518
Stop!

456
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,235
Stop it!
Calm down!

457
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,353
Colleagues my ass!

458
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,950
I'm no colleague of a
slanderous...rumor spreading bitch!

459
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,548
I was merely...

460
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,829
stating the facts.

461
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,910
Facts?

462
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,998
I'll give you facts.

463
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,075
I was shot twice last year
at the battle in Yueyang.

464
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,030
But I still keep going.

465
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,395
Didn't back down 'til I took
out the enemy pillbox.

466
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,792
Where were you then?

467
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,879
Sipping tea and reading the
newspaper in your fucking office.

468
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,070
Then whoring around
after work, I bet!

469
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,038
Captain Wu!

470
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,311
Being a brave soldier doesn't
mean you're always right.

471
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,354
Remember Deputy General Gao ?

472
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,155
A hero in every battle he
fought, even lost an arm for us.

473
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,750
But he still went to the
other side in the end.

474
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,190
Say that again.

475
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,117
Say it again!

476
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,791
You're calling me a traitor?

477
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,470
Just giving an example.

478
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,829
You don't need to volunteer
yourself so quickly.

479
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,069
Take it easy, Captain.

480
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,719
Stop it.

481
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,670
Get out of my way.

482
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,073
Out of my way. This is
no business of yours.

483
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,475
Go ahead.

484
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,391
Let's see what kind
of hero you are.

485
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,237
If you're so strong,
why don't you go...

486
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,316
pick fights with the
Japanese instead of women?

487
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,396
Captain Wu!

488
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,350
May I suggest you
finish your dinner first?

489
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,879
A man raises his
hand against a woman,

490
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,992
and nobody does anything?

491
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,388
There's no need for this.

492
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,439
We're all amongst ourselves.

493
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:32,463
NOBODY WILL MAKE IT
OUT OF HERE ALIVE

494
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:34,956
NEED TO TAKE
EXTREME MEASURES

495
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,788
TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF
GETTING MESSAGE OUT...

496
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,156
We truly apologize
for the...

497
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,919
inconvenience to you all.

498
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,958
Col. Takeda has specifically
directed...

499
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,838
After the Phantom
is found...

500
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,752
Each of you'll be rewarded
for your assistance.

501
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,830
If you'd all be
kind enough,

502
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,230
to write down your
ranks, pay grade...

503
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,113
and evaluation scores...

504
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,469
During the years of
your services--

505
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,273
You'll all be rewarded
accordingly once this is over.

506
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,956
What do you want?

507
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,472
What's going on?

508
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,119
Released me!

509
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,155
Who'd they get?

510
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:33,950
It's not me.

511
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,833
It's really not me!

512
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:36,996
Well, then can you
explain to me...

513
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:43,112
Just why your handwriting is
identical to the Phantom's?

514
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,553
Well?!

515
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,799
Someone's framing me!

516
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,878
It must be.
It must be!

517
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,675
Pull his pants down.

518
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,150
Hold your step.

519
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,399
Commander.

520
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,438
I'm disciplining my dog.

521
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,789
What's so funny about that?

522
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,433
There's a rat in your unit.

523
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,634
What rat?

524
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,956
General Tsukeda has asked me

525
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,669
to take full charge of this.

526
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,828
Commander Zhang...I'm afraid
the General faith in you

527
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:32,828
has been greatly shaken.

528
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,393
Do you evidence?

529
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,191
Bring over the handwriting file.

530
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,279
Now!

531
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,790
If it were anyone else, this
would already be over.

532
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,395
But since it's Lieutenant Bai,
your confidant...

533
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,389
I think it's best if you
prove your innocence first.

534
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,112
Commander...

535
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:23,951
Comamnder.

536
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,072
Help me!

537
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,556
I'm not the Phantom!

538
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,634
Officer Li, please get dressed
immediately and come with me.

539
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,230
Where to?

540
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,555
One minute. You've one
minute to get ready.

541
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,953
Please wait here.

542
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,434
Please enter...

543
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,236
Sir...

544
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,032
We have a situation.
One of our men,

545
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,451
just saw Captain Wu
barge into Gu's bedroom.

546
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,031
See anything?

547
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,151
It's too dark.

548
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,955
Turn it up.

549
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:33,598
I'm apologizing to you,

550
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,477
Please just leave.

551
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:35,996
I don't want your apology.

552
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,714
Why? Why can't we
just talk it out?

553
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,392
What are you doing?

554
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:42,837
I'll call the guards!

555
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,913
I'm their commanding officer.

556
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,878
What are they going
to do to me?

557
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,272
Let go of me!
Let go!

558
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:52,752
What's going on?

559
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,235
We're losing the signal...

560
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,279
Your boyfriend,
Liu--the actor?

561
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:08,236
You haven't seen each
other for about a week, no?

562
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,119
Yes!

563
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,993
He's with the
military police now.

564
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,280
What's he doing there?

565
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,879
What do you think
he's doing there?

566
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,230
Commissioner!

567
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,075
Why didn't you stop him?

568
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,674
I didn't dare, sir.

569
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,036
Knock on the door.

570
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,950
And ask Captain Wu
down to the living room.

571
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:48,797
Tell him I would like
to speak to him.

572
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:49,956
- Go!
- Yes, sir!

573
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,596
What is it?

574
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,359
Commissioner, sir! No, sorry,
I mean, Chief Captain, sir!

575
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,039
Commissioner Wang
would like to...

576
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,549
Talk to you in the
living room.

577
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,596
Tell him I'm sleeping.

578
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,152
HUMAN ANATOMY

579
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,958
The first time I saw you,

580
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,309
I noticed your features.

581
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,872
A narrow forehead...

582
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,508
high cheekbones...

583
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,436
and a thin nose.

584
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,308
Your eyes are deep-set.

585
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,195
Women with that kind
of facial structure...

586
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:50,950
are not to be trusted.

587
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,270
Even if on the surface,

588
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,788
they may seem to
be above reproach.

589
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,391
You've been acting,
all along...

590
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,395
What do you take
Liu in for?

591
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,195
A unit like counter-insurgency
can't allow for any uncertainty.

592
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,078
If you share your
bed with a rebel,

593
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,072
what else might you
be sharing with him?

594
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,872
Ms Gu?

595
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,072
Ms Gu...are you asleep?

596
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,549
What do you want?

597
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,750
Just passing by.

598
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,395
Are you ok?

599
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,076
I'm fine.

600
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,873
I brought you a snack.

601
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,348
If you need anything...

602
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:01,797
I'll be around.

603
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,431
To hell with him!

604
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,198
If you can prove that
you're not the Phantom,

605
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,110
it would also clear up
our suspicions about Liu.

606
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,318
I suspect the resume
you submitted to us...

607
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,075
was mostly made up.

608
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,718
During the interrogation
today,

609
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,679
your hostility--

610
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,154
only shows that you're
hiding something.

611
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,434
You're one of our best
code-breakers, I'm told.

612
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,319
But did you know that...

613
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,629
every inch of the body
carries a code?

614
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,792
If you can pass
this examination,

615
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,079
you and Liu'll have
nothing to worry about.

616
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,074
Your physical features...

617
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,749
from every orifice
to every limb,

618
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,037
all carry the genetic
code of who we are...

619
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,032
Showing our true identities.

620
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,828
In order to get to that,

621
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,830
I'll need to break
your will first.

622
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,910
And the way to
break your will,

623
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,679
is to help you realize,

624
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,394
that your body does
not belong to you.

625
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,637
It belongs to your enemy.

626
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,159
Now let go.

627
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,478
Give yourself over completely.

628
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,475
"Wherefore, there in her
shimmering eyes of jade...

629
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,315
shine golden pupils
peering at my own?"

630
00:55:47,241 --> 00:55:49,269
HAVE COME UP WITH A PLAN

631
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:51,308
HEAVEN HELP ME NOW

632
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,155
So Lieutenant Bai died
during the interrogation--

632
00:55:57,305 --> 00:56:57,328
