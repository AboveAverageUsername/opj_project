1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,815
Is that correct?

2
00:00:01,299 --> 00:00:04,336
Commander Zhang?

3
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:07,370
Right up until he died...

4
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:09,007
Bai insisted he was
being framed.

5
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:11,893
I've wrong him!

6
00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:15,337
Everything we did for
the Imperial Army,

7
00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:20,494
and this is how
you repay us?

8
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:24,012
What else did
Lieutenant Bai say?

9
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:28,052
He say to hell
with handwriting.

10
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:30,375
Chief Jin is a master
calligrapher--

11
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:32,817
He could imitate anyone's
handwriting he wanted to.

12
00:00:33,339 --> 00:00:36,729
My condolences.

13
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:40,851
Please take the Commander home.

14
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:45,098
Rest well, Commander Zhang.

15
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:52,418
We've been had.

16
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:57,730
The Phantom is still amongst us.

17
00:00:57,779 --> 00:00:59,610
We have 2 days left.

18
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:03,177
No more mistakes.

19
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:10,769
Colonel Takeda.

20
00:01:11,498 --> 00:01:12,917
ONE MONTH AGO

21
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:15,169
Colonel Takeda.

22
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,138
Colonel Takeda!

23
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:20,929
Any thoughts you'd like
to share with us?

24
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:26,337
Forgive me for being so direct.

25
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:28,537
But I don't believe
your plan is feasible.

26
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,574
Nothing comes quickly
or easily in battle.

27
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,135
The cost of a rushed attack
would be staggering.

28
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:45,774
Your opinion comes...

29
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:49,537
as no surprise to me.

30
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:53,615
Your grandfather killed himself

31
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:57,334
on the Northern front-lines.

32
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:03,214
Cowardice seems to be
a Takeda family tradition.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,074
Подржите нас и постаните VIP члан да бисте уклонили све огласе са www.OpenSubtitles.org

34
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:38,047
We have a situation.

35
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,258
The cripple is here!

36
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:44,609
The janitor who posts the
messages at the temple?

37
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:46,252
I checked with the
administration--

38
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:49,094
He handles the slop-water here.

39
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:50,614
However, he's not
supposed to be here...

40
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:53,329
until the day after tomorrow.

41
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:55,092
He's swapped his
shift with someone else.

42
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:57,289
The Phantom's gone quiet--

43
00:02:57,859 --> 00:02:58,655
They're getting worried.

44
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:00,731
The Phantom must be anxious
to notify the rebels,

45
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:03,369
not to carrry through
the assassination.

46
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:05,530
Here is our chance
to set a trap.

47
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:12,615
And force the Phantom forward.

48
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:27,008
Attention everyone!

49
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:28,890
After 3 days of investigation,

50
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:31,011
we have made great progress.

51
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:32,727
We are now almost
certain that

52
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:36,455
Lieutenant Bai is the Phantom.

53
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:40,698
As a gesture of our
appreciation for your cooperation,

54
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:42,258
Col. Takeda has arranged
a special lunch for today.

55
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:45,452
Please be punctual.

56
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:00,419
Thank you!

57
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:10,457
Hey you!

58
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:13,448
Go tidy up the dishes
and bring back the plates.

59
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:04,970
I, Li Ningyu...

60
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:11,857
Graduated with honors
from Wharton,

61
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:14,850
I am not a whore.

62
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,571
I am not!

63
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,608
I may not share
your rank...

64
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:29,368
But that doesn't
mean I'm afraid of you.

65
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:37,531
Sis...

66
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:39,209
You bastard!

67
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:40,056
It's all right now.

68
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:40,811
Bastard!

69
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:42,409
Let go of me!

70
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:44,769
Come now.

71
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:45,930
It's ok.

72
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:46,537
Let go of me!

73
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:47,656
It's ok!

74
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:50,969
No way I'll surrender myself.

75
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:00,691
These goddamned people.

76
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:03,448
We should

77
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:05,777
just killed them all
and have done with it.

78
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,530
It would make no
difference to me.

79
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:13,254
But I would worried for
you, Commissioner Wang.

80
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:17,050
One innocent officer
has died already.

81
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:19,374
If we should take
another life...

82
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,377
and still find no sign
of the Phantom...

83
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:23,457
What would you tell
Commander Zhang?

84
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:28,451
Let's go over the facts again.

85
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,971
I believe we can
rule out Officer Li.

86
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:35,617
I've looked her over carefully.

87
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:38,215
The only thing on her
mind is her boyfriend.

88
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:41,168
Someone so weak-minded,

89
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:42,808
couldn't possibly be
the Phantom.

90
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:43,770
What about Jin?

91
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,090
He looked at the
old crippple...

92
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:49,252
when he was handing
him his dirty plate.

93
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,168
Look at it the other way.

94
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:54,132
Jin has nothing to hide.

95
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:55,454
If he looked at the cripple,

96
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:57,577
that only shows one thing,

97
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,930
he's unguarded.

98
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,575
When a stranger comes close,
it's only natural to react.

99
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:04,410
If someone doesn't react...

100
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:07,970
they're deliberately
avoiding it.

101
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:09,738
Trying to control their focus.

102
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,174
Neither Captain Wu
nor Officer Gu...

103
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,250
looked at the cripple once
throughout the whole meal.

104
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:35,251
One of them is our Phantom.

105
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:42,694
Everyone come outside.

106
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,613
Gather at the West
wing immediately.

107
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,011
To prove his innocence,

108
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:03,251
Lieutenant Bai gave his life.

109
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:05,012
Right up until his death...

110
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:06,772
He insisted he was being framed.

111
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:13,608
Lieutenant Bai was very
close to the Commander.

112
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:16,499
But even that
couldn't save him.

113
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:19,934
I suggest you all
ask yourselves,

114
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:22,377
with nothing to lean on...

115
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:24,896
How will you escape his fate?

116
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,891
Merciful Buddha!
Whoever it is, please...

117
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:32,097
I beg you--step up!

118
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,455
Spare the innocence.

119
00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:35,888
We would rather be
wrongly harsh,

120
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:37,891
than wrongly lenient.

121
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,336
If the Phantom wants to
leave, there are 2 ways.

122
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:42,776
In a box, or in--

123
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:47,895
What the--?

124
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:49,688
Motherfucker! Is there
anything you won't do?

125
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:51,214
Calm down, Captain Wu!

126
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:52,528
Everyone will take their turn.

127
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:54,130
My friend...

128
00:08:54,979 --> 00:08:57,209
Stay away!

129
00:08:57,699 --> 00:08:58,575
Stay away!
Don't come close!

130
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:00,178
Stay away!
Stay away!

131
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:06,731
You don't want to
do this, Jin.

132
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:12,893
I know what you do to people.

133
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:15,098
It'd be worse than death.

134
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:18,768
I'd rather end this here.

135
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,293
Another one down.

136
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:04,727
What do you want?
What're you doing to me?

137
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:06,890
Let go of me!
Let go of me!

138
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:08,335
Let go of me!

139
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:09,449
Sis!

140
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,776
- Let go of me.
- Sis!

141
00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:15,734
Let go of me!

142
00:10:16,939 --> 00:10:18,850
Let go of me!

143
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,418
Go back to your room.

144
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,168
Don't say a word.

145
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,494
Go!

146
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:14,695
Why aren't they
making a sound?

147
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:22,733
<i>You dropped a cigarette at lunch.</i>

148
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,294
<i>What're you talking about?</i>

149
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,375
<i>There was a message
on the cigarette.</i>

150
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:29,216
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

151
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:30,215
<i>Now many more innocent
people'll you let die?</i>

152
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:31,496
<i>Officer Gu!</i>

153
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:33,657
<i>What did I ever do to you?</i>

154
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:35,248
<i>Why're always against me?</i>

155
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:36,614
<i>It's not about you--</i>

156
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:37,809
<i>I'm just saying what
I witnessesd.</i>

157
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:38,691
<i>What the FUCK did
you witness?</i>

158
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:40,174
<i>The cigarette is coded.</i>

159
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:44,210
<i>I'm going to give it to them.</i>

160
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:46,609
<i>Officer Gu!</i>

161
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:48,451
<i>No one else should have to
die so that you can live!</i>

162
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:51,929
<i>You bitch, I'll kill you!</i>

163
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:52,736
Go!

164
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:53,456
Yes, sir.

165
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:54,177
You too!

166
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:55,653
Yes, sir!

167
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:02,251
The door is jammed.

168
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:07,450
Out of the way!

169
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:14,209
Let go of her!

170
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:14,731
Let go.

171
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:17,456
You fucking whore!

172
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:19,734
Fuck you!

173
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:32,778
If only you'd spoken
out earlier.

174
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,532
There'd been no need
for any of this.

175
00:12:39,979 --> 00:12:41,014
Give it here.

176
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,088
During lunch yesterday...

177
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:59,337
The chief captain took
out a cigarette...

178
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:01,213
and dropped it on the ground.

179
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:05,573
I could sense that
something was going on.

180
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:06,894
So I covered it with my foot.

181
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:28,609
Morse code?

182
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:31,368
Yes.

183
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:32,574
In Morse code

184
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:34,174
this represents
a single word...

185
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:35,928
"Abort"

186
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:42,213
There're plenty of
smokers in this building.

187
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:46,569
But you're the only one
who smokes "Three Cannons"

188
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:48,654
Come on...

189
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:54,371
I'll give you one more chance.

190
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:57,297
For ths sake of
all our time together.

191
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:05,011
That bitch stole my
cigarettes to frame me.

192
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,413
I don't know shit about codes.

193
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:11,252
You're all fucking blind!

194
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:12,729
She's playing you!

195
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:54,888
Just confess.

196
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:57,137
Takeda has assured me
that if you'll only confess,

197
00:14:57,339 --> 00:14:58,294
you can be pardoned.

198
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:00,371
Maybe even rewarded.

199
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:09,054
Our formidable Captain Wu--

200
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,048
Too hard for electricity.

201
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:16,894
Come-- Let the Chief
Captain down.

202
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,250
THIS IS MY LAST CHANCE
TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT

203
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,320
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO TODAY

204
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:47,814
Gu...

205
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:01,810
It was a close call last night.

206
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:03,888
I've sewn up the rip for you.

207
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:06,290
But I'm not very good at it.

208
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:07,569
The stitching's a bit...

209
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:08,849
uneven...

210
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:10,858
You've been targeted...

211
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:12,938
Both you and the Chief Captain.

212
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:14,049
Captain Wu hates my gut.

213
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:15,938
He's always antagonizing me.

214
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:24,849
I know it isn't Captain Wu.

215
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:26,414
Don't worry...

216
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:29,413
I'll never turn on you.

217
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:45,174
Here, try it in.

218
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,251
When did you know?

219
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:10,211
Just now.

220
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:19,776
It was a blind guess.

221
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:31,374
Mr Six.

222
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:44,448
Ah, Chief Captain--

223
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:47,893
Long time no see.

224
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:08,336
You're aware of Mr Six's,
pride in his work.

225
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:11,817
It's not too late
for you to confess.

226
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,651
Fuck you and fuck your ancestors!

227
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:16,050
I'll come back

228
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:20,050
and fucking kill you
in my next life!

229
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:25,857
We're not strangers, Captain Wu.

230
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:29,376
You were always generous to me.

231
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:31,291
So I'll be...restrained.

232
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:39,014
Now relax...

233
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:41,449
Breathe deeply.

234
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:45,332
Relax, Chief Captain...

235
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,334
Tell me.

236
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:04,769
Where is Magnum?

237
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:12,251
This one's good for the kidneys.

238
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:34,209
So my boyfriend's
one of you too?

239
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:41,695
You sent Liu to me?

240
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:45,175
You've been using
me all this time--

241
00:20:58,459 --> 00:20:59,892
Why me?

242
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:04,817
I rank too low.
Can't get enough access.

243
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:07,051
We hope you'd become one of us.

244
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:13,895
This is beyond me.

245
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:18,455
Was anything real?

246
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:20,972
I've always thought
of you as a sister.

247
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:30,449
As a sister?

248
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:36,539
If they knew about
this conversation,

249
00:21:36,739 --> 00:21:38,650
you think I'd make it out alive?

250
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:42,334
They already got Liu.

251
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:43,654
Had you heard? Huh!

252
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:56,607
Where are you going?

253
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:57,615
To turn you in.

254
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:00,295
I'm going to turn you in.

255
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,015
Fantastic.

256
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:03,214
To die by your hand...

257
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:06,651
is probably the best
I can hope for.

258
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:46,975
You're a monster!

259
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:48,812
I was only doing my job.

260
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:53,814
I didn't want it to
go this far either.

261
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:27,015
Magnum...where's Magnum?

262
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:31,968
Right...here.

263
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:48,978
You've already made it--

264
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:52,093
They think Captain Wu's
the Phantom.

265
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:59,378
I was the one who sent
out the bad information.

266
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:02,652
Now I need to get the
word out to my comrades.

267
00:24:04,979 --> 00:24:08,767
There's only one way,
turn me in.

268
00:24:10,459 --> 00:24:12,848
I would never do that!

269
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:14,811
What're you thinking?

270
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:17,895
How could a message be worth
more than your own life, huh?

271
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:23,967
Your life,huh?

272
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:30,931
I don't care...

273
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:37,609
what other people
do with their lifes--

274
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:42,096
I want you to live.

275
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:51,973
For the first time I can
finally open up to you...

276
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:55,489
If only for a few more
days and nights--

277
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:56,928
to talk with you,
heart to heart.

278
00:24:57,699 --> 00:24:59,496
But there's no time left.

279
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:00,694
Do you understand?
No time.

280
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:06,652
I'm begging you.

281
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:08,811
Turn me in.

282
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:23,688
Usually, 3 needles's
all it takes...

283
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:26,215
for an ordinary man to confess
and fingerprint their testimony.

284
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:28,293
The Chief Captain...

285
00:25:29,219 --> 00:25:31,255
is indeed a remarkable man.

286
00:25:31,939 --> 00:25:33,452
Is there any other way...

287
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:36,050
to make him talk?

288
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:12,297
Open the gate!
Let me in!

289
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:33,088
I found this under
Officer Gu's pillow.

290
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:42,807
The Chief Captain's innocent!

291
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:46,852
Hurry up.

292
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:18,734
Flip him over.

293
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:35,818
<i>Unfettered in the wild wastes</i>

294
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:41,132
<i>I mastered</i>

295
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:51,976
<i>Yin and Yang</i>

296
00:27:54,979 --> 00:28:01,612
<i>And knews the heavens...</i>

297
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:15,012
<i>But when the country
needed me, I fought</i>

298
00:28:39,339 --> 00:28:41,330
You smoke Camels.

299
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,977
And yet Officer Li found a pack
of 3 Cannons under your pillow.

300
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:47,490
That's awfully damning.

301
00:28:57,859 --> 00:28:59,929
I.m trying, really trying
to help you here.

302
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:01,215
But

303
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:02,893
we're running out of time.

304
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:06,975
Those aren't my cigarettes.

305
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:11,771
Get her up there!

306
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:29,770
Stop.

307
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:47,057
She won't talk.

308
00:30:02,939 --> 00:30:04,372
How do you do,
Phantom-sensei.

309
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:07,170
We meet at last.

310
00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:19,216
How long've you been spying at
the Counter-Insurgency Center?

311
00:30:19,699 --> 00:30:20,927
Do you take orders
directly from Magnum?

312
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:28,687
I can guarantee you...

313
00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:31,937
full protection if you cooperate.

314
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:33,578
Not only for you,

315
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:37,575
but also your family.

316
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:41,891
I can guarantee that.

317
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:51,412
Let's not get carried
away now, Takeda.

318
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:55,574
During a strategy meeting, you
assaulted a superior officer.

319
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:56,894
You're about to be
deported back to Japan.

320
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:00,211
Where you'll probably face court
martial. You're in no position--

321
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:03,653
To guarantee me anything.

322
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:17,414
Let me put it this way,

323
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:20,609
when I say I can guarantee
you and your family safety,

324
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:24,533
I'm also saying that

325
00:31:25,379 --> 00:31:26,334
I'm in a position

326
00:31:26,979 --> 00:31:27,889
to hurt you...

327
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,250
and your loved ones.

328
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:43,968
Hello?

329
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:51,373
There must've been a
delay on the road.

330
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:54,812
20 minutes later than planned.

331
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:56,492
Number 6, South Bank--

332
00:31:56,939 --> 00:31:58,531
That's your parents'
address, no?

333
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:00,337
Leave my parents out of this.
This has nothing to do with them.

334
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:09,896
A call for you.

335
00:32:15,219 --> 00:32:17,130
Mother...

336
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:21,134
Right now.

337
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,695
Another gun just like this one,

338
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:26,897
is pointed at your
mother's head.

339
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:33,494
Your decision.

340
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:36,577
Save her life and you
can save your own.

341
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:51,096
Enough.

342
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:54,136
Tell Madame Gu

343
00:32:54,459 --> 00:32:56,097
her daughter'll be home soon.

344
00:32:59,219 --> 00:33:00,937
You see,

345
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:03,248
that wasn't too hard was it?

346
00:33:14,979 --> 00:33:16,378
I am the Phantom.

347
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:21,171
I take my orders directly
from Magnum.

348
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:25,619
Captain Wu never laid
eyes on the telegram.

349
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:27,298
I nmde that up to frame him.

350
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:31,371
As for Lieutenat Bai, I was
the one who forged his--

351
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:33,535
Let's talk about Magnum.

352
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,897
Where is he now?

353
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:41,854
Ok!

354
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:46,529
But not in front of him.

355
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:03,498
I've no idea where he is,

356
00:34:03,699 --> 00:34:05,417
I've never seen him.

357
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:07,410
But you must be

358
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:09,578
in contact with him.

359
00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:12,137
The board in front of
the City Temple.

360
00:34:12,339 --> 00:34:13,408
Does he post the orders himself?

361
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:14,728
What do you think?

362
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:15,974
Would you do it yourself?

363
00:34:16,499 --> 00:34:18,854
You're wasting my time.

364
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:24,733
Sorry.

365
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,811
But the truth is I know
more about you...

366
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:30,097
than I do about Magnum.

367
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:38,217
Commander, sir!

368
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:45,455
Where is Takeda?

369
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:51,250
I need to see him now.

370
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:01,218
What else can you tell me?

371
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:03,052
Oh, lots...

372
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:05,333
About your family...Your
upbringing...

373
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:06,978
And about that awful
weak spot of yours...

374
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:13,288
Your grandfather became Lieutenant
General after Meiji Restoration.

375
00:35:13,899 --> 00:35:15,935
Your father also
distinguished himself.

376
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:19,377
As a Colonel in the Navy.

377
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:26,448
Indeed!

378
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:29,693
You're a most talented spy.

379
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:35,450
Halfway through the
Russo-Japanese war,

380
00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:38,609
your grandfather killed
himself in the front-line.

381
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:45,449
No military men have
ever respected you.

382
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:58,809
You bitch!

383
00:36:03,819 --> 00:36:06,652
Don't shoot!

384
00:36:22,979 --> 00:36:24,697
She was determined to die.

385
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:27,016
And we all played
right into it.

386
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:05,417
You never had any authority
to conduct this investigation.

387
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:10,015
Gen. Tsukeda turned
down your request--

388
00:37:11,179 --> 00:37:13,488
This operation--
Is entirely illegtimate!

389
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:18,930
At this point,
does it really matter...

390
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:21,456
wether I was authorized or not?

391
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:24,288
My goal--

392
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:26,617
is to catch Magnum.

393
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:29,739
And wipe out his
terrorist organization.

394
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:32,850
I cannot return to
Japan in shame.

395
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:38,497
You conducted interrogations
under false military orders.

396
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:40,658
Two ranking officers died here.

397
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:42,498
Along with a Chief Captain
who's half dead.

398
00:37:42,979 --> 00:37:44,458
If word of this gets out,

399
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:45,888
they'll haul both of us
before a court-martial.

400
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:47,817
We need to find someone
to pin this on.

401
00:37:55,299 --> 00:37:56,254
Sirs...

402
00:37:57,299 --> 00:38:00,097
I have matters to discuss
with Col. Takeda.

403
00:38:00,299 --> 00:38:01,015
Leave us be.

404
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:02,649
Yes sir.

405
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:22,051
You double-crossing
son of a bitch!

406
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:24,889
You son of a bitch!

407
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:26,175
Takeda!

408
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:27,495
Colonel Takeda!

409
00:38:27,779 --> 00:38:28,655
You know I've...

410
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,088
I've always been loyal--

411
00:38:30,499 --> 00:38:31,090
Back-stabbing bastards!

412
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,015
At least the Phantom
wasn't able to escape.

413
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:00,418
Stick with the original
plan tonight.

414
00:39:00,979 --> 00:39:02,458
Set a trap at Bai Cao Hall.

415
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:06,178
If we can catch Magnum...

416
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:08,576
we might still have a chance.

417
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:17,929
THREE MONTHS LATER

418
00:41:31,419 --> 00:41:32,977
Where did you last make port?

419
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:34,775
Taiwan?

420
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:36,049
Saigon?

421
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:38,168
No, not Saigon--

422
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:43,054
This ship doesn't stop there.

423
00:41:53,939 --> 00:41:56,328
What's the point of
sending more troops in?

424
00:41:59,179 --> 00:42:01,215
This war might just end
earlier than we'd thought.

425
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:06,377
I'm going home a criminal.

426
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:08,732
But I've just got it
better than you--

427
00:42:09,379 --> 00:42:10,971
At least I'm going home.

428
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:26,379
I'm here to shorten the trip.

429
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:06,038
'Peace at Last"

430
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:31,092
Li Ningyu!

431
00:43:31,899 --> 00:43:32,490
Li Ningyu!

432
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:34,330
Li Ningyu!

433
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:35,495
There's someone here for you.

434
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:46,455
You know how it is--

435
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:49,294
After working for the
puppet regime during the war,

436
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:51,377
I'm really pretty lucky...

437
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:52,534
to have even this.

438
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:55,408
The report you wrote
helped a lot--

439
00:43:55,779 --> 00:43:57,974
I should thank you.

440
00:43:58,899 --> 00:44:04,053
Poor Liu, though--

441
00:44:04,379 --> 00:44:06,654
The Japanese were going to
put him in front of a firing squad.

442
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,408
But 3 days before the execution,

443
00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:10,774
the Japanese surrendered.

444
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:13,295
He kept his life alright.

445
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:16,287
But he's never been the same.

446
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:20,170
Anyway, you're not
here to hear me complain.

447
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:25,890
Actually...

448
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:28,534
I'm here about the dress.

449
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:32,053
The dress?

450
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:35,207
The one Gu mended for you.

451
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,331
Gu and I...

452
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:42,530
we were both in the Resistance.

453
00:44:42,699 --> 00:44:44,291
Although we were both undercover
in the Counter-Insurgency Center,

454
00:44:44,739 --> 00:44:46,013
she had no idea who I was.

455
00:44:46,379 --> 00:44:48,176
It wasn't until that night
on the balcony,

456
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:51,138
when I started singing
"The Empty City,"

457
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:53,927
that she learned I was
one of her comrades.

458
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:05,334
We use the song like
a secret password,

459
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,928
to reach out to our comrades...

460
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:09,049
whenever we're in trouble.

461
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:28,377
Relax, now.

462
00:45:28,979 --> 00:45:30,810
I lost my temper.

463
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:32,572
I'm here to apologize.

464
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:39,208
I don't want your apology.

465
00:45:40,299 --> 00:45:43,052
Please just leave!

466
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:46,497
- What are you doing?
- Just relax.

467
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:47,529
I'll call the guards!

468
00:45:48,419 --> 00:45:49,693
Stop!
What're you doing?

469
00:45:52,899 --> 00:45:53,649
Are you trying to threaten me?

470
00:45:53,979 --> 00:45:54,570
I'm their commanding officer.

471
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:56,258
What are they going
to do to me?

472
00:45:56,659 --> 00:45:58,172
Let go of me!

473
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:00,777
Relax now. Let's sit
down and talk it out.

474
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:01,451
- Let go of me!
- Relax!

475
00:46:01,819 --> 00:46:02,774
We're both from the
same village...

476
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:05,414
- I won't do anything to harm you.
- Let go of me!

477
00:46:05,739 --> 00:46:06,615
Let go.
Back off!

478
00:46:06,939 --> 00:46:07,610
Just calm down.

479
00:46:11,299 --> 00:46:12,527
I know you're the one.

480
00:46:13,219 --> 00:46:14,049
But I beg you,

481
00:46:14,379 --> 00:46:15,334
comrade to comrade,
hide yourself.

482
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,172
Let me take the heat.

483
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:19,211
Try to get the word out.

484
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:22,179
But it was me that sent
out the false intelligence.

485
00:46:22,539 --> 00:46:23,449
I should take the consequences.

486
00:46:23,979 --> 00:46:26,288
You couldn't stand the torture.

487
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:28,572
You're in no position to
tell me what to do--

488
00:46:28,979 --> 00:46:29,729
I only take orders
from Magnum.

489
00:46:52,379 --> 00:46:53,812
Then why was Gu...

490
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:55,938
always clashing with you?

491
00:46:56,699 --> 00:46:57,768
It's one of our tricks.

492
00:46:58,139 --> 00:46:59,777
If 2 comrades are taken
in at the same time,

493
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:01,936
we fight, accuse each other,
do whatever it takes...

494
00:47:02,179 --> 00:47:04,090
to keep them from
getting everyone.

495
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:06,974
That way, at least one of
us would get out alive.

496
00:47:07,339 --> 00:47:09,648
Let go of me!

497
00:47:25,908 --> 00:47:30,586
<i>If word doesn't get out tonight,
the Resistance will be crushed.</i>

498
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,219
<i>You must survive. Find a way
to get the message out.</i>

499
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:54,411
<i>I'm MAGNUM. I hereby
order you to turn me in.</i>

500
00:48:12,246 --> 00:48:15,410
<i>You stay alive.
I have a plan.</i>

501
00:48:20,019 --> 00:48:22,169
You dropped a
cigarette at lunch.

502
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:24,538
What're you talking about?

503
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:25,888
There was a message
on the cigarette.

504
00:48:26,419 --> 00:48:27,329
Are you out of your mind?

505
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:30,492
I didn't understand at the time
what she was trying to do.

506
00:48:30,979 --> 00:48:33,015
She'd decided from the start
that she'd sacrifice herself.

507
00:48:33,459 --> 00:48:37,418
To make sure I got the
message out.

508
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:43,448
That song,"The Empty City,"

509
00:48:43,899 --> 00:48:46,174
with a few changes in
the tune and lyrics,

510
00:48:46,419 --> 00:48:48,057
it becomes a tool for
transmitting urgent messages.

511
00:49:03,597 --> 00:49:04,850
FALSE INFORMATION

512
00:49:07,055 --> 00:49:09,075
ABORT MISSION  MAGNUM

513
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:16,772
When Gu made you
turn her in,

514
00:49:16,979 --> 00:49:18,492
it was to make sure
that I got out.

515
00:49:19,579 --> 00:49:23,254
What if you'd been unconscious
when you got to the hospital?

516
00:49:24,459 --> 00:49:27,371
Or nobody was there
to hear your message?

517
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:28,893
Then it would all have
been for nothing.

518
00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:43,214
In fact...

519
00:49:43,539 --> 00:49:45,769
Gu had also sewn a
mission abort message...

520
00:49:45,979 --> 00:49:48,573
onto her undergarments--

521
00:49:48,779 --> 00:49:50,531
As another way to
get words out.

522
00:50:05,898 --> 00:50:09,682
FALSE INFORMATION   ABORT MISSION
PHANTOM

523
00:50:11,739 --> 00:50:14,617
Nobody was going to get
out of that mansion alive.

524
00:50:14,859 --> 00:50:15,769
So Gu...

525
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:20,735
used her body to pass
on the message in death.

526
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:48,778
She also wanted
me to pass on

527
00:50:49,259 --> 00:50:51,329
the message she left for you.

528
00:50:51,739 --> 00:50:54,173
It's in the lining of your dress.

529
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:19,014
You'd know this
better than me--

530
00:51:20,019 --> 00:51:21,247
It's all Morse Code.

531
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,925
THIS IS MY LAST CHANCE
TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT

532
00:51:29,945 --> 00:51:34,373
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO TODAY

533
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:38,952
I'M NOT AFRAID OF
DYING--

534
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:45,964
BUT ONLY FEAR MY LOVED ONES
WON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE DIED FOR

535
00:51:47,135 --> 00:51:49,803
I AM LEAVING THESE WORDS
IN THE HOPE THAT

536
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:55,245
LI AND MY FAMILY WILL
FORGIVE MY DECISION

537
00:53:03,699 --> 00:53:06,691
<i>I'm leaving these words
in the hope that...</i>

538
00:53:07,419 --> 00:53:12,937
<i>Li and my family will
forgive my decision.</i>

539
00:53:13,459 --> 00:53:15,529
<i>But I have faith...</i>

540
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:19,129
<i>that you'll come to
understand my intentions.</i>

541
00:53:19,539 --> 00:53:21,769
<i>My dearest loved ones...</i>

542
00:53:22,179 --> 00:53:24,010
<i>Though my death
brings you great pain,</i>

543
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:27,492
<i>but our people face
mortal peril.</i>

544
00:53:27,859 --> 00:53:29,451
<i>I would do anything to stop it.</i>

545
00:53:29,779 --> 00:53:31,053
<i>Even if it's giving
up my little life.</i>

546
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:35,213
<i>Whatever they may
