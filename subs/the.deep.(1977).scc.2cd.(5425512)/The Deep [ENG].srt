3
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,840
What are you trying to do,
kill yourself?

4
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,120
There's something down there!

5
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,440
What was it?

6
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,480
I don't know!

7
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,880
Something grabbed my arm, twisted me
around! Almost pulled my arm off!

8
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,680
Come on, give me this.

9
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,680
Listen, I told you...

10
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,080
...you gotta stay with me.

11
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,080
David, I panicked.

12
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,320
David, I panicked.

13
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,080
Well, listen, you can't panic.

14
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,560
You just gotta learn to relax
and control yourself.

15
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,680
- You all right?
- Yeah.

16
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,880
Actually, David, it's my foot!

17
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,280
The damn thing bit off my entire foot.

18
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,520
Look, it's just a bloody stump.

19
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,880
I almost drowned.

20
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,280
I almost drowned.

21
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,840
We might as well be married
for all the concern I get.

22
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,480
You wanna go dive naked?

23
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,480
In the bathtub, in the hotel?

24
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,080
Gail, look!

25
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,880
Look at this.

26
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,000
What is it?

27
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,680
I don't know.

28
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,880
It looks like a coin.

29
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,280
I'm gonna take a shower.

30
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,680
Okay, baby.

31
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,080
Goliath? I thought you said
you were diving on the Brighton.

32
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,400
We did dive the Brighton.

33
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,640
Then we spotted that wreck,
so we decided we'd take a look.

34
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,080
It wasn't in the guidebook.

35
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,120
You're damn right it's not.
Goliath is full of munitions.

36
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,000
Tourists aren't allowed
to blow themselves up, you know.

37
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,280
Oh, yeah?

38
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,960
Yeah.

39
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,760
I can't believe the stuff Treece
has found off the coast around here.

40
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,080
I can believe it.

41
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,360
- What have we found out?
- I don't know.

42
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,080
O.P.N. means ora pro nobis,
"pray for us."

43
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,080
And "S.C." I can't find
in any of these.

44
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,880
If I'd wanted to spend
my holiday in the library...

45
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,520
...I could've walked 10 blocks
to 42nd Street.

46
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,480
Let's approach this methodically.

47
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,640
- I'd love to play tennis!
- Our coin is dated 1 71 4.

48
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,680
The treasure ships that went down then
were King Philip's fleet in 1715.

49
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,040
- Ping Pong!
- That's fantastic, 30 million in gold!

50
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,960
I'm gonna play tennis with a pro.

51
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
No.

52
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,720
All right.

53
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,920
Wine, madam?

54
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,480
No, thank you.

55
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,480
Would you care for some more, sir?

56
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,680
- Would you like some dessert?
- No, thank you.

57
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,480
It was here, outside the wreck,
where I almost had my arm torn off.

58
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,920
If you were there, I was across
the hull, in about 80 feet of water.

59
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
That's where I found that coin.

60
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,000
You must be the young couple
who found that bottle today?

61
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,680
Smallish? Three inches long? Tapered?

62
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,960
It could be Reinhardt glass, you know,
from Rotterdam, before the war.

63
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,520
- It didn't look like...
- We didn't find any bottle.

64
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,080
Wait...

65
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,120
My name is Henri Bondurant.

66
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,840
A jeweler by trade.

67
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,560
By avocation, a collector
of rare and unusual glass.

68
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,320
You see...

69
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,920
...the government here has rather
strict rules about diving.

70
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,520
Legally, you cannot take
anything off Bermuda...

71
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,080
...unless you first offer it
to the government and they decline.

72
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,040
Unfortunately, the government
rarely ever declines...

73
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,400
...and even more rarely
offers premium prices.

74
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,800
What was your name?

75
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,120
Bondurant.

76
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,680
Well...

77
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,720
...l'm sorry. This is fascinating,
but what does it have to do with us?

78
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,080
Let me tell you something.

79
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,920
If that bottle is a genuine Reinhardt...

80
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,880
...it would be a small coup
for a collector like myself.

81
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,920
I would be prepared to offer...

82
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,680
I'm sorry. I told you,
we don't have any bottle.

83
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,080
In that case...

84
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,480
...my apologies for having interrupted
your conversation.

85
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,920
Good night.

86
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,240
Good night.

87
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,280
Jesus, who was that?

88
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,320
Some dynamite businessman you are.
You could've listened to his offer.

89
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,240
Come on, Gail!
Bottle collector, my ass!

90
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,680
Is this it?

91
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,680
Well, it isn't a bloody tourist trap.

92
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
What do you want?

93
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,640
- Mr. Treece?
- Indeed.

94
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,920
A friend of ours was doing some diving
around here about a month ago...

95
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,520
...and found a Spanish coin.
It was dated 1 71 4.

96
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,520
And he told us to talk to you.

97
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,080
- Look it up in the Hamilton Library.
- We did, and we talked to the librarian.

98
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,120
She said to come out here
because you'd help us.

99
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,520
Yes, well, she's a stupid woman.

100
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,000
But she's kind, you know. Quite kind.

101
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,200
Is she still growing her mustache?

102
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,120
Come on in.
Let's see what you've got.

103
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,400
Come on over, then.
But you haven't been asked for lunch.

104
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,560
Thank you.

105
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,440
Well, it ain't no coin, boy.
It's a Spanish medallion.

106
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,080
It's a medallion?

107
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,880
Beginner's luck.

108
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,960
If this hadn't laid against iron,
it would've oxidized a long time ago.

109
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,800
We can't figure out the inscription
ora pro nobis and "S.C." in front.

110
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,280
"Santa Clara pray for us." That was
a common inscription in those days.

111
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,200
There you are, boy.

112
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,680
Is it valuable?

113
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,480
One medallion? No, not to me.

114
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,760
It must be one
of King Philip's treasure.

115
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,960
That's the only fleet
that went down then.

116
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,400
Not unless it walked itself
across the ocean 800 miles.

117
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,400
That fleet went down in a hurricane
off Florida. All 11 of them. 1715.

118
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,720
That's all documented in my library.

119
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,000
They've already found El Capitano,
Ubilla's flagship.

120
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,640
There's something down here also,
isn't there?

121
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,280
Now just hang on a bit, boy.
You just found one trinket.

122
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,840
Might be enough to pay for your holiday.

123
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,760
Or it might've just
fallen overboard...

124
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,280
...dropped there by some
drunken old rummy.

125
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,880
What else
have you got in there, then?

126
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,280
Hey, boy, this is Goliath trash.

127
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,080
What the hell were you doing
diving there?

128
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,080
We spotted the wreck
off the point, so we dived down.

129
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,880
Where'd you get this, exactly?

130
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Right here. Just outside the wreck.

131
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,600
You quite sure?

132
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,600
The water plays tricks. It makes things
look bigger, smaller, wrong way around.

133
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,960
- Are you sure it was there?
- I'm positive.

134
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,320
Sure a lot of glass freaks
in Bermuda.

135
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,480
Somebody else know about this?

136
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,600
A bald guy came up to us
and said he was a glass collector.

137
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,600
He described that perfectly.

138
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,200
I didn't show it to him.

139
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,560
Looked like a basketball player.

140
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,640
Henri Bondurant. French guy.

141
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,560
No, he's Haitian.

142
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,160
Boy, could I just have another little
look at that medallion there?

143
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,080
I think I might just have...

144
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,120
...missed something here.

145
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,960
Come over here, and let's have
a look with this magnifying glass.

146
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,400
Yeah.

147
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,040
See those letters?
That's not your normal mint mark.

148
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,600
It might be the mark of the engraver
or the person who had it made up.

149
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,680
I'm sure of one thing.

150
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,560
It's made up for somebody special.

151
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,360
Then it might be worth
another look down there.

152
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Yes, well, as I said, it might...

153
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,960
...but not to me.

154
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,960
Thank you.
Sorry you can't stay for lunch.

155
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,000
Wait a minute. That's all?

156
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,760
- Let's go.
- Just a second.

157
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,120
You might not mind wasting your time,
but I can't have you wasting mine.

158
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,760
You said there's something special.
Let's look!

159
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,560
Good afternoon!

160
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,160
You okay?

161
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,840
Go right!

162
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,080
I wonder what this guy's doing? I

163
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,120
Try and pull over!

164
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,840
I can't!

165
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,160
You should have sold me that bottle.

166
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,240
Now you've forced me to take
what you would not let me pay for.

167
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,280
If it'll ease your mind,
I'll still name a price.

168
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,360
Take off their blindfolds.

169
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,160
Look, if it's not in the bag,
I don't know where it is.

170
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,000
The girl.

171
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,160
Now, look, she hasn't got it!

172
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,280
If his tongue moves, cut it!

173
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,520
I'll do it.

174
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,200
Put it back on.

175
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,880
Since neither of you seem
to have that bottle, I assume...

176
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,800
...it is now the property
of Romer Treece.

177
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,760
Well, then, for Christ's sake,
let him go!

178
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,080
It hasn't been all that pleasant
for you, has it Mr. Sanders?

179
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,560
Enjoy yourselves this evening.

180
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,160
Eat a good dinner.

181
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,360
Go dancing.

182
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,760
But be off the island by tomorrow.

183
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,800
Treece!

184
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,560
Come on, Treece!

185
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,560
All right, what the hell's going on?

186
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,040
Take it up.

187
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,360
We'll take it out right after this.

188
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,840
Coffin?

189
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,160
He's the only man alive who might know
one of these ampoules on sight.

190
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,120
Can I show him your map?

191
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,200
He's the sole survivor
of the Goliath, you see.

192
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,920
Thank you.

193
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,160
Now, then, Adam...

194
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,360
...this one of your legendary ampoules?

195
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,960
It's the real thing, all right.

196
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,160
The old girl's finally
lost her virginity.

197
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,360
My friends found it there.

198
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,760
The way she's lying,
the storm must've flipped her around.

199
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,280
She was never this close
to the edge of the reef before.

200
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,560
You're lucky.

201
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,200
Five people have died
over the last 30 years...

202
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,760
...trying to crawl inside that ship.

203
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,280
Blew themselves up
poking torches around.

204
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,800
There's enough live ammo there
to blow up the island.

205
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,240
Will somebody cut the crap?
Blew themselves up for what?

206
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,000
It was a military ship. It went down
with munitions and medical supplies.

207
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,560
Or so they say.

208
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,800
They're there.

209
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,320
All right, what's there?

210
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,320
Morphine.

211
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,960
Ninety-eight thousand ampoules.

212
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,000
I packed them myself.

213
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,360
Jesus, why didn't you tell us the truth?

214
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,440
We wouldn't have had that run-in
with the Haitian.

215
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,800
The name's Cloche.

216
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,200
The fact that you knew nothing
saved you.

217
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,760
I wasn't sure myself until now.

218
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,760
It's the first time
he's told me the truth!

219
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,720
Adam, what do you reckon happened
to the rest of them, then?

220
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,560
They're probably all smashed up
by the ordnance now.

221
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,560
The way she's lying, there won't be any
steel plate to have to burrow through.

222
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,560
They've performed an autopsy on it
with everything but forceps...

223
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,760
...but nobody found one of those before.

224
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,360
We found one.

225
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,160
Well, we are having a wonderful day,
aren't we?

226
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,760
How come nobody found one?

227
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,640
The sea's a joke, my boy.
Loves to fool you.

228
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,360
Dive one day, you find nothing.
That night, it blows up a storm.

229
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,960
Go back again, the same spot,
you find a carpet of golden coin.

230
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,800
We just had one of the worst storms
we had in 10 years, haven't we?

231
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,040
Coffin?

232
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,160
Goddamn it! Coffin!

233
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,160
"Coffin! Goddamn it! Coffin!"

234
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,200
Nice to meet you folks.

235
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,840
Mr. Treece, which one of us turns
this over to the government?

236
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,120
Well, now, miss,
I'm gonna have to think on that.

237
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,840
I was never much one to bother
with formalities.

238
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,000
Morphine's not exactly a "formality."
It's halfway to heroin.

239
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,080
Halfway to hell.

240
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,280
I know all about that. So does Cloche.

241
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,800
By the time a Hamilton bureaucrat gets
off of his fat bum, it will be heroin.

242
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,720
That's why I'm gonna dive there tonight.

243
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,720
You haven't answered my question.

244
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,960
I'll answer.
I'm turning this over to the government.

245
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,880
I'm all the government you need, boyl

246
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,800
Put that right back.

247
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,880
The reasons are two:
mine and yours.

248
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,080
Mine:

249
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,240
If there are thousands of ampoules there
and Cloche gets them...

250
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,200
...that junk will be on the street
in N.Y. in a week.

251
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,440
Yours: If you're lucky,
that's the only one left.

252
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,360
If you go to the government,
your treasure hunt will be off.

253
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,520
And if there is any treasure...

254
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,160
...you'll just be reading
about somebody else finding it.

255
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,360
David, please don't dive.

256
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,360
Make up your own mind, boy.

257
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,440
I have made up my mind.

258
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,800
I'm diving with you tonight...

259
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,720
...or otherwise I'm handing over
this information to the authorities.

260
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,080
Look, Gail, it's important to me.
You understand?

261
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,280
David, it's morphine. Morphine!

262
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,800
We only met the man today.
You don't know anything about him.

263
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,200
- I can't pass it up. It's an experience.
- Experience?

264
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,800
Don't you mean privilege?
He suckered you in like a child!

265
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,760
I blackmailed him, remember?

266
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,640
- Is that the way you remember it?
- Yes, because that's the way it was!

267
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,640
There's treasure down there. I know.
I've gotta look.

268
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,160
You're so blind! You wouldn't
see it if it was in front of you!

269
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,960
I feel things so I do them!
That's the way I am!

270
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,160
And you wind up with T-shirts!

271
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,960
Jesus, that's unfair.
That's totally unfair.

272
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,200
Look, I didn't come here for you.
I came here for us!

273
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,160
Would you please think about it?

274
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,160
I always think about us.

275
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,200
Say, who is that guy?
I don't like him at all.

276
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,600
Learn to like him, because
that's Kevin. He's family.

277
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,960
My mother liked him.
Told him to look after me.

278
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,960
Put your gear in the cabin.

279
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,640
Well, here I am!

280
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,480
I'm all ready! I've got all my gear!

281
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,560
I'm sorry you had such a long walk.
You're not diving tonight.

282
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,360
The hell I'm not!

283
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,760
That's my ship out there!
Those are my mates!

284
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,360
Your ship's dead. So are your mates.

285
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,040
So were you,
when I found you on the beach.

286
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,760
But there's never the bringing
any of us back, is there?

287
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,400
Just go on home now.

288
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,360
Good night.

289
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,560
All set, Kevin?

290
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,160
Full moon tonight. We're gonna
stick out like a cherry on a cream pie.

291
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,160
Cast her off forward, Kev.

292
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,280
Would you like some rum?

293
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,160
Yeah.

294
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,960
- Here you go.
- I never drink before I dive.

295
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,000
You know what they say
about these waters?

296
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,400
If the Jamaican pirates don't get you...

297
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,560
...it'll be the cold embrace of the sea.

298
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,360
And that's no lover's kiss.

299
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,800
Every ship from the new world
passed through these waters.

300
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,400
They had to.

301
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,960
K'ang Hsi porcelain from China.

302
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,600
Japanese silk-screens.

303
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,680
And those ivory doodads from India.

304
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,960
And all that Inca gold
that Pizarro took out of Peru.

305
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,160
Do you believe all that, boy?

306
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,560
Yeah, I believe all of it.

307
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,560
Every bit of it. So do you.

308
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,760
You gonna marry that girl of yours?

309
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,840
Hey, boy.

310
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,240
We're getting very close.

311
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,400
Four dots and a dash, that's your hotel.

312
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,440
Hey, Treece.

313
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,720
What do you do on a foggy night?

314
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,960
I just stay home and I drink rum.

315
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,760
Here.

316
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,560
Give me a hand, will you?

317
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,760
Wait a minute. I don't want to have
anything to do with explosives.

318
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,880
If there are thousands of ampoules
down there...

319
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,760
I'm gonna rig the Goliath...

320
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,640
...so that I topple her off the reef,
out of anybody's reach forever.

321
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,240
What about the treasure?

322
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,160
Here, you'll need this.
It's black as molasses.

323
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,160
Don't you go threatening
anything down there.

324
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,680
What's wrong?

325
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,120
I'm not blowing it. Not now.

326
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,600
That's the biggest moray eel
I ever saw!

327
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,880
He wanted you for his supper.

328
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,480
What's the matter, boy?

329
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,320
Cheap Jack Bush.
Warning from Cloche.

330
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,120
Cheap Jack what?

331
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,920
Voodoo. Cloche always likes
to bring in a bit of Haiti with him.

332
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,480
Anybody take any notice of this...

333
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,080
...ought to have his brain examined.

334
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,280
The lights in your hotel
have gone out.

335
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,280
We'll run the reef
and drop you on the beach.

336
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,240
Get that anchor up.
Keep a sharp eye!

337
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,320
David?

338
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,480
Just a minute.
I've put the lock on.

339
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,680
Who's there?

340
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,840
- You gotta go starboard.
- Port! Port!

341
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,840
I've been through this reef before.

342
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,400
Yeah, but the hotel beach
is over there!

343
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,680
I know where the bloody beach is!

344
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,280
Okay, you're clear!

345
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,200
Honey, what happened?

346
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,200
I've never...

347
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,200
...felt like that...

348
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,800
...in my entire life!

349
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,200
I was so helpless!

350
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,400
All right.

351
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,240
They...

352
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,000
They painted me.

353
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,040
Quiet.

354
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,800
They painted...

355
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,160
Come on. Listen, listen.

356
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,880
- I wanna go home.
- Okay, baby.

357
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,840
We'll go home tonight.

358
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,560
The airport's closed.

359
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,000
No way off the island.
You'd best come home with me.

360
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,920
I'm not going home with you, Treece.

361
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,640
Because it's you and it's Cloche...

362
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,200
...and it's that morphine
that almost got her killed tonight!

363
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,600
Boy, if Cloche wanted her dead,
we'd be digging her grave by now.

364
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,560
He just wanted her
as some kind of trump card...

365
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,200
...until he knew about the morphine.

366
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,720
Come home with me. St. David is
the only place you'll be safe tonight.

367
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,520
Don't worry. I'll make sure
everyone's placed properly.

368
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,040
Right. But you watch the west side.

369
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,720
Make sure nobody comes
over the swing bridge.

370
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,800
If he does come,
I hope it's my bloody way.

371
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,600
Kevin?

372
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,600
Take care of yourself.

373
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,600
I don't want anybody else
to be hurt tonight. Go on!

374
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,600
How's your girl?

375
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,000
She's asleep.

376
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,800
Why didn't you blow that boat up?

377
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:07,400
Because of what you found, boy. I think
you ought to have a look at this.

378
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,840
I never seen one like that before.

379
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,480
That's an 18th-century
escutcheon plate.

380
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:23,600
You might be right. There just might be
a king's ransom down there.

381
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,400
It would take three keys to open
the box that that plate came from.

382
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,440
The captain would have one.

383
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,400
The governor of Havana had two.

384
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,880
Only the owner would have all three.

385
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,800
So only the owner could open it
on his own, right?

386
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,680
Three-key lock like that is very rare.
Very rare, indeed.

387
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,400
Only used on nobility business.

388
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,680
What would a plate like this be doing
in a World War II munition ship?

389
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,400
Yes, well, now...

390
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,400
I don't know.

391
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,320
Suppose you have two storms...

392
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:10,440
...hundreds of years apart,
springing up from the same quarter...

393
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:15,160
...and they catch two ships,
making for the same shelter.

394
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,200
Might they not drive them up
on the same reef?

395
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:24,280
You think the current could bring that
plate up through a split in the hull?

396
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,880
Why hasn't anybody found it?

397
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:31,840
I don't know, but we're gonna
find it in the Havana manifest.

398
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,280
I got survivors' accounts.

399
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:37,440
I ought to be able to tell you
who that ship is, where she come from.

400
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,200
These are the Spanish.
This is the translation.

401
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,200
You and your beginner's luck.

402
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,720
If there is something,
what would it take to bring it up?

403
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,280
Well, under normal circumstances...

404
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,840
...using a sand gun
and DESCO equipment...

405
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:00,200
...clear water and a lot of luck,
just a few days.

406
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:04,240
But that hardly applies now,
since we've got Cloche on our back.

407
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,600
What would it take to get him off?

408
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,200
Any deal that gets him the morphine,
I suppose.

409
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,000
But what do you care? You're both
going home tomorrow, aren't you?

410
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:21,960
You'll be up to your neck in city smut
by dinnertimel What a world that is!

411
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,000
They made me climb
the Statue of Liberty once.

412
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,000
It's dreams, Treece.

413
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,920
It's all daydreams.

414
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,200
It's more than daydreams
when you find a three-lock box.

415
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,080
By rights, you discovered her.

416
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,200
Whoever she is,
you were the first to find her.

417
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,200
But you would have left that plate there
if I hadn't known it for what it was.

418
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,200
So that rolls me aboard as well.

419
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,400
Let me put it to you simple:

420
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:10,120
Whatever's down there, a lot
or a little, half yours, half mine...

421
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:14,000
...but the right to tell the world
about it, that's all yours.

422
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,600
Come on to bed.

423
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,400
All right, in a minute. I'm coming.

424
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,280
You still there, girl?

425
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,200
Like a jar?

426
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,600
It'll warm you up.

427
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,800
Anyway...

428
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,800
...rum is not drinking, it's surviving.

429
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,400
You know what's got me stumped?

430
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,440
This is the Havana manifest
right here.

431
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:14,120
It's signed by the king's man
in Havana, the Marqués of Cazaterras...

432
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,720
...governor of Cuba.

433
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:20,040
It states here that, "...entire fleet
sunk off the coast of Florida in 1 715."

434
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:24,200
That's King Philip's Fleet, 1 715.
Every ship, right?

435
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,000
All itemized. All recorded.

436
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,200
So what I don't understand is...

437
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,320
...what is this ship
doing in these waters...

438
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:37,440
...un-itemized, unrecorded, unescorted...

439
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,000
...and carrying a three-lock box?

440
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,200
He's all right, that David of yours.

441
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,000
Yeah, I know.

442
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,000
I'm sorry.

443
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,560
I apologize.

444
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,200
I lost touch why
we even came down here.

445
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,800
I'll take you home.

446
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,800
You don't want to go home tomorrow.

447
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,000
I don't wanna stay here without you.

448
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,560
Say that again.

449
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,600
I don't wanna stay here without you.

450
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,600
Go away, will you?

451
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,400
That was a stupid business last night.
And cruel. Very cruel.

452
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,840
You did not go to the police.

453
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:13,600
I've been tossing and turning
all night, wondering why.

454
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:18,840
Because there's thousands of ampoules
of morphine down there.

455
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:21,200
You want them, and I got them.

456
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:27,360
They're still on the Goliath. You have
nothing but the gall to claim ownership.

457
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,240
I rigged that ship
with booby traps last night.

458
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,640
She's wired 10 ways to hell. The wrong
person goes there, she'll blow.

459
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,600
You'd need an advantage...

460
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,800
...to deal with me.

461
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,600
I'll expect them in two days.

462
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,600
No, I shall need four.

463
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,600
We seemed to have settled on three.

464
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:00,600
What sort of fee are you getting
for diving these days?

465
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:04,840
One million dollars, cash,
low denominations. That's my share.

466
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,920
You'll make twice as much as that
in America.

467
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:14,080
Your attitude on drugs
is a matter of record.

468
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,600
Why sell them to me for a profit?

469
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,360
I have my reasons.

470
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:26,200
I don't want any interference in
this dive. I know you'll be watching.

471
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,240
The young couple's my responsibility.

472
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,400
You keep your hands off them.

473
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,800
If you want me...

474
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:36,200
...you come and see me this time.
You know where I live.

475
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,920
Three days, Treece.

476
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,400
Three days.

477
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,320
Afternoon, Mr. Cloche.

478
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,400
Thank you, Kev.

479
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,800
Now then, listen you two.

480
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,400
When this air gun gets going...

481
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,680
...I want you on my right
and you on my left, girl.

482
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:16,440
We pick up the ampoules
as the sand gets sucked away.

483
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,400
Be very careful of your hands.

484
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,240
When this thing's on full,
it can swallow a cannon ball.

485
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,000
How much of that junk
are we gonna bring up?

486
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:29,200
Just enough to satisfy our audience
up there on the cliff.

487
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,440
They're there, all right.

488
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:40,200
That Kevin sure gives me the willies.
He doesn't say much.

489
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,080
Maybe he don't like you, Adam.
He likes me.

490
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:48,320
He's family. You just watch that
little lever on that compressor there.

491
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,600
Turn it off if there's any real trouble,
but don't forget to turn it on again.

492
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:56,840
You feel that breeze cutting out
of your hose, come up. But be careful.

493
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:00,520
It's possible there might be
somebody waiting up there for you.

494
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,640
It should be me going down there.

495
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,640
Let's not go into it again.

496
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,520
I got enough trouble
looking after the boy here.

497
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:10,480
Don't worry.
I'm gonna go slow enough for you.

498
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,240
I'm going in!

499
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,040
Gail's behind us.

500
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:02,200
Get closer! I can't hear you!
You'll have to shout!

501
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,200
All right, David.
Now keep those air hoses clear.

502
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:38,720
Right.

503
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,120
You go down. I'll be right behind you.

504
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,800
Wait! Wait!

505
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,800
That's where we saw the eel.

506
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,760
Come on.

507
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:15,000
David, bring it
into the next compartment!

508
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,600
Keep your hands clear, girl!

509
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:57,560
That's enough.
Let's go look for the treasure.

510
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,960
Let's go look for the treasure!

511
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,240
All right!

512
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,640
Goliath is moving!

513
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,240
Kevin!

514
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,560
Girl, you wait! I'll go!

515
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,120
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

516
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,360
Look what I found! Look!

517
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,600
I don't care!
That was a bloody amateur thing to do!

518
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,360
I had to take my mask off.
I couldn't reach it!

519
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,560
Damn it, look at it!

520
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,960
Gail, look. It's gold!

521
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,960
I knew there was treasure down here!

522
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,160
What kind of a ship was it?

523
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,240
Probably Spanish.

524
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,200
Might be a galleon.

525
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,960
Till you fell through the Goliath...

526
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,640
...this cave was all sealed up.

527
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,640
That tunnel I pulled you out of...

528
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:32,160
...it probably leads right down
to the bottom of the reef.

529
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,400
Let's get out of here.

530
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,160
Goliath is on the move again.
It'll cut our hoses.

531
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:53,160
Up now! Up! Up!

532
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,200
- How many do you reckon we have?
- About 4,000.

533
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,960
Here you go, Kev.

534
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,960
Explosives?
What the hell you doing that for?

535
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,600
- I'm rigging this.
- What the hell for?

536
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,400
This is the first place
anybody'd look for them.

537
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:21,400
If you'd hide them somewhere else, you
wouldn't have to blow your house up.

538
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:25,360
If I hide them somewhere else, they
wouldn't know where to look for them.

539
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,480
I'm only gonna
keep the buggers two days.

540
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,240
Kev...

541
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:41,360
You stay ashore from now on.
Somebody's got to watch this place.

542
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,000
Right.

543
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:48,680
The hell! It still makes no sense!

544
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,600
What?

545
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:58,160
We know that the Grifon is the wreck
underneath the Goliath, right?

546
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,600
Right.

547
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,560
But it says here in the manifest...

548
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:07,520
...that the Grifon was a tobacco
ship with a French captain, Dare.

549
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:11,200
It tagged along with the 1715
fleet for protection from pirates.

550
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,880
That's here in the manifest.

551
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,560
You know what interests me?

552
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:19,440
The Grifon was the only ship
to survive the hurricane.

553
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:21,240
She went back for repairs.

554
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:26,360
But what's she doing off of Bermuda
with part of that fleet's treasure?

555
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:30,800
I don't know! That's what I keep trying
to puzzle out, because it says here:

556
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:35,080
"The entire fleet went down
off Florida together, all 11 ships."

557
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,160
They say the fleet treasure
was aboard the flagship.

558
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,160
The manifests prove it!

559
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:47,960
Governor Cazaterrass, the king's man
in Havana, reports everything's lost.

560
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,280
- Maybe he's wrong.
- No.

561
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:56,880
What we found is jewelry. We didn't
find the gold and silver from the fleet.

562
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:01,240
Jewelry and a Spanish three-lock box
on a French tagalong tobacco ship.

563
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:04,200
Well, someone could be lying.
Could be lying!

564
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,000
The Spanish were fanatics
for accurate records.

565
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:11,480
They always had everything checked and
rechecked by some important official.

566
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:12,840
Here it is again.

567
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,520
What?

568
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,960
"E.F."

569
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:25,600
Look at that!

570
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,760
What's something like that worth?

571
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:34,640
I don't know what you got there.
Eight or nine ounces, 22 karat gold.

572
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,160
Good pearls.

573
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,800
Play it quiet, maybe
$7,500 on the market.

574
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,080
Less breakdown and melting costs.

575
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,280
You wouldn't melt it down,
would you?

576
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,760
I wouldn't,
but there are those who would.

577
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:51,960
The ocean's not a jewelry store.
You don't get no receipts.

578
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,680
Gotta prove it's authentic.

579
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,360
Anybody can see it's authentic.

580
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:58,600
You don't understand me.
There's a lot of counterfeit.

581
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,960
It's real gold, it's real gems,
but it's false.

582
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,600
You have to establish a provenance.

583
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:08,640
You gotta find out proof
that it's real.

584
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:14,040
If we could find a verifying record or
a description of any piece down there...

585
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,840
...that makes it all
worth a bloody fortune.

586
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:22,120
You wanna have your name on a plaque?
You wanna be a celebrity?

587
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,960
No, there's not enough room
in the Hamilton Library.

588
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:29,080
I think they could find
a bit of room for you, boy.

589
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:33,400
Well, it's just possible
there's something else going on...

590
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:36,160
...but I don't know what it is.

591
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:44,000
You can beat it out of me,
but it won't do you any good.

592
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,400
I merely need information.

593
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,760
Which brings us, of course,
to your fee.

594
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,160
How much is Treece paying you,
by the way?

595
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,760
I'll pay 10 percent.

596
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,560
Done.

597
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,200
How many did they get today?

598
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,560
Six...

599
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,160
Four thousand or so.

600
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,760
And yet Treece claims
they're all down there?

601
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,440
That's what the girl says, yes.

602
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:32,760
It almost seems as if Treece
is hiding something from both of us.

603
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,560
Doesn't it, my friend?

604
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:45,160
And we can't have partners
that double-cross us, can we?

605
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,720
David?

606
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,160
You know, maybe you were right.

607
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,760
I think somebody was lying.
Do you know who I think it is?

608
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,160
The governor of Havana.

609
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,760
Come here, have a look at this.

610
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,800
This is the list he sent back to Spain,
reporting the goods lost in the storm.

611
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,960
But according to this list...

612
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:17,960
...more was lost than the fleet's
sailing manifest said was sent.

613
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,760
You know the difference?
The difference is jewels.

614
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,760
Not trinkets, mind you.
Masterpieces. Works of art.

615
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,360
Two pages were lost. They never got to
Seville. That's where the original is.

616
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,360
You listen.

617
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:39,480
" A team of silver horses
pulling a golden carriage.

618
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:43,720
A pair of jade hummingbirds,
one with wings of emeralds...

619
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:48,480
...the other with wings of pearls.
A golden dragon with emerald eyes."

620
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,960
Does it say anything
about what we found?

621
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:55,360
Like the pine cone filled with pearls?
Or the medallion itself?

622
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,960
No, not on that page.

623
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:02,800
You know something? This doesn't
even look like a proper manifest to me.

624
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,440
It's not a manifest.
It's a shopping list.

625
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,680
- For a woman.
- For what?

626
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:10,360
It's a shopping list for a woman.

627
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,360
Gentlemen, I give you "E.F."I

628
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,560
- The lady on the medallion.
- The Duchess of Parma.

629
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:23,080
Come on, Gail.
We've got an "E.F.", not a "D.P."

630
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:26,880
The Duchess of Parma was her title.
Elisabeth Farnese was her name.

631
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,400
Get on with it.

632
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:33,400
It seems that in 1 71 4, when King
Philip's first wife had just died...

633
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:38,400
...he developed a royal lust
for the beautiful Duchess of Parma.

634
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:43,160
She finally agreed to marry him
by proxy. But he wasn't there yet.

635
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,360
She wasn't a woman who gave
away something for nothing...

636
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:47,680
...like her virginity.

637
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:52,800
Before he could touch that, she insisted
that he deck her up with jewels...

638
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,760
...quote, "Unique in all the world,"
unquote.

639
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,400
Philip commissioned
those jewels to be made.

640
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:02,520
And if that's what we found,
he never got laid.

641
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,240
Beautiful! Just beautiful!

642
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,160
Yeah, she was a pretty smart lady.

643
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:13,280
In three years, all he's ever given me
is a sweater and a pair of sneakers.

644
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:18,360
Well, he isn't the king of Spain,
is he, girl?

645
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:19,840
What do you think?

646
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:23,440
Well...

647
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:27,160
Thinking aloud...

648
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:31,480
...suppose you were the governor
of Havana, with a three-lock box...

649
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:36,560
...and you knew it had something
so valuable, belonging to the king...

650
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:42,000
...you might not put it
on a prime target like a flagship.

651
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:44,400
You might put it on a tobacco ship.

652
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:46,800
The fleet was there
for protection...

653
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:50,600
...but the whole fleet sank,
except the French tobacco ship.

654
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,160
And the governor keeps to his story...

655
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,600
...and he lists the box
as lost along with the fleet.

656
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,280
I'll buy it.

657
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:03,000
The Grifon sails again into
another hurricane off Bermuda...

658
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,080
...and it sinks.

659
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:09,200
The poor old governor has to go back to
Madrid and live on his pension, right?

660
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:15,840
You know, girl, if we could
just find one item down there...

661
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,760
...just one that's
on your shopping list...

662
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,360
...we've found our bloody provenance!

663
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,960
That's why he wouldn't let me dive.

664
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,560
Damn you, Treece.

665
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:30,160
"E.F."I
It's "E.F." again!

666
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,960
Treece! Treece!

667
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,480
Up! Up! Everybody up!

668
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,800
The both of you! Move!

669
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,200
Let me get this first.

670
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:43,640
Get up!

671
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:47,240
- Let me get this first!
- I don't care what you found, boy!

672
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,360
Gail, get the dredge!

673
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:49,360
Our only chance is
to go up with the bubbles.

674
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:54,160
Take all the breath you can. I'm
cutting the air hoses, so stay calm.

675
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:43,160
What the hell happened up here?

676
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:46,560
Old Fellini came by in his boat.
He was all rummed up.

677
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:51,600
I must have been dozing. When I looked
out, all that stuff in the water...

678
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:53,320
Sharks were everywhere!

679
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,280
Why not warn us
on the compressor?

680
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:57,280
I was going to turn it on!

681
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,960
But then I knew you wouldn't know
what kind of trouble you was in.

682
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:04,480
And I might send you up right into them.

683
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:06,960
Thank God, you came through.

684
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:18,720
I knew there was more
than morphine down there.

685
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:23,400
All those ampoules coming up
so slow like they were.

686
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,760
Yes, that's right, Adam.

687
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,160
I might have saved your life
for something after all.

688
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,160
Hey, boy!

689
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:36,000
There'll be no more diving today,
not with all those sharks flying around.

690
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,200
All right, once again.
Just for the hell of it, all right?

691
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,560
I'm too tired.

692
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:49,200
Let's face it,
we haven't got our provenance.

693
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,920
The jewelry we saw must be
on those missing pages.

694
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:55,480
Let's go over it again,
just for the hell of it. All right?

695
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:58,160
All right.
Give me a rum, would you?

696
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,400
One gold and ruby-studded cross...

697
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:17,960
Good morning.

698
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:32,360
Kevin?

699
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:53,160
Four tanks. They need filling.

700
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:56,160
Treece is expecting me.
They all up there?

701
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:57,760
Aye, they're there.

702
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:57,960
Gail, let me see
your sketch of the Grifon.

703
01:39:58,560 --> 01:39:59,960
It's in my bag.

704
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:06,360
- Is there any fresh coffee?
- Yeah, it's on the table.

705
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:11,960
This is the medallion.
I want the original one. The Goliath.

706
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,760
- It's in there too.
- No, it's not in here.

707
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,160
- It must be.
- Well, you come look.

708
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,160
You're right, it's not.

709
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:31,360
Adam...

710
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:35,560
...I think I'll take a breath of air.

711
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:39,560
Do you mind locking up after me?

712
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:50,520
Thank you.

713
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:46,600
Jesus, that's it. That is it!

714
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:48,680
- What?
- I've seen this.

715
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:51,400
I mean, I've seen
part of this down there.

716
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,400
You've seen what?

717
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:58,560
She's wearing a dragon pendant, but
when you drew these lines right here...

718
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,880
...I thought that was part of her dress.

719
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:04,920
I've seen this chain.
I've seen this chain down there.

720
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:07,200
I was trying to get it
when the sharks came.

721
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:11,760
On the list, there's something
about gold chains. Chains of gold.

722
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:20,720
There's nothing here.

723
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:22,640
Yes. Yes, there is.

724
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:25,240
There is a dragon pendant.

725
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,760
- A gold dragon with emerald eyes.
- That's it!

726
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:31,200
The jeweler that made this pendant
also made this medallion.

727
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:35,480
If I go there and I find the chain, and
the dragon's at the end of the chain...

728
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:39,960
...then we got our proof, babe.
We've got our proof!

729
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:47,320
Kev?

730
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:54,920
Treece, we solved it!
It was here all along.

731
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:58,120
It's the provenance!
David's seen part of it down there.

732
01:43:58,320 --> 01:43:59,720
You've solved nothing.

733
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,320
What are you talking about?

734
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:03,920
I'm gonna blow the Goliath now.

735
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:05,440
Why now?

736
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:12,800
Because if anything happens to me,
there's nobody else left to do it.

737
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:23,920
What do you mean,
if anything happens to you?

738
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:32,040
All right, you go ahead
and blow the Goliath.

739
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:34,440
But first I'm getting that provenance.

740
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:40,200
Go upstairs, pack and go home.

741
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:43,560
To hell with it, Treece.
I'm not doing that!

742
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:47,640
I'm going down there. And you're
gonna have to blow me up tool

743
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:51,320
As you please, boy.

744
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:54,520
Excuse me.

745
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:03,360
You don't need me down there, do you?

746
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,720
No, I don't think I do.

747
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:11,000
Coffin...?

748
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:13,920
They killed Kevin.

749
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:36,560
I'm gonna signal you
when I fire this fuse.

750
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:39,800
After that, I don't care
if you've found the Holy Grail.

751
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:41,480
You've got three minutes...

752
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,320
...so get out!

753
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:54,800
Don't worry. Just turn on the
air dredge when I get in, all right?

754
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:56,720
I'll be all right.

755
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:44,520
David! Treece?

756
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,120
David! Here!
