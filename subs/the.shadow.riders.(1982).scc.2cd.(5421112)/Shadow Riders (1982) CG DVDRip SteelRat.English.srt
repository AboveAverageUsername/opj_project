00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,945
"April 1865.

4
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,199
"Dear Ma and Pa, I hope
this letter finds you well.

5
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,869
"I have some good news. Word
is the war may be over soon.

6
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,330
"I tell you, if there's
one thing I've learnt...

7
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,874
"it's the Travens ain't the
only family split by this war...

8
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,501
"brother against brother.

9
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:29,130
"I just keep fearing, one day I might look
down my sight and find Dal across from me.

10
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:33,510
"I hear little brother Jesse signed up,
too, but nobody's told me which side.

11
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:37,639
"Kiss Heather and Sissy for me,
and don't fret none, I'm fine.

12
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:41,726
"Right now I'm somewhere in Georgia,
and since I've been made Captain...

13
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,521
"the burdens of
responsibility have been heavy.

14
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,982
"It's a dirty job, but
somebody's got to do it.

15
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,568
"Your loving son, Mac."

16
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,739
You feeling good, honey?

17
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,659
Yeah.

18
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,413
I hope you'll be staying
around here for a while.

19
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,792
Oh, I'm afraid not. I think
we're gonna be pulling out soon.

20
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,255
I'm sorry to hear that.
I was hoping that...

21
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,508
we could get to know each
other a little bit better.

22
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:18,263
Well, darling, I am afraid that
is one of the curses of war.

23
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:23,518
You meet somebody and you only got
one night to really get to know them.

24
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,229
One night?

25
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,860
I love soothing a man.

26
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:38,324
Oh, just imagine these poor old feet
of yours marched clear across Georgia.

27
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,201
Marched? I'm in the cavalry.

28
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,288
All that hard riding
clear across Georgia.

29
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:45,373
And Virginia.

30
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,710
Not to mention Tennessee.

31
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,671
Then I got my geography all wrong.

32
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,556
- Who is it?
- Sgt. Ballock, sir.

33
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,144
- Go away.
- It's important, sir.

34
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,313
Nothing can be that important.

35
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,858
Lee's surrendered, sir.

36
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,444
Come in.

37
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,824
Sergeant...

38
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,118
what about the war?

39
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,913
Excuse me, Captain. A courier just
rode in. Straight from General Grant.

40
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,373
The war is over.

41
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,754
The men are anxious to celebrate,
Captain, and they're waiting on you.

42
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,384
Tell them I'll be right along.

43
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,744
Squad, halt!

44
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,954
Right face!

45
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,224
Would you like a blindfold?

46
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:30,853
- I'd like to know why I'm being shot.
- For blowing up an ammo depot, a train.

47
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,606
Of course I did, you dumb
knobhead, I'm a soldier.

48
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:37,318
- You've been found guilty.
- I don't recall no trial.

49
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,288
Squad, attention.

50
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,333
Ready.

51
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,254
Aim.

52
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,188
Hold your hands out!

53
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,468
Thank you, Major.

54
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,596
I'm glad you fellas happened along.

55
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,266
Couldn't let you get shot, Traven.
You're too good a fighting man.

56
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,103
- Where you fellas bound?
- We're crossing the Mississippi.

57
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,731
Lick our wounds, gather ourselves...

58
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,859
try to get back some
of that old swagger...

59
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,944
and come back fighting.

60
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:06,741
- I'd like you to ride with us.
- No, sir.

61
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,829
The first thing I'm gonna do is lie down
somewhere and die for a couple of days.

62
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,539
Then I'm heading back to Texas.

63
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,750
Gonna work the land, try to
make something out of it...

64
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,460
instead of blowing it all to hell.

65
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:21,505
At least you have a home to go
back to. Most of these men don't.

66
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,840
- Lieutenant.
- Sir.

67
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,926
- Bring up that runaway for Sergeant Traven.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,188
Good luck, Sergeant.

69
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,566
Thank you, Major. For everything.

70
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,028
I figure you'll be needing this, too.

71
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,907
Well, looky there.

72
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:20,726
You get the horse.

73
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:36,700
You sure you want to do this?

74
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:42,539
Well, maybe we ought to talk about it.

75
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:51,548
Weren't nice of you fellas, trying
to steal another man's horse.

76
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,700
Hey, Crystal, how about
getting in here with me?

77
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,037
You should be so lucky.

78
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,090
How you doing, honey?

79
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,630
Any law hereabouts?

80
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,441
In my part of Texas
we hang horse thieves.

81
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,401
If rope isn't handy,
we just shoot them.

82
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:38,405
Mister, I'm afraid you
really went and did it.

83
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:45,454
Those two men you're saying
are horse thieves are our kin.

84
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,798
Not again.

85
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,136
Ever push cattle?

86
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,514
Of course not.

87
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,684
Well, I'll tell you,
sometimes they get spooked.

88
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:11,313
So spooked, the slightest
little thing'll start a stampede.

89
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:15,400
And when they get that way...

90
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,028
well, a man has to ride
a mile just to spit.

91
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:21,823
- You talk too much.
- Yeah, I know.

92
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:23,825
My ma used to say...

93
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,204
when they were passing out
tongues, I was the first in line.

94
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,043
- Time for your bath, darling...
- What's that?

95
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,212
Find us a tree.

96
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,258
- Nothing. Just the usual.
- No, what's going on?

97
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,103
They're just hanging some Reb.

98
00:12:52,562 --> 00:12:53,897
Get off of me.

99
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,488
I gotta go.

100
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:04,533
Aren't you gonna take a bath?

101
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:42,529
What about it, Reb? Any last words?

102
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:44,239
Go to hell.

103
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,326
Excuse me...

104
00:13:50,954 --> 00:13:53,915
I seem to have caught you
in the middle of something.

105
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:56,543
We just having a little fun.

106
00:13:56,793 --> 00:13:59,796
I mean, up to now, it's just
been swatting mosquitoes.

107
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,757
Now we gonna hang us a Reb.

108
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:05,594
- Get him down.
- What for?

109
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:08,763
- You a Yankee, ain't you?
- That's right.

110
00:14:09,055 --> 00:14:11,641
Well, this man's a Reb. A damned Reb.

111
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:13,935
Why you bothering?

112
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:18,523
Usually wouldn't, except this
one happens to be my brother.

113
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,025
Get him down.

114
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:33,914
Put your guns down by that tree. Now!

115
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,461
Now, get him down and cut him loose.

116
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,717
Come on, fellas, it's hot. Just
how many holes you want to dig?

117
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,554
Down on your bellies.

118
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,863
Seems to remind you
of something, don't it?

119
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,282
Yeah, only it was
the other way around.

120
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,701
- Old Man Childer's barn?
- Yeah.

121
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,622
I recall his daughter was there, too.
And her brothers coming after you.

122
00:15:15,705 --> 00:15:18,500
Yeah. I had a hell of a
time pulling my boots on.

123
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:22,045
It wasn't just your
boots, little brother.

124
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:27,550
- What're you doing here?
- Just passing through.

125
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:31,638
- You?
- Doesn't matter anymore.

126
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,809
It's good to see you,
Dal. Especially alive.

127
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,854
Good to see you, too, Mac.

128
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,193
Let's go home.

129
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,881
You know, Mac...

130
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:10,385
half a day's ride, we'll be home.

131
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:14,431
- Does Kate know you're coming?
- Nobody knows I'm coming.

132
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,809
Sure did miss her.

133
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:21,146
I got a feeling it was
more than home cooking.

134
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:03,813
- Where is everybody?
- Pa?

135
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,609
Mama?

136
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,353
Don't neither one of you move.

137
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:46,648
Pa?

138
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:48,983
Mac, is that you?

139
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,028
Well, of course it's me.

140
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:02,205
Well, it's a good thing you yelled
out, boy. I was all set to shoot.

141
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:11,005
Who's that with you, boy?

142
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,550
It's me, Pa. Dal.

143
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,719
By God, it is.

144
00:18:18,221 --> 00:18:20,390
Ma, you better come out here.

145
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,318
Take a good look,
Mother. They got it wrong.

146
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:35,738
- Damn, I knew they did.
- Quit your swearing, Luke.

147
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:38,783
Dal, is it you?

148
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:41,703
How you doing, Mama?

149
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:44,914
There's only one man in
the world with that voice.

150
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:48,584
Underneath that
grizzle, it's his face.

151
00:18:50,044 --> 00:18:52,338
The army told us you were dead.

152
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:54,465
Son.

153
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,887
Mac, give me a hug.

154
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:08,438
Hey, where are the girls?

155
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:14,485
What happened, Ma?

156
00:19:14,652 --> 00:19:16,988
Let me get a jug, and I'll tell you.

157
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,489
Hold this.

158
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:27,165
They were in this place before
anybody knew it. Tore it apart.

159
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:29,292
When they pulled out...

160
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:32,420
they took Sissy and Heather with them.

161
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:36,299
Jesse tried fighting them off,
but they just hit too fast.

162
00:19:36,424 --> 00:19:38,134
You mean Jesse was here?

163
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:39,552
Two months ago.

164
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:42,972
He got wounded somewhere in
Tennessee, and they sent him home.

165
00:19:43,848 --> 00:19:45,808
Looks like you put up a fight.

166
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:50,188
Oh, I managed to get off a couple of
shots, but there was just too many of them.

167
00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:52,190
Comanches have got nothing on them.

168
00:19:52,315 --> 00:19:56,486
They took all the livestock and just about
every speck of food we had in the place.

169
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:59,363
You keep saying "they," Pa.
Who're you talking about?

170
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:03,034
Soldiers. Like him. Rebs.

171
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:07,997
You got any idea where they went?

172
00:20:08,331 --> 00:20:10,666
South is all anybody seems to know.

173
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,795
Mama? You all right?

174
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:15,963
She ain't slept since it happened.

175
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:18,549
How can I sleep when
they stole my children?

176
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:20,843
What about the Connery place?

177
00:20:21,344 --> 00:20:22,887
Kate all right?

178
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:26,557
Kate was here. Came for supper.

179
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,351
You mean she's with them?

180
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:31,771
You know Kate, she'd
give them a fight.

181
00:20:31,854 --> 00:20:34,482
What about the law?
What've they been doing?

182
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:37,443
Not much they could do
without getting folks killed.

183
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:41,822
And if it's Gillette you're talking
about, he wasn't even around.

184
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:44,158
Where the hell's he
been the last few days?

185
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:46,827
I figure I'll go into
town and ask him that.

186
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,540
Go get my children and
you bring them back.

187
00:20:50,623 --> 00:20:52,792
Don't worry, Mama, we'll find them.

188
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:04,929
Mac, I don't want you having
a run-in with Miles Gillette.

189
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:07,265
You might kill him.

190
00:21:08,641 --> 00:21:10,643
Why don't you stay
here with the folks.

191
00:21:10,726 --> 00:21:13,980
I'm gonna ride over to the
Sparks place and talk to Shorty.

192
00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:16,941
Yeah, I guess you're right.

193
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:21,654
Somebody ought to stay with Ma and
Pa. You just find out who did it, Dal.

194
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:24,240
Be ready to ride.

195
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:55,229
Dal? I'll be doggone.

196
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:58,691
Everybody had you dead and
buried for dang near a year.

197
00:21:59,108 --> 00:22:01,569
Good to see you're still kicking.

198
00:22:02,194 --> 00:22:03,654
How are you, Miles?

199
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:07,199
You got any idea who
hit our folks' place?

200
00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:11,078
All we know is a band of renegades
swept through about a week ago.

201
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:14,582
Hit about a half a dozen places in
the county, then just disappeared.

202
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:16,042
How many of them?

203
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,294
About a dozen of them,
from what I heard.

204
00:22:18,335 --> 00:22:20,921
Armed to the teeth. Had
some wagons with them.

205
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:24,675
Some of them full of grain,
others were carrying prisoners.

206
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:27,428
Where were you when all
of this was going on?

207
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:30,890
I was down in Converse, running
down a prisoner of my own.

208
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:33,601
That's, kind of, out of
your territory, isn't it?

209
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:37,104
Yep, a ways. But I wanted
to see this man locked up.

210
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:40,649
Happens he was a kin of
yours, your Uncle Jack.

211
00:22:41,984 --> 00:22:44,320
Dal, even if I'd been here when
the renegades come through...

212
00:22:44,403 --> 00:22:46,197
there's nothing I could
have done about it.

213
00:22:46,238 --> 00:22:49,366
- You could've gone after them.
- They didn't leave much choice.

214
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,536
Said anyone tried following,
they'd find nothing but bodies.

215
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,623
- Dal?
- Hello, Frank.

216
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,878
Sorry you had to come back
to something like this.

217
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,088
Appears they hit your place, too.

218
00:23:04,715 --> 00:23:07,676
Happens I was out at
your folks', with Kate.

219
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:12,014
We were engaged, Dal.
Gonna get married.

220
00:23:12,097 --> 00:23:14,308
We all thought you were dead.

221
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:20,064
- Pa said they were headed south.
- Yeah, pulled out about four days ago.

222
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,400
I gotta feeling you're
going after them.

223
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:26,570
Mac's out at the place
now. He'll ride with me.

224
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:45,589
Sharp's. Take them.

225
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:48,634
Knock the stripes off
a skunk from 500 yard.

226
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:50,261
Thanks, Miles.

227
00:24:11,156 --> 00:24:13,951
- I'm sorry.
- She's a hell of a woman.

228
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:28,358
- I want to go home.
- I know, Heather. We all do.

229
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:33,405
Why hasn't someone come to help
us, Kate? Someone has to come.

230
00:25:33,572 --> 00:25:36,533
We can't count on that.
We've got to do it ourselves.

231
00:25:38,494 --> 00:25:39,536
How?

232
00:25:40,954 --> 00:25:42,873
I'm gonna talk to Jesse.

233
00:25:43,457 --> 00:25:46,710
- Do you think they'll let you?
- Only one way to find out.

234
00:25:47,336 --> 00:25:48,921
Watch yourself, Kate.

235
00:25:59,431 --> 00:26:00,682
Hold it.

236
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,453
- How're the girls holding up?
- They want to go home.

237
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,374
Kate, if they take us all to
Mexico, we don't have a chance.

238
00:26:32,047 --> 00:26:33,757
Maybe this'll help.

239
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:44,017
- Where'd you get that?
- From Dal, when we were kids.

240
00:26:48,438 --> 00:26:52,067
I keep thinking I'm
gonna look up someday...

241
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:54,319
and there he is.

242
00:26:54,403 --> 00:26:57,489
- He's dead, Jesse.
- I don't believe that.

243
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:00,576
He's too ornery.

244
00:27:06,915 --> 00:27:10,294
- I might need some help.
- I'll be waiting for your move.

245
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:13,672
Miss Connery?

246
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,093
Get back to the women.

247
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,315
And as for you...

248
00:27:31,565 --> 00:27:35,235
whatever it is you're hatching,
forget it, or end up dead.

249
00:27:46,455 --> 00:27:48,915
Horses, cattle...

250
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:52,294
three or four wagons, all
of them carrying a real load.

251
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:54,004
A regular caravan.

252
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:56,715
They're heading for the coast.

253
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,676
Figured they'd head straight
for Mexico. I don't get it.

254
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:03,847
- Maybe they're going for a swim.
- They can swim in the Rio Grande.

255
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:08,120
No matter what happens, I want
you to stay out of the way.

256
00:29:08,203 --> 00:29:11,331
- What are you up to?
- Just do as I say.

257
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,429
Miss Connery.

258
00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:29,307
Please, sit down.

259
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:35,856
I was wondering when we'd
have a little time to visit.

260
00:29:42,028 --> 00:29:43,613
Why are you doing this?

261
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:46,116
I have my reasons.

262
00:29:46,366 --> 00:29:49,244
No reason could be
worth what you're doing.

263
00:29:50,328 --> 00:29:52,914
I'm talking about the
South, Miss Connery...

264
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:55,458
and a way of life
that was taken from us.

265
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:58,336
What makes you think
you can get it back?

266
00:29:59,963 --> 00:30:01,464
Miss Connery...

267
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:04,175
the rebel yell was first
heard at Manassas...

268
00:30:04,593 --> 00:30:08,305
and at 100 battles since then,
from Richmond to Gettysburg.

269
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:12,809
The rebel yell is hard to describe.

270
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:16,605
It's a mixture of fear
and anger and exaltation...

271
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:19,900
but it inspires men, even from defeat.

272
00:30:21,234 --> 00:30:25,322
These damn Yankees think they've heard
the last of it, but they haven't...

273
00:30:25,405 --> 00:30:28,158
and I'm gonna get it
back any way I can.

274
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:31,411
These people have nothing
to do with any of that.

275
00:30:34,122 --> 00:30:37,000
I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.

276
00:31:05,528 --> 00:31:06,863
Hey, you...

277
00:31:08,865 --> 00:31:12,952
these ropes are starting my wrists to
bleed. How about making them looser?

278
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:25,465
Somebody's escaping.

279
00:31:27,717 --> 00:31:29,219
Hold your fire.

280
00:31:31,221 --> 00:31:33,056
I don't want him dead.

281
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:43,233
I'll get him.

282
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:55,578
I said, no shooting.

283
00:32:07,132 --> 00:32:08,925
- Major!
- Kill him.

284
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:22,438
That's the end of him.

285
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,152
Too bad, he would've brought
a good price in Mexico.

286
00:32:43,835 --> 00:32:46,921
Great idea of yours,
taking this canyon.

287
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:49,132
It's hot enough to pop corn.

288
00:32:49,674 --> 00:32:51,301
Get a leg broke.

289
00:32:53,052 --> 00:32:57,473
Everything seems to have a bite to it,
and I'm smelling like an old sheepherder.

290
00:32:58,433 --> 00:33:00,977
Mac, they got a four-day jump on us.

291
00:33:01,436 --> 00:33:04,522
This canyon's the shortest
way I know to the coast.

292
00:33:05,189 --> 00:33:06,274
Yeah.

293
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:10,111
Come on, big brother.

294
00:33:10,528 --> 00:33:14,282
What's got your back up? You ain't
said much the last couple of hours.

295
00:33:14,365 --> 00:33:15,700
It's Kate.

296
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:19,037
I never figured that woman to run off.

297
00:33:19,203 --> 00:33:21,956
Well, Dal, she thought you were dead.

298
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,752
Well, she might have waited to
find out. I mean, Frank King!

299
00:33:26,836 --> 00:33:31,215
Nice enough fella. Owns a big
ranch, runs a lot of cattle.

300
00:33:33,384 --> 00:33:36,220
Always said there never
could be no other man.

301
00:33:36,304 --> 00:33:40,350
Hell, even if I was dead, she
didn't give me a chance to get cold.

302
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:42,936
You're right. Forget her.

303
00:33:43,436 --> 00:33:45,355
What do you mean, forget her?

304
00:33:45,438 --> 00:33:48,232
She might have had
her reasons, you know.

305
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:25,728
I'm sorry about your friend.

306
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,607
Go on.

307
00:34:31,943 --> 00:34:35,196
You don't have to end up
like the others, Miss Connery.

308
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:38,199
I would like to take
you back south with me.

309
00:34:38,616 --> 00:34:42,453
I can offer you a more
genteel way of life.

310
00:34:43,287 --> 00:34:45,665
You go back there,
and they'll shoot you.

311
00:34:45,748 --> 00:34:48,709
You're not a soldier
anymore, you're an outlaw.

312
00:34:48,793 --> 00:34:52,797
I'm still Major Cooper
Ashbury, and they'll follow me.

313
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:55,800
What about the Traven girls?

314
00:34:56,008 --> 00:35:00,304
They'll end up in
Chihuahua eventually.

315
00:35:01,889 --> 00:35:06,144
What about you, Miss Connery?
Does my proposal interest you?

316
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:09,188
Nothing about you interests me, Major.

317
00:35:10,189 --> 00:35:12,483
I'd rather end up in Chihuahua.

318
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:57,195
She's coming in, Major.

319
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:10,374
Bring down the trade goods and
all the people now onto the beach.

320
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:11,542
Yes, sir.

321
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:13,544
Attention, men!

322
00:36:14,086 --> 00:36:17,798
Bring down the trade goods and
the people to the beach now!

323
00:36:30,895 --> 00:36:32,313
You heard the Lieutenant!

324
00:36:32,396 --> 00:36:34,899
Don't just stand there gaping, move!

325
00:36:36,734 --> 00:36:38,611
Pull them wagons round.

326
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:47,244
Soldier, get these women
lined up with the others.

327
00:36:50,247 --> 00:36:51,999
Don't you touch her.

328
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:56,379
Hell in petticoats.
Don't touch them, Hardy.

329
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:02,343
Get in there.

330
00:37:02,426 --> 00:37:04,553
Come on, let's get in there.

331
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,442
Take it right up to shore.

332
00:37:27,993 --> 00:37:29,537
Careful, senor.

333
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:32,832
Colonel Hammond, I'm Major Ashbury.

334
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:37,461
Even down here, Major, we're
aware that the war is over.

335
00:37:37,545 --> 00:37:41,674
It's not for me, or for my
men. That's why I contacted you.

336
00:37:42,174 --> 00:37:45,094
We're in the market
for arms and ammunition.

337
00:37:45,594 --> 00:37:48,347
We plan to go back
and kill the Yankees.

338
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:52,518
Well, it's a relief to see that
you don't hold a grudge, Major.

339
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:02,486
- I'd like to see the guns.
- Surely.

340
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:04,280
Rifle.

341
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,658
- Lieutenant.
- Sir?

342
00:38:12,538 --> 00:38:15,040
I'll need 200 more, and ammunition.

343
00:38:15,124 --> 00:38:17,334
That is not a problem, Major.

344
00:38:17,418 --> 00:38:19,587
I'd like to see the
rest of the guns now.

345
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:23,257
- You can't. They're not here.
- Then where are they?

346
00:38:23,674 --> 00:38:25,801
Two days sailing from here.

347
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:28,637
I've run guns for too long, Major.

348
00:38:28,721 --> 00:38:32,516
I make it a practice to see the
other man's merchandise first.

349
00:38:32,975 --> 00:38:34,560
Then take a look.

350
00:38:34,643 --> 00:38:37,021
I guarantee these women
will bring a good price.

351
00:38:37,104 --> 00:38:40,691
The men I took are strong, they're
ideal for working in the silver mines.

352
00:38:40,774 --> 00:38:44,236
- Plus a herd of cattle and horses.
- That's the grain?

353
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:47,156
Most of it. We have close to a ton.

354
00:38:48,574 --> 00:38:51,327
I understand Maximilian
needs it to feed his troops...

355
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,579
and you do business with Maximilian.

356
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:56,207
I do business with the highest bidder.

357
00:38:58,417 --> 00:38:59,877
She won't do.

358
00:39:00,085 --> 00:39:02,004
She's strong. She's a hard worker.

359
00:39:02,087 --> 00:39:06,050
So is a mule, but it's not what
they're interested in down there.

360
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:09,053
You see, this is what
they're interested in.

361
00:39:10,638 --> 00:39:12,556
Young and fresh.

362
00:39:16,852 --> 00:39:18,354
And spirited.

363
00:39:19,188 --> 00:39:21,941
- What's your price?
- They're not for sale.

364
00:39:22,149 --> 00:39:24,443
She speak for you, Major?

365
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,528
They are special.

366
00:39:26,612 --> 00:39:28,113
Well, I agree.

367
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,992
Blonde hair is rare south of
the border, brings a good price.

368
00:39:32,034 --> 00:39:34,286
And red hair's even more rare.

369
00:39:34,745 --> 00:39:36,914
I'll give you $1,000 for her.

370
00:39:37,373 --> 00:39:39,792
Well, what'll it be, Miss Connery?

371
00:39:40,084 --> 00:39:42,378
I meant what I said last night.

372
00:39:44,797 --> 00:39:47,424
Throw in a dozen
rifles, and she's yours.

373
00:39:47,508 --> 00:39:49,718
- Done.
- Too bad.

374
00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:07,653
- Get his boots.
- Yeah.

375
00:40:29,675 --> 00:40:30,759
Dal.

376
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:34,513
- Mac?
- He still remembers us.

377
00:40:37,015 --> 00:40:38,517
Dal, it is you.

378
00:40:39,727 --> 00:40:43,313
- They said you were...
- I know, I'm getting tired of hearing that.

379
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:54,867
Yeah, they were Rebs, all
right. Still fighting the war.

380
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,578
Man leading them
calls himself Ashbury.

381
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:01,039
- Cooper Ashbury? A Major?
- That's him.

382
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:05,878
The men he's riding with would follow
him straight into hell if he called it.

383
00:41:05,961 --> 00:41:07,629
I was afraid of that.

384
00:41:07,671 --> 00:41:10,632
You're right about them following
him into hell, they would.

385
00:41:10,716 --> 00:41:14,803
- I rode with him once myself.
- Why did they take so many hostages?

386
00:41:14,887 --> 00:41:18,056
Figured we'd be worth
something to slave traders.

387
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,058
Comancheros.

388
00:41:21,393 --> 00:41:24,646
Sell the men for slave
labour in the silver mines...

389
00:41:25,063 --> 00:41:27,566
take the women down to
Chihuahua and sell them for...

390
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:29,568
Yeah, we get the picture.

391
00:41:31,236 --> 00:41:33,655
The folks, how they doing anyway?

392
00:41:35,741 --> 00:41:38,076
Sitting home alone, waiting.

393
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,747
- Well, at least they're together.
- Yup.

394
00:41:42,581 --> 00:41:45,083
They always done just fine together.

395
00:41:48,128 --> 00:41:51,798
- How're the girls doing? They all right?
- Heather's scared.

396
00:41:53,884 --> 00:41:58,096
Sissy's looking out for her, and
Kate's looking out for both of them.

397
00:41:59,264 --> 00:42:02,643
Hear you got yourself wounded
somewhere in Tennessee.

398
00:42:04,102 --> 00:42:05,354
Shoulder.

399
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,609
But it's all right now.

400
00:42:11,944 --> 00:42:14,321
Did Ma tell you what
colour I was wearing?

401
00:42:14,988 --> 00:42:17,199
Blue, grey, it doesn't matter.

402
00:42:17,616 --> 00:42:20,953
A man fights for what he believes
in. Just be glad it's over.

403
00:42:21,078 --> 00:42:22,537
Amen to that.

404
00:42:31,129 --> 00:42:32,589
Can you ride?

405
00:42:36,134 --> 00:42:37,719
Yeah, I can ride.

406
00:42:41,848 --> 00:42:43,684
Going in the morning.

407
00:43:02,244 --> 00:43:04,329
When do we go for the guns?

408
00:43:04,705 --> 00:43:05,998
The first tide.

409
00:43:06,081 --> 00:43:09,167
But there'll only be yourself
and two men allowed along.

410
00:43:09,292 --> 00:43:12,504
There's the grain and the
prisoners. No room for everyone.

411
00:43:16,049 --> 00:43:17,968
What about the horses and the cattle?

412
00:43:18,093 --> 00:43:22,556
My men will drive them down when
we come back, in four or five days.

413
00:43:23,181 --> 00:43:25,017
You have a deal, Major.

414
00:43:25,684 --> 00:43:27,394
You can trust me.

415
00:43:37,362 --> 00:43:40,323
I was wondering if you
would care to join me.

416
00:43:40,782 --> 00:43:43,744
The pheasant in this part of
the country is extraordinary.

417
00:43:43,785 --> 00:43:45,829
Cooked with wine and sage.

418
00:43:47,205 --> 00:43:48,957
You must be starved.

419
00:43:51,001 --> 00:43:52,085
Well?

420
00:44:08,477 --> 00:44:11,897
If you're thinking of using
that knife on me, don't.

421
00:44:12,481 --> 00:44:15,776
- And if I did?
- That man out there would shoot you.

422
00:44:16,902 --> 00:44:21,114
Thereby making you a somewhat
less attractive dinner partner.

423
00:44:23,366 --> 00:44:24,618
Allow me.

424
00:44:28,038 --> 00:44:29,915
What happens to us now?

425
00:44:29,998 --> 00:44:32,000
- Chihuahua?
- No.

426
00:44:32,834 --> 00:44:35,879
Not you. You're much
too good for that.

427
00:44:37,172 --> 00:44:41,259
Why not Mexico City,
St. Louis, New Orleans?

428
00:44:44,262 --> 00:44:47,307
I'm really tempted to
take you along with me...

429
00:44:47,933 --> 00:44:50,685
but I'm just afraid that
I'd awaken some morning...

430
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:53,730
and find you'd made a
necklace with my teeth.

431
00:44:55,607 --> 00:44:59,361
- No, you'll stay here for now.
- What about the girls?

432
00:44:59,444 --> 00:45:03,156
- They're coming with me.
- I'd rather go with them.

433
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,449
I'm sorry.

434
00:45:04,491 --> 00:45:08,662
I'll be back in a while, and then
we'll decide what to do with you.

435
00:45:28,807 --> 00:45:31,142
Put your backs into it, boys!

436
00:46:21,943 --> 00:46:25,363
Oh, God. Kate's there,
but they took the girls.

437
00:48:11,636 --> 00:48:14,138
Stampede!

438
00:48:59,684 --> 00:49:03,604
- You cut that kind of close, didn't you?
- I got sand in my eye.

439
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:23,624
I should have known you'd come.

440
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:25,752
Yeah, you should've.

441
00:49:34,302 --> 00:49:36,512
I told you he was too ornery.

442
00:49:36,888 --> 00:49:38,056
Jesse!

443
00:49:41,017 --> 00:49:43,561
Oh, God, we thought they'd killed you.

444
00:49:43,644 --> 00:49:47,231
If you ain't learnt by now,
the Travens are a hard kill.

445
00:49:48,066 --> 00:49:50,902
I got something here
that belongs to you.

446
00:49:52,445 --> 00:49:54,072
Thank you, Kate.

447
00:49:57,533 --> 00:49:59,952
- Hello, Mac.
- Hello, Kate.

448
00:50:04,749 --> 00:50:08,002
Hey, how do you like what
I picked up on the trail?

449
00:50:08,669 --> 00:50:10,755
What about Heather and Sissy?

450
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:12,965
They sailed this morning for Mexico.

451
00:50:13,049 --> 00:50:16,594
- Why didn't they take you along?
- They thought I'd be trouble.

452
00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:20,056
I can appreciate that.

453
00:50:20,765 --> 00:50:23,935
- What about Ashbury?
- He sailed with them.

454
00:50:25,603 --> 00:50:27,855
It's a hard ride between
here and Chihuahua.

455
00:50:27,939 --> 00:50:30,024
And them travelling by ship.

456
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:32,443
I don't know nothing about Mexico.

457
00:50:32,527 --> 00:50:33,569
Dal?

458
00:50:33,861 --> 00:50:35,113
Not much.

459
00:50:35,947 --> 00:50:37,115
Jesse?

460
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:41,327
I know someone who does.

461
00:50:42,745 --> 00:50:44,121
Jack Traven.

462
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:50,336
You are talking about
Uncle "Black Jack" Traven?

463
00:50:50,419 --> 00:50:51,671
Yes, sir.

464
00:50:54,298 --> 00:50:58,427
Well, big brother, you know there are
some people who call him "scoundrel."

465
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,889
Some might even call him "outlaw."

466
00:51:03,307 --> 00:51:07,186
And we all know he's a rogue. Besides,
we don't know where to find him.

467
00:51:07,562 --> 00:51:09,355
Converse County Jail.

468
00:51:13,484 --> 00:51:15,152
What are we waiting for?

469
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:49,895
Never seen old Uncle
Jack raise a sweat before.

470
00:52:06,412 --> 00:52:10,207
Well, good to see you boys made
it through the war all right.

471
00:52:13,711 --> 00:52:18,049
Well, quit gawking. It's humiliating
enough without you laughing on it.

472
00:52:18,215 --> 00:52:21,302
Come on, Uncle Jack,
you've been in jail before.

473
00:52:21,427 --> 00:52:25,181
I don't care about that. It's
the working I'm talking about.

474
00:52:25,348 --> 00:52:29,060
A lot of men have seen me raise
a lot of hell in my time...

475
00:52:29,143 --> 00:52:32,730
but not one man alive has
ever seen me raise a blister.

476
00:52:32,813 --> 00:52:35,024
Well, don't fret about it, Jack.

477
00:52:35,107 --> 00:52:38,778
We're not gonna tell nobody.
What did they lock you up for?

478
00:52:39,987 --> 00:52:42,907
They're just trying to make
something out of nothing.

479
00:52:43,324 --> 00:52:47,578
I met this gal over in Big Springs,
and it turned out she was married.

480
00:52:47,953 --> 00:52:49,872
You're in here 'cause of that?

481
00:52:50,998 --> 00:52:54,960
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that, but...

482
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:58,547
How'd you boys know where to find me?

483
00:52:58,631 --> 00:53:00,132
Miles Gillette.

484
00:53:00,716 --> 00:53:02,468
Miles Gillette, huh?

485
00:53:04,136 --> 00:53:07,973
Mac, I sure hope you're still
figuring on running against him.

486
00:53:08,682 --> 00:53:13,270
I'll swear that man's been after my
hide for 30 years, and he won't let up.

487
00:53:13,687 --> 00:53:15,856
What did you ever do to him?

488
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:17,817
Nothing serious.

489
00:53:18,067 --> 00:53:21,403
I mean, a man can't even bend
the law a little bit anymore.

490
00:53:21,487 --> 00:53:25,116
Now, last time you were in
jail, it was over a woman, too.

491
00:53:25,241 --> 00:53:27,159
Judge's wife, I recall.

492
00:53:28,828 --> 00:53:30,746
And there was shooting.

493
00:53:31,163 --> 00:53:32,623
Self defence.

494
00:53:33,082 --> 00:53:35,459
Ain't you getting a
little old for that?

495
00:53:36,168 --> 00:53:39,296
- You mean gunplay?
- No, I mean the other.

496
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,883
When I get too old for that,
they'll be shoveling dirt in my face.

497
00:53:42,967 --> 00:53:45,678
How about this last
woman? Any shooting?

498
00:53:47,179 --> 00:53:49,181
No serious shooting.

499
00:53:53,435 --> 00:53:56,856
- We just dropped by to say hello.
- Thanks.

500
00:53:57,356 --> 00:53:59,775
Mac, we need him.

501
00:53:59,859 --> 00:54:03,028
- You heard what he said.
- Yep, except we need him.

502
00:54:03,112 --> 00:54:04,780
Well, that's fine.

503
00:54:04,989 --> 00:54:08,409
Except, how we gonna get
him out? I mean, it's a jail.

504
00:54:09,285 --> 00:54:10,786
Got any ideas?

505
00:54:11,704 --> 00:54:12,788
Yeah.

506
00:54:22,506 --> 00:54:25,509
Come on, Uncle Jack, we
gotta get out of here.

507
00:54:29,388 --> 00:54:31,140
Come on, Uncle Jack.

508
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:35,519
Well, did you have to use
two sticks of dynamite?

509
00:55:00,669 --> 00:55:03,297
- Hello, Kate.
- Hello, Jack.

510
00:55:04,381 --> 00:55:06,800
- Brought your horse.
- Thank you.

511
00:55:06,884 --> 00:55:09,595
- Glad to see you're still alive.
- Well, thank you.

512
00:55:09,637 --> 00:55:12,514
Take a look at these wrinkles
and these here grey hairs.

513
00:55:12,598 --> 00:55:14,600
Every one of them earned.

514
00:55:18,187 --> 00:55:21,315
Well, I sure do appreciate
you boys busting me out.

515
00:55:21,398 --> 00:55:24,526
I hope nobody back
there got a good look.

516
00:55:25,653 --> 00:55:28,197
I gotta be loco. Blowing up a jail!

517
00:55:29,114 --> 00:55:31,450
By the way, where we bound?

518
00:55:32,034 --> 00:55:33,243
Mexico.

519
00:55:33,786 --> 00:55:36,664
You do know the country
down there, don't you?

520
00:55:36,705 --> 00:55:40,042
I know more about that country than
a jackrabbit knows about running.

521
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:43,212
Every trail, back trail, cantinas...

522
00:55:44,129 --> 00:55:45,547
bawdyhouses.

523
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:49,468
We're not exactly going
down there sightseeing, Jack.

524
00:55:49,551 --> 00:55:50,803
We ain't?

525
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:52,638
Then why?

526
00:55:52,721 --> 00:55:55,724
Mac, Dal, better get up here!

527
00:56:09,822 --> 00:56:11,407
Right out there.

528
00:56:16,078 --> 00:56:17,704
Who the hell are they?

529
00:56:17,788 --> 00:56:20,124
I'd say that's gotta be a posse.

530
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:22,501
Looks like they're in a hurry.

531
00:56:22,584 --> 00:56:25,421
Uncle Jack, have you been
telling us everything?

532
00:56:25,546 --> 00:56:26,797
What do you mean?

533
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,759
I mean, by the way they're
riding, you left out something.

534
00:56:31,176 --> 00:56:34,596
Yeah, it might be that
fella I shot over in Waco.

535
00:56:35,889 --> 00:56:39,268
- You mean you killed someone?
- No, it's worse.

536
00:56:40,227 --> 00:56:41,895
His father was the mayor.

537
00:56:41,979 --> 00:56:43,355
I don't want to hear anymore.

538
00:56:43,397 --> 00:56:46,191
If they catch up to us, my chances
of running for office are dead.

539
00:56:46,316 --> 00:56:47,985
You hear me? Dead!

540
00:56:49,111 --> 00:56:51,238
You could always start over.

541
00:57:25,188 --> 00:57:27,399
That's Miles Gillette leading them.

542
00:57:28,025 --> 00:57:29,526
What's he doing along?

543
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:31,695
Maybe he heard you're
fixing to run for sheriff.

544
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:34,406
Why is the Sheriff of Big
Springs chasing after you...

545
00:57:34,531 --> 00:57:36,450
for something you did in Waco?

546
00:57:36,533 --> 00:57:40,704
Well, Mac, you know how that old
turkey's had it in for me all these years.

547
00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:43,582
If you keep jawing, they're
gonna catch up to us.

548
00:57:43,665 --> 00:57:46,710
No, because in a few hours
we'll be at the Rio Grande.

549
00:57:46,752 --> 00:57:49,463
When we cross that,
we'll be in Mexico.

550
00:58:33,924 --> 00:58:35,425
It's your men?

551
00:58:36,134 --> 00:58:37,969
My welcoming committee.

552
00:58:38,095 --> 00:58:40,430
I don't see any sign of the rifles.

553
00:58:40,514 --> 00:58:43,767
We have a system here.
You see those wagons?

554
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:47,437
They're to transport the grain
and the prisoners to the train.

555
00:58:47,562 --> 00:58:48,647
Train?

556
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:50,941
The train that will
take us to Chihuahua.

557
00:58:50,982 --> 00:58:54,027
- Your rifles are on that train.
- How far?

558
00:58:55,195 --> 00:58:57,489
Half a day's journey from here.

559
00:59:07,249 --> 00:59:10,669
Hey, Carlos, what do you think
of this pretty blonde girl here?

560
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:56,882
Where is Jack?

561
00:59:57,215 --> 01:00:00,343
He was supposed to be keeping
watch, but he disappeared.

562
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,722
- Where's Mac?
- Looking for Uncle Jack.

563
01:00:23,742 --> 01:00:26,745
- Here, I brought you a little drink.
- Where you been?

564
01:00:26,786 --> 01:00:30,790
There's a village back there, and you know
they got some girls there that would just...

565
01:00:30,832 --> 01:00:33,501
That posse's in sight. Best get going.

566
01:00:34,127 --> 01:00:37,339
You still haven't told us why
that posse isn't letting up.

567
01:00:37,464 --> 01:00:40,008
- Well, it must be that other thing.
- What thing?

568
01:00:40,008 --> 01:00:43,220
Well, it wasn't my fault. I was
just drinking a lot of whiskey and...

569
01:00:43,345 --> 01:00:46,514
Whiskey gets the blame for a lot
of things it didn't do. Come on.

570
01:00:46,556 --> 01:00:48,558
Hold on to that tequila.

571
01:01:48,326 --> 01:01:49,994
Unload everything.

572
01:01:50,912 --> 01:01:53,164
Put them all in the stockade!

573
01:01:53,581 --> 01:01:55,500
And I mean all of them.

574
01:01:59,003 --> 01:02:00,338
No!

575
01:02:01,005 --> 01:02:03,633
All right, get down. Move!

576
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:46,468
- No sign of them.
- Good.

577
01:02:47,093 --> 01:02:50,054
I best get back up
there and keep a lookout.

578
01:02:52,182 --> 01:02:55,059
Good thing they let
up. Horses need a rest.

579
01:02:55,143 --> 01:02:58,021
Yeah, could be they're
doing the same thing.

580
01:03:25,965 --> 01:03:28,885
- How you making out?
- I'm doing fine.

581
01:03:34,057 --> 01:03:35,516
Kind of warm.

582
01:03:38,478 --> 01:03:39,812
Hey, Kate.

583
01:03:42,941 --> 01:03:45,777
How did you manage to get
so friendly with Frank King?

584
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,320
What do you mean?

585
01:03:47,362 --> 01:03:50,615
The two of you're engaged. I'd
say that's getting pretty friendly.

586
01:03:50,698 --> 01:03:54,244
I heard you were killed.
What was I supposed to do?

587
01:03:54,285 --> 01:03:56,496
You always said you'd wait for me.

588
01:03:56,579 --> 01:04:00,166
Wait? I waited for
you most of my life.

589
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:03,878
- Like I said, I heard you were dead.
- Well, I ain't dead.

590
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,047
I never got word otherwise.

591
01:04:07,632 --> 01:04:09,801
Same as when you left, not a word.

592
01:04:09,926 --> 01:04:11,928
There was a war going on.

593
01:04:12,303 --> 01:04:14,013
You know, sometimes
a man's gotta do...

594
01:04:14,097 --> 01:04:16,265
What he has to do. Well,
sometimes a woman does, too...

595
01:04:16,307 --> 01:04:19,143
and I'm a woman, Dal
Traven, not a martyr.

596
01:04:19,811 --> 01:04:22,981
I just thought you always
knew I'd be coming back.

597
01:04:24,816 --> 01:04:26,901
How was I supposed to know?

598
01:04:26,985 --> 01:04:29,320
I thought that's the
way it was meant to be.

599
01:04:29,404 --> 01:04:30,780
You thought?

600
01:04:31,739 --> 01:04:33,825
Why didn't you ever ask me?

601
01:04:35,576 --> 01:04:38,329
Ask you? Ask you what?

602
01:04:39,122 --> 01:04:42,417
Why didn't you ever ask me
what Frank King asked me?

603
01:04:53,803 --> 01:04:58,224
Hey, Dal, while you're down there
trying to figure out the female race...

604
01:04:58,349 --> 01:05:00,560
you might as well take a bath.

605
01:05:08,568 --> 01:05:10,570
Those two gotta be loco.

606
01:05:10,653 --> 01:05:12,905
I think they call that
love, little brother.

607
01:05:12,947 --> 01:05:15,032
Amounts to the same thing, don't it?

608
01:05:15,116 --> 01:05:16,909
How's your love life?

609
01:05:17,994 --> 01:05:19,245
Not me.

610
01:05:19,787 --> 01:05:23,583
Since I've been home, I spend my time
with the folks helping with the ranch.

611
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:25,710
What about your schooling?

612
01:05:26,335 --> 01:05:29,547
I figured I'd pick that
up again when we get back.

613
01:05:31,841 --> 01:05:33,885
Well, that's good to hear.

614
01:05:34,594 --> 01:05:36,721
We Travens got a lot of faults...

615
01:05:36,804 --> 01:05:39,307
but being ignorant ain't one of them.

616
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:42,643
Especially having a big brother
aiming to run for governor.

617
01:05:43,728 --> 01:05:46,481
No. That just sounds
good to the ladies.

618
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,487
You sure did leave an
awful big footprint, Mac.

619
01:05:53,321 --> 01:05:54,572
Listen...

620
01:05:55,531 --> 01:05:59,535
you just be yourself, Jesse. So
far, I'd say you're doing just fine.

621
01:06:03,414 --> 01:06:07,376
I just realised Holiday Hammond's
hangout's over that next ridge.

622
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:10,421
I know those boys up
there, and I can ride in.

623
01:06:10,963 --> 01:06:12,673
But they'll probably shoot you.

624
01:06:12,757 --> 01:06:14,634
You mean, there's nobody
else they'd let pass...

625
01:06:14,717 --> 01:06:17,261
through there besides
thieves and killers?

626
01:06:17,929 --> 01:06:19,430
Oh, no offence.

627
01:06:19,597 --> 01:06:22,391
Do you mind telling me how you're
gonna get the rest of us in there...

628
01:06:22,517 --> 01:06:25,436
without us ending up
in a funeral procession?

629
01:06:25,895 --> 01:06:28,147
Well, there's a mission
over here a little ways.

630
01:06:28,231 --> 01:06:31,567
I figured I'd ride over there
and say a prayer for you boys.

631
01:06:36,155 --> 01:06:37,657
What'd he say?

632
01:06:38,991 --> 01:06:41,244
Said he was gonna take up praying.

633
01:06:41,327 --> 01:06:43,120
You best go with him.

634
01:07:13,526 --> 01:07:14,652
Amen.

635
01:07:14,735 --> 01:07:16,362
Hey, where'd you get that?

636
01:07:16,445 --> 01:07:17,905
I borrowed them.

637
01:07:17,989 --> 01:07:19,240
You mean stole.

638
01:07:19,323 --> 01:07:21,617
They don't sell them, you know.

639
01:07:35,506 --> 01:07:37,508
You gonna borrow him, too?

640
01:07:38,134 --> 01:07:40,261
Here, you best take these...

641
01:07:40,845 --> 01:07:43,514
and we best quit jawing
and get out of here.

642
01:08:04,368 --> 01:08:08,039
Colonel, I would like
to see those guns now.

643
01:08:08,539 --> 01:08:11,542
Why, what's your hurry?
Enjoy the festivities.

644
01:08:12,877 --> 01:08:15,087
I have kept my end of the bargain.

645
01:08:15,171 --> 01:08:16,589
Manana, manana.

646
01:08:16,672 --> 01:08:19,383
Now! I want to see them now!

647
01:08:22,094 --> 01:08:23,846
The Major said now.

648
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:26,724
- Right now?
- Right now.

649
01:08:35,524 --> 01:08:38,903
You have been double-dealing
from the start, Colonel.

650
01:08:39,153 --> 01:08:43,073
That's right, Major. But, you
see, that's the risks you take...

651
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,660
when you deal with the
likes of me. Lock him up.

652
01:09:11,268 --> 01:09:13,354
What the hell's going on here?

653
01:09:13,437 --> 01:09:17,441
Kate's going in there and lend a
little comfort to the prisoners.

654
01:09:17,608 --> 01:09:18,943
Prisoners?

655
01:09:19,527 --> 01:09:21,737
You mean you want to
send her in there alone?

656
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:24,031
Well, it's gonna take at
least three of us, Dal.

657
01:09:24,114 --> 01:09:26,784
That's the only way I
know how to get us in.

658
01:09:26,867 --> 01:09:28,619
Why does it have to be Kate?

659
01:09:28,702 --> 01:09:31,789
Well, you'd look pretty
foolish in this getup.

660
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:38,629
Dal, don't forget Ashbury's in there.
Now, he knows you and he knows Jesse.

661
01:09:38,712 --> 01:09:40,798
Now I figure Uncle Jack
knows what he's saying.

662
01:09:40,881 --> 01:09:44,635
It's gonna take three of us inside.
That leaves me, Jack, and Kate.

663
01:09:45,135 --> 01:09:47,680
Well, Ashbury knows
Kate, too, you know.

664
01:09:47,763 --> 01:09:49,890
Not in that outfit he don't.

665
01:09:50,099 --> 01:09:52,017
I don't want her going in there.

666
01:09:52,101 --> 01:09:53,978
Well, what about what I want?

667
01:09:54,061 --> 01:09:56,981
I've been with this thing
a lot longer than you have.

668
01:09:57,064 --> 01:09:58,774
Heather and Sissy are in there.

669
01:09:58,857 --> 01:10:02,236
- How else are we gonna get them out?
- We'll find another way.

670
01:10:02,486 --> 01:10:05,948
Come on, Dal. What do you
say let's take a little ride?

671
01:10:23,424 --> 01:10:26,218
Jesse, why don't you go take
that Sharp's off my horse?

672
01:10:26,302 --> 01:10:29,888
The way this is going, you're
gonna need it more than me.

673
01:10:47,031 --> 01:10:49,158
Don't go hard on him, Kate.

674
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:53,662
I'm afraid he inherited
that ornery streak from Pa.

675
01:10:53,871 --> 01:10:56,707
I never seen your pa
ride hard on your ma.

676
01:10:57,374 --> 01:11:02,046
Oh, he tries. He tries, but
she just fights right back.

677
01:11:02,921 --> 01:11:04,548
Just like you do.

678
01:11:05,507 --> 01:11:07,968
They ended up having
a pretty good thing.

679
01:11:08,052 --> 01:11:09,511
That's all I want.

680
01:11:09,595 --> 01:11:12,639
Well, if you can tolerate
him, you'll have it.

681
01:11:14,016 --> 01:11:16,977
Kate, he needs you, you know that.

682
01:11:18,353 --> 01:11:22,232
You're right, he does need
me, but he doesn't know it.

683
01:11:22,483 --> 01:11:25,486
I think he does. Hell, you
know him as well as I do.

684
01:11:25,569 --> 01:11:26,862
He cares.

685
01:11:28,113 --> 01:11:30,616
I think he cares a lot, he just...

686
01:11:31,533 --> 01:11:33,702
He don't know how to say it.

687
01:11:33,786 --> 01:11:35,829
Well, isn't it about time he learnt?

688
01:11:35,913 --> 01:11:38,165
Well, it's not his way...

689
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:41,418
but I'll tell you something...

690
01:11:41,502 --> 01:11:44,963
I'd be willing to bet, you
stick with him, he'll learn.

691
01:11:47,674 --> 01:11:49,218
What about you?

692
01:11:52,429 --> 01:11:56,266
Kate, you sure you're gonna be
all right going in there alone?

693
01:11:57,142 --> 01:11:58,602
Don't worry, Mac.

694
01:11:58,685 --> 01:12:01,730
Even if they find me out,
they probably won't hurt me.

695
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,733
You didn't answer my
question. What about you?

696
01:12:04,817 --> 01:12:07,694
Going in there alone,
I mean, that's risky.

697
01:12:08,612 --> 01:12:11,031
- You always do that.
- What?

698
01:12:11,114 --> 01:12:14,034
Change the subject when
things get too close.

699
01:12:16,203 --> 01:12:19,122
You think you got me
figured out, don't you?

700
01:12:20,249 --> 01:12:23,210
Well, that's not gonna work, see,
because I'm not talking about me...

701
01:12:23,293 --> 01:12:25,170
I'm talking about Dal.

702
01:12:25,587 --> 01:12:28,423
Now, I think he's
acting the way he is...

703
01:12:28,507 --> 01:12:30,884
What is it with you Traven boys?

704
01:12:33,762 --> 01:12:36,807
I got the feeling you're
fixing to make a point.

705
01:12:37,432 --> 01:12:40,394
Dal can't say how he feels about
a woman, and you run from it.

706
01:12:40,477 --> 01:12:45,107
I'm not running. I mean,
Kate, you know how it is.

707
01:12:47,234 --> 01:12:50,153
Well, I am running,
I'm running for sheriff.

708
01:12:52,114 --> 01:12:55,367
There is no room in my
life right now for a woman.

709
01:12:55,909 --> 01:12:59,204
The trouble with you, Mac
Traven, is you're gun-shy.

710
01:13:00,455 --> 01:13:03,292
Well, let me put it this way.

711
01:13:05,335 --> 01:13:07,671
Somebody like you comes along...

712
01:13:07,754 --> 01:13:11,133
I might consider it. Now cool down.

713
01:13:33,822 --> 01:13:36,700
It's like a damn
hornet's nest down there.

714
01:13:36,992 --> 01:13:40,704
If you got a plan, Jack, you
better be letting me in on it.

715
01:13:41,246 --> 01:13:44,958
You know, you never asked
me how I got this tequila.

716
01:13:46,251 --> 01:13:47,336
How?

717
01:13:48,503 --> 01:13:52,007
Stole it. Just like I did this.

718
01:13:54,843 --> 01:13:56,345
I got a plan.

719
01:13:57,888 --> 01:14:02,100
Quit worrying about that woman, will
you? She's a tough one, and smart.

720
01:14:02,184 --> 01:14:05,228
You know that. And when
the shooting starts...

721
01:14:05,479 --> 01:14:08,190
she'll be there to
look after the girls.

722
01:14:09,691 --> 01:14:12,778
We'll take care of her,
Dal. That's a promise.

723
01:14:17,324 --> 01:14:19,367
I'm gonna hold you to it.

724
01:15:13,922 --> 01:15:15,423
You looking for someone?

725
01:15:15,507 --> 01:15:19,719
I heard at the mission some women
were brought in. I'd like to see them.

726
01:15:19,761 --> 01:15:22,097
This is not a good place for you.

727
01:15:22,222 --> 01:15:24,099
Take me to them, please.

728
01:15:50,417 --> 01:15:52,002
How you boys doing?

729
01:15:52,043 --> 01:15:53,712
Haven't seen you for a while.

730
01:15:53,795 --> 01:15:56,715
Figured either a lawman or
a husband finally got you.

731
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:59,259
There's a few of them
chasing me, I guess.

732
01:15:59,342 --> 01:16:00,510
Who's he?

733
01:16:00,635 --> 01:16:02,304
This is my nephew.

734
01:16:04,014 --> 01:16:05,515
Go on through.

735
01:16:11,771 --> 01:16:13,607
That wasn't too hard.

736
01:16:31,666 --> 01:16:34,461
Sister, will you pray for me?

737
01:16:36,046 --> 01:16:37,797
Of course, my child.

738
01:16:43,595 --> 01:16:45,347
I'm Sister Katherine.

739
01:17:08,703 --> 01:17:10,121
Uncle Jack...

740
01:17:11,164 --> 01:17:15,293
I know you got a plan, but don't
you think you ought to fill me in?

741
01:17:16,753 --> 01:17:18,755
Here, you might need this.

742
01:17:46,574 --> 01:17:47,700
Kate!

743
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:51,913
Mac is here. So's Jesse and Dal.

744
01:17:53,498 --> 01:17:55,166
You mean they're alive?

745
01:17:55,208 --> 01:17:57,460
They're going to get you out of here.

746
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:05,760
You're intruding, sir.

747
01:18:05,885 --> 01:18:07,387
I'm sorry, Sister.

748
01:18:07,512 --> 01:18:11,933
But I couldn't help noticing, despite
the habit, that you're quite young.

749
01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:16,104
And now I can't help wondering what
you'd look like without that outfit.

750
01:18:16,187 --> 01:18:18,982
I am a nun. Have you no conscience?

751
01:18:19,858 --> 01:18:22,193
Not when there's a profit in it.

752
01:18:24,946 --> 01:18:28,032
Hello, Kate. Welcome to Mexico.

753
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:36,291
You all know what the old maid
said to the cowpuncher, don't you?

754
01:18:36,416 --> 01:18:38,710
- No.
- You tell them, Uncle Jack.

755
01:18:41,129 --> 01:18:42,630
Come on, amigos.

756
01:18:42,755 --> 01:18:45,300
It's been a long, hard
trail, and I'm buying.

757
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:57,604
Damn, it won't take forever
for that posse to get here.

758
01:18:57,687 --> 01:18:59,480
What're they waiting on?

759
01:18:59,564 --> 01:19:01,649
Jack said to wait for his signal.

760
01:19:01,691 --> 01:19:03,109
What signal?

761
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:06,070
Said we couldn't miss it.

762
01:19:17,832 --> 01:19:19,334
Come on, amigo!

763
01:19:19,459 --> 01:19:21,628
Hold on. I'll be right there.

764
01:19:42,273 --> 01:19:44,484
I reckon that's Uncle Jack's signal.

765
01:19:46,694 --> 01:19:48,363
I'll take the one on the left.

766
01:19:48,446 --> 01:19:49,697
Got you.

767
01:20:02,085 --> 01:20:04,420
Bring her to my car. Them, too.

768
01:20:04,712 --> 01:20:05,838
No!

769
01:20:46,379 --> 01:20:47,839
Thanks, Uncle Jack.

770
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:52,885
Here come Dal and Jesse.

771
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:07,066
Come on, come on.

772
01:21:11,237 --> 01:21:13,156
Let's go.

773
01:21:27,253 --> 01:21:29,589
Tell the engineer to get moving, now!

774
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:43,019
I'm gonna get the girls.

775
01:21:45,813 --> 01:21:47,356
Find the girls.

776
01:21:53,905 --> 01:21:55,489
Hi, Uncle Jack.

777
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:08,336
- Where's the Travens?
- On the train.

778
01:22:13,341 --> 01:22:15,051
Get down!

779
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:50,127
Thank God you're alive.

780
01:22:50,211 --> 01:22:51,504
Get back.

781
01:22:59,345 --> 01:23:00,805
Where's Kate and the girls?

782
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:22,576
By God, I ought to kill you
for what you done to my family.

783
01:23:23,911 --> 01:23:25,287
Then do it.

784
01:23:30,126 --> 01:23:32,753
This killing's got to stop somewhere.

785
01:23:36,173 --> 01:23:38,384
I recall this belongs to you.

786
01:23:41,178 --> 01:23:42,972
Makes us even, Major.

787
01:24:13,461 --> 01:24:16,714
Dal, Hammond's got the
girls and Kate on the train.

788
01:24:44,658 --> 01:24:47,119
Looks like somebody started a war.

789
01:24:51,624 --> 01:24:53,292
Everybody's dead?

790
01:24:53,584 --> 01:24:56,212
There's gotta be somebody around here.

791
01:25:56,188 --> 01:25:57,898
Mac, watch out!

792
01:26:00,985 --> 01:26:02,528
Mac, watch out!

793
01:27:08,802 --> 01:27:11,472
We'll be getting into
Chihuahua tonight.

794
01:27:11,555 --> 01:27:15,225
Perhaps the day after you'd
care to go on into Mexico City.

795
01:27:38,332 --> 01:27:42,878
Colonel Hammond, are you going to
keep the brandy all to yourself?

796
01:27:44,796 --> 01:27:48,967
Why, no. No, not at
all. Please sit down.

797
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:11,365
Stop this train.

798
01:28:11,949 --> 01:28:13,283
Do it now!

799
01:28:44,982 --> 01:28:46,316
Whoa, cowboy.

800
01:28:50,362 --> 01:28:51,738
Jack Traven!

801
01:28:53,407 --> 01:28:55,075
I ain't seen him.

802
01:29:40,537 --> 01:29:42,497
- You all right?
- Yes, you?

803
01:29:43,832 --> 01:29:45,167
Stay here.

804
01:30:01,641 --> 01:30:05,395
You boys are in enough trouble.
You best get out of the way.

805
01:30:05,479 --> 01:30:09,691
Sorry, Sheriff, can't
do that. We want Jack.

806
01:30:10,358 --> 01:30:14,988
Now, I know why you boys come down here.
I'm sorry for what happened to your family...

807
01:30:15,363 --> 01:30:19,117
but I got a job to do. Jack
Traven is going back to Texas.

808
01:30:19,534 --> 01:30:23,246
We're all going back to Texas.
Uncle Jack's riding with us.

809
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:26,166
You boys busted your
Uncle Jack out of jail.

810
01:30:26,249 --> 01:30:28,293
Now, I'm willing to let that slide.

811
01:30:28,376 --> 01:30:32,005
You ain't got no authority
down here. What'd he do anyway?

812
01:30:32,797 --> 01:30:34,257
What'd he do?

813
01:30:35,926 --> 01:30:38,887
This man's a horse
thief, a renegade...

814
01:30:39,304 --> 01:30:42,057
a double-dealing,
lying, womanising...

815
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:44,518
Womanising ain't against the law.

816
01:30:44,768 --> 01:30:49,147
Go on, tell them, Gillette, how you been
setting on your rump for all these years...

817
01:30:49,231 --> 01:30:52,943
all of a sudden you start chasing
me till I about turned into raw meat.

818
01:30:53,026 --> 01:30:55,445
You just been running loose too long.

819
01:30:55,529 --> 01:30:58,198
There's more to it than that.
You tell them, or I will.

820
01:30:58,281 --> 01:31:00,450
I'll carve your tongue out, Jack.

821
01:31:00,534 --> 01:31:02,536
You better tell us, Miles.

822
01:31:06,164 --> 01:31:08,124
He's been after my wife.

823
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:15,215
That ain't all of it.

824
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:18,551
That wife of yours has
been chasing me for years...

825
01:31:18,802 --> 01:31:21,137
and I just got tired of running.

826
01:31:22,472 --> 01:31:25,642
I caught them together.
And I'm taking him in.

827
01:31:26,351 --> 01:31:29,271
You take one Traven,
you gotta take them all.

828
01:31:32,899 --> 01:31:35,068
Sorry it had to come to this.

829
01:31:37,404 --> 01:31:39,406
Maybe it doesn't have to.

830
01:31:39,906 --> 01:31:44,286
Make you a trade, Sheriff. Holiday
Hammond for "Black Jack" Traven.

831
01:31:44,995 --> 01:31:47,914
Hammond's a big fish
compared to Uncle Jack.

832
01:31:49,749 --> 01:31:54,421
Mean a lot more to you fellas riding back
into Texas with Holiday Hammond in tow.

833
01:31:54,504 --> 01:31:56,965
Been on the wanted
list almost 20 years.

834
01:31:57,090 --> 01:31:59,968
Most wanted man in
Texas, the way I hear it.

835
01:32:02,762 --> 01:32:04,973
You boys got yourself a trade.

836
01:32:07,517 --> 01:32:09,144
You'd have loved Mexico City.

837
01:32:09,269 --> 01:32:12,063
Maybe, but you'd never
have seen it alive.

838
01:32:14,733 --> 01:32:17,235
Kate, I might have died a happy man.

839
01:32:27,412 --> 01:32:31,541
Jack Traven, I don't want to ever
see you around Big Springs again.

840
01:32:31,624 --> 01:32:34,294
Afraid you got no say
in the matter, Gillette.

841
01:32:34,419 --> 01:32:38,715
See, I'm gonna be the next sheriff
of Big Springs. See you at the polls.

842
01:33:01,738 --> 01:33:04,032
Give my regards to your wife.

843
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:14,125
Jack Traven for Holiday Hammond.

844
01:33:14,584 --> 01:33:17,337
You boys sure did get
the best of that trade.

845
01:33:17,462 --> 01:33:19,547
That's a matter of opinion.

846
01:33:37,774 --> 01:33:39,108
- Upsy-daisy.
- Sorry.

847
01:33:49,327 --> 01:33:51,204
Got room for one more?

848
