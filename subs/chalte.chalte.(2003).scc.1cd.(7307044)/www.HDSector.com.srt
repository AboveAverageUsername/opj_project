5
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,960
Sta mislis o mom potezu. Razbija!

6
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:55,299
Izgleda kao da ti se nije svideo.
- Opusti se. Nije bas najbolje.

7
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,720
Nisi osvojio svetski kup.
- Sta rade oni sa tim uopste?

8
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,723
Zdravo ljudi! Dugo se nismo videli!
Gde ste bili?

9
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:06,310
Ko je ono sa Deepak-om?
- Meni izgleda kao da je devojka.

10
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,816
"Hvala, hvala"

11
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,738
"Hey Deepak, kako si ti?"

12
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:23,327
"Upoznajte Aditya-u. A ovo je
njegova prelepa zena, Rashmi"

13
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,747
A ovo je Vivek;
on jos uvek trazi devojku

14
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,333
I upoznajte moju verenicu... Sheetal

15
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,337
Nisi nam rekao da si se verio!
- Divno druze!

16
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,007
"Desilo se veoma brzo,
Ni ja nisam shvatio"

17
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,761
Ti nikad nista ne shvatas.
- Polako... molim vas sedite

18
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,014
"Ona dolazi ovde po prvi put,
a vi narode..."

19
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,351
"Vivek, zasto sve ovo? Salim
me je zvao i zamolio da se nadjemo ovde"

20
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,354
Ali nije mi rekao zbog cega.
Znas li ti zasto smo se nasli ovde?

21
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,776
On uvek taji svoje razloge.
Salim ti si? Gde si?

22
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:58,780
Cekamo te ovde!
Sta? Zaglavio si se u saobracaju?

23
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,784
"Pozuri, kazem!
Sta...? U redu"

24
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,120
Jos uvek je u zaglavljen.
- To je njegov uobicajeni izgovor

25
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,792
Koja je ovo knjiga?
- Ljubavna prica

26
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,797
"Ako bi neko mogao da ima ovakvu romansu
u stvarnom zivotu, bilo bi fenomenalno"

27
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,134
"Deepak, jesi li joj ispricao
Raj-ovu ljubavnu pricu?"

28
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,803
"Ne, nisam imao priliku.
- Ti si lud"

29
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,556
"Da si joj ispricao, ona ne bi
pricala ovako"

30
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,394
Da li hoces da mi kazes da se bajkovite
romanse dogadjaju cak i u stvarnom zivotu?

31
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,399
Ne verujem u to.
- Cekaj prvo da je cujes pricu

32
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,403
Reci cu ti kako su se upoznali...
- Samo momenat. Vec si poceo!

33
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,407
"Pre toga, reci joj
nesto o Raj-u"

34
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,827
"Momenat. Ja cu joj reci...
- Ne, ja cu joj reci"

35
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,834
Raj je iz Punjab-a.
Njegov otac tamo ima farmu

36
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,420
Znaci Raj...
- je farmer?

37
00:04:56,837 --> 00:05:00,841
"Ne, Raj je zeleo da postane inzenjer.
Pa se preselio u grad"

38
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,553
Znaci Raj je inzenjer?

39
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:06,847
"Ne, mada je dosao u grad
da uci inzenjering, on je..."

40
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,433
zapoceo export biznis.
- I sada...

41
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,061
sigurno nije ni u export
biznisu?

42
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,857
"Taj vas Raj...
on radi nesto, zar ne?"

43
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,861
"To je Raj. Ono sto je
zeleo, nikada nije radio"

44
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:24,865
"A ono sto je radio,
nije ni pomislio da ce raditi!"

45
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,887
"Hello, Raj!
- Kako si?"

46
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,890
Daj mi taj kasetofon...
- Ne diraj to

47
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,476
"Slusam muziku "Gadar"
"i Sunny Deol je moj miljenik"

48
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,897
"Raj, stigao si iz Bangalore-a za
tri dana umesto dva?"

49
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,900
I trebalo ti je tri dana
umesto dva!

50
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:03,904
Pa sta cu. Moj kamion je odugovlacio
i zakasnio sam

51
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,824
"Znaci moj kamion je krntija, eh!
Znas sta?"

52
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:10,286
Tri devojke su iskocile pred moj kamion
na Pune-ovoj stanici i rekao...

53
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,912
zet je ovde!

54
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,915
Upoznaje devojke a kaze mi
da mi je kamion krntija!

55
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:20,921
"Stavio sam nove gume na kamion,
ima rotacioni kompresioni motor"

56
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,924
Onda nemoj da koristis kerozin.
Koristi Castrol lubrikant ulje

57
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,927
"Vise nemas izgovora
za kasnjenje, okay?"

58
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:30,848
"Raj, telefon.
- Pa? U cemu je stvar?"

59
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:33,184
To je vlasnik Tradelinka.
- Tradelinka!

60
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,520
Daj mi ga! Brzo!

61
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,954
"Kako sam mogao da zaboravim sastanak!
Momci, gde su mi cizme?"

62
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,956
"Mora da su ovde, Raj"

63
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,889
Sonofagun! Prestani da pevas!

64
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:18,979
Kamioni jos uvek nisu stigli tamo?
Nemoguce. Raspitacu se odmah

65
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,986
Zasto kamioni nisu
jos uvek stigli tamo?

66
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,991
Oni su na pumpi zbog vazduha...
- Sredicu vas! Moroni!

67
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:59,603
"Kamioni ce biti tamo, gospodine.
Kada? Pitacu mog inzinjera"

68
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,024
"Koliko je potrebno da budu spremni?
On pita, moroni!"

69
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:06,610
Bice potrebno bar pola sata.
- Pola sata...?

70
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,029
Isprebijacu vas momci!

71
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:14,034
"Kamion ce biti tamo...
svakog trenutka, gospodine"

72
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:20,040
"Zvacu sa fiksnog na mobilni.
Praticu to, zasigurno"

73
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:25,963
Moramo se naci kod Oberoi's.
Ja tamo rucam

74
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:37,057
Proklet bio! Pozuri!

75
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,319
"Volela bih da upoznam Raj-a.
- Naravno, zasto da ne"

76
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,071
Svako ko cuje za njega
kaze istu stvar

77
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,325
Pricali ste mi
Raj-ovu ljubavnu pricu

78
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:56,994
Sad mi pricajte o devojci
iz te ljubavne price

79
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,288
Devojci...?
To je Priya

80
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:08,672
"Ustvari, Priya je iz Grcke.
Ona je tamo rodjena i odrasla"

81
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:12,092
"Nakon mature, ona je
dosla u Indiju, kod tetke"

82
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:17,097
Njena prva revija je imala
veliki uspeh...

83
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,740
Kakva razlika izmedju
Raj-a i Priye

84
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,077
Kako su se upoznali?

85
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,748
Na autoputu. Za vreme udesa.
- Udesa?

86
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:28,752
"Da, pravi udes.
Na putu za Mahabaleshwar..."

87
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:31,421
sudarili su se Raj-ov kamion
i Priyin auto

88
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:09,793
Vozacu! Zar ne znas da vozis...?
Mogla je da se dogodi nesreca!

89
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,212
"To je vasa greska, gospodjo.
Ovo je veliki kamion..."

90
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:18,552
Pa? Zar ne znas da vozis?
Sta da se desila nesreca?

91
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,221
Ko ti dade dozvoli?
- Dozvolu!

92
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,817
Govoris Engleski. Mislis li
da ce te vozac razumeti?

93
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,238
"Govoris Hindi, zar ne?"

94
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,258
"Mozda je nem, Priya"

95
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,510
Raj...
- Cuti!

96
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,849
Nije nem!
Kazes meni da cutim!

97
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:08,268
Ne tebi. Njemu

98
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,272
"Mozes da mu kazes da cuti,
mozes da zuris u mene..."

99
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:15,859
ali ne mozes da mi kazes "izvini"
Svi muskarci ste isti!

100
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,871
Pogledaj...
- Ja? Ti pogledaj...

101
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,873
kako si vozio taj kamion!

102
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,878
Dole! Dole!

103
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,299
"Nije dole, vec iza
- Moj auto je dolazio otpozadi"

104
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,303
Ja sam samo preticala.
- Tvoj auto odlazi pozadi

105
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:48,892
"Kazi mi, odakle 
moj auto odlazi?"

106
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,895
Sad je vec otisao

107
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:03,323
"Ti si rekla da dolazi otpozadi,
Ja sam reako da se odlazi pozadi..."

108
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,325
Otisao je

109
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:36,940
"Kao Salimova mlada, izgledas
bas kao Anarkali danas"

110
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,359
Izvoli poklon

111
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,364
Pa? Izgleda da si danas u
pesnickom raspolozenju?

112
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:46,950
"Da izgledas drugacije.
- Dupla prilika"

113
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,953
"Na Muslimanskoj svadbi, Ja
mogu da postanem pesnik..."

114
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,372
a to je zbog onoga sto mi se desilo
na putu ovamo

115
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:54,958
Sta se desilo na tom putu?
- Udes sa devojkom

116
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,378
"Stvarno? Je l' sve u redu?
- Nije sve u redu, Salim!"

117
00:13:58,461 --> 00:14:02,632
"Zasigurno nije!
Upoznao sam devojku, Izgubio devojku"

118
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,968
I ne znam da li cu je
ikada videti ponovo

119
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:09,973
Ali kakva devojka!
kakva devojka...!

120
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,400
"Ona je ta!
Ko je ona, Salim?"

121
00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:22,986
Koja?
- U beloj haljini!

122
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,489
"To je moja drugarica, Priya.
- Lepa drugarica, stvarno!"

123
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,993
Ona dolazi ovamo. Pitaj je samo
kako je prosao njen put

124
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,494
Sta?
- Bez pitanja

125
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:33,663
"Razvedi se od nje, Salim. Ona se
mnogo pita. Samo je pitaj to!"

126
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:47,427
"Priya, kako je prosao tvoj put?"

127
00:14:50,513 --> 00:14:53,350
Tesno..Imala sam
veliki udes sa kamionom

128
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,437
Cak sam i zaustavila kamion.
Ali je vozac bio bas cudan!

129
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:04,027
"Vozaci kamiona su pravi drznici.
- Ne, on nije bio drzak"

130
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:08,448
"Ja sam ga uporno psovala,
a on je samo gledao u mene"

131
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,451
I sta se onda desilo?
- Kao i obicno...

132
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:15,705
Zaboravila sam da podignem rucnu
i auto je zavrsio u jarku

133
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:19,459
"Pa mogao je da zaustavi tvoj auto, ja mislim.
- Ne..."

134
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,048
Krenuo je napred da zaustavi auto.
Ali ja ga nisam razumela...

135
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:28,468
i sprecila sam ga.
- Znaci nije los u srcu?

136
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,388
"Da, to sam
i ja razmisljala"

137
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,474
"Trebalo je da mu kazem "Hvala"
zar ne?"

138
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,476
Pa kazi sada

139
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:51,408
Mozda ne mozes da me prepoznas.
Mozda moram da obucem lungi and kurta?

140
00:15:51,574 --> 00:15:53,076
To sam bio ja

141
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,082
"Iako izgleda kao
vozac kamiona, ipak nije takav"

142
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:01,918
On vodi transport buznis.
- Mali

143
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,505
"Ovo je Priya, moja posebna drugarica.
- Vec sam je upoznao..."

144
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:07,924
ali drago mi je da sam te upoznao
ponovo

145
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:10,093
"Hajde da se slikamo.
- Oh naravno, hajde"

146
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,515
"Sara, pomeri se u stranu...
ovamo..."

147
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,524
"Bila sam ljuta tada,
ali sam kasnije shvatila..."

148
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:27,944
da sam pogresila.
- Ja sam znao sve vreme...

149
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,531
da gresis.
- Rekla sam previse...

150
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:33,783
u nastupu besa.
- Rekla si previse!

151
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,451
Ali ti si sve vreme bio tih

152
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:41,124
"Kada si ljuta, imas
neobicne iskre u svojim ocima"

153
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:45,545
"Stvarno je tako. Ti to ne mozes da primetis,
zato sto si ljuta"

154
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,548
I ja sam uporno gledao u njih.
I nisam obracao paznju...

155
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,134
sta je ispravno a sta pogresno

156
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,138
Trazim ti oprostaj
za to sto se dogodilo

157
00:16:57,557 --> 00:17:00,143
"Izvini" nije dovoljno.
- Nego?

158
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:02,562
Moras da dobijes kaznu.
- Kaznu?

159
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:06,566
Kakvu kaznu?
- Tvoja kazna je...

160
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:09,152
Ici ces iz Mahabaleshwar
u Mumbai sa mnom sutra

161
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:13,823
U kamionu.
- Kamionu?

162
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:16,159
Kako cu...?
- Bez odbijanja

163
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:19,162
"Rekla si mi da ugrozavam drustvo,
stvarno sam se osecao lose"

164
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:23,583
Bio sam duboko povredjen.
Ne mozes me odbiti. Molim te...

165
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:48,191
"Izvini, to je bila musica"

166
00:17:53,863 --> 00:17:57,617
Sareni svet...

167
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:02,205
i ljudi sa svih strana

168
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:10,213
Da se sretnu i rastave...

169
00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:16,219
deo je sudbine

170
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:24,644
Prisustvuju igrama kao sto je ova...

171
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,652
"Leprsavost je
u mom srcu"

172
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:55,258
"U stotine nijansi, svet je
jedinstveno mesto"

173
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,261
Zato ne zadrzavaj srce

174
00:18:58,928 --> 00:19:02,682
"U Zemlju ljubavi,
podjimo"

175
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:08,688
"Ja idem tamo, svakako.
Zato kreni sa mnom"

176
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:49,729
"kada tvoj sal poleti,
u visinu..."

177
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:52,732
nas put je osvetljen

178
00:19:54,108 --> 00:19:57,320
"kada moj sal poleti,
u visinu..."

179
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,740
nas put je osvetljen

180
00:20:01,824 --> 00:20:05,077
"Na svakom skretanju,
je neka nova prica..."

181
00:20:05,828 --> 00:20:08,748
za tebe i mene

182
00:20:09,665 --> 00:20:11,751
Na nasem putu...

183
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:16,339
Mi hum

184
00:20:17,006 --> 00:20:20,343
"Vetrovi koji duvaju
govore nam..."

185
00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:28,768
"Gde ste, O putnici?
Dodjite nam"

186
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:33,356
"U Zemlju ljubavi,
podjimo"

187
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:38,778
"Ja idem tamo svakako.
Zato kreni sa mnom"

188
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:04,804
"O Madhav,
gde si?"

189
00:21:11,185 --> 00:21:14,188
Ja idem tamo gde moja mlada je

190
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:35,835
Oblaci susrecu planine...

191
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:39,422
pcele susrecu pupoljke

192
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:51,434
"Reka tece
u napusteno korito..."

193
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:54,854
da susretne okean

194
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:57,857
Polako...

195
00:21:59,942 --> 00:22:01,861
Polako...

196
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:06,866
"Pesme ljubavi
sto u potocima teku..."

197
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,870
"teraju ptice da pevaju
u harmoniji..."

198
00:22:11,454 --> 00:22:14,874
"Sa sasrevanjem da se susretnemo,
slusaj sta govori..."

199
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:20,463
"U zemlju ljubavi,
podjimo"

200
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:25,885
"Ja tamo svakako idem.
Zato kreni sa mnom"

201
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:30,950
Sidji!

202
00:23:32,534 --> 00:23:34,954
"Sta je bilo, pozornice?
Zasto ste me zaustavili?"

203
00:23:35,537 --> 00:23:37,957
Zasto? Zar ne vidis put...?

204
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,542
"Sta se dogodilo?
- Nista, sredicu to"

205
00:23:41,543 --> 00:23:46,548
Prvi put u zivotu vidim kako momak
zavodi devojku u kamionu!

206
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:49,051
Dobar stil.
- Kakav stil?

207
00:23:49,218 --> 00:23:52,221
Momak ce povesti devojku u onome 
sto ima. Sta je problem?

208
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:56,267
"Nisam ja taj koji ima problem, sine.
Vidis tu tablu? Sta pise tamo?"

209
00:23:57,142 --> 00:24:00,229
Ne vidim iz daleka.
- Mozes li ti?

210
00:24:00,896 --> 00:24:02,982
Kazacu ti. Nema prolaza

211
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:07,987
"Pomeraj kamion odavde. 'Ajde.
- Samo dva minuta, gospodine"

212
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,990
Odvescu je samo malo dalje
i odatle cu na autoput

213
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:14,994
"Ti mislis da su saobracajni zakoni sala?
- Raj, ne brini"

214
00:24:15,577 --> 00:24:17,579
Otici cu sama.
- Cujes ovo?

215
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:21,000
Sirotica kaze da ce sama!
- Ali ja sam tu njoj na usluzi!

216
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:25,587
Sklanjaj kamion odavde! Odmah!
- Dobro

217
00:24:25,754 --> 00:24:29,008
Zar je ovo i zona "nema pozdrava"?
Mogu li bar da se pozdravim? Molim te?

218
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:30,134
Hajde

219
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:40,269
Ovo je za tebe... Secerna trska

220
00:24:48,193 --> 00:24:50,612
Sto stojis tu?
Idi za devojkom

221
00:24:51,613 --> 00:24:54,033
"Ti pomeri kamion.
- Okay, ti..."

222
00:25:06,628 --> 00:25:08,630
Pozvacu kasnije

223
00:25:10,966 --> 00:25:12,301
Pozvacu kasnije

224
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:19,057
Momenat...
On kaze da ce te pozvati kasnijer

225
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:22,644
Ali on uopste nije
uzeo moj broj telefona

226
00:25:23,645 --> 00:25:25,647
Nisi uzeo njen broj?
- Ne

227
00:25:26,148 --> 00:25:28,650
"Pa uzmi!
- Da, samo sekund"

228
00:25:29,151 --> 00:25:32,070
Sta nameravas?
- Pitaj je... broj?

229
00:25:33,655 --> 00:25:35,073
Koji je broj?

230
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,672
Govori jasno.
- Jesam. Broj je 3

231
00:25:51,006 --> 00:25:52,174
Zasto vices?

232
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:54,676
U redu je

233
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,016
Kazi joj cao.
Kazi cao

234
00:26:14,696 --> 00:26:17,115
Dosta. Odlazi

235
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:22,246
Sta...?

236
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:55,153
"Gde si do sad, Priya...?
- Teto! Samo probaj ovaj korak!"

237
00:26:57,239 --> 00:27:00,158
Trebalo je da budes ovde u podne.
A sad je vec 6

238
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:02,411
Jesi li ikada ukrala
secesrnu trsku iz polja?

239
00:27:04,162 --> 00:27:07,165
Jesi li ovu ukrala?
- Kad sam rekla...

240
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:10,168
Ukrala sam secernu trsku iz polja?
I farmer je trcao za mnom?

241
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:13,171
Kako veliki stap!
- Jesi li dobro?

242
00:27:13,255 --> 00:27:16,174
"Znas li sta govoris?
- Da, teto. Ja sam savrseno dobro!"

243
00:27:16,425 --> 00:27:19,177
Idi sad i istusiraj se.
Izgledas tako prljavo

244
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:21,763
"Dobro. Ima vode
u rucnoj pumpi, nadam se?"

245
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,433
"Da, ima
Rucna pumpa?"

246
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:28,186
Ima vode na tusu!
Sta je spopalo ovu devojku?

247
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,771
Izludece me jednog dana

248
00:27:30,772 --> 00:27:34,192
Da li je to bio Priyin glas?
- Otisla je da se kupa

249
00:27:34,776 --> 00:27:37,279
Cekao sam je ceo dan
a ti joj to cak nisi ni rekla?

250
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:42,200
"Zaboravila sam, sine. Ona je
govorila cudne stvari"

251
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:45,954
Idem odmah da joj kazem.
- Nemoj ti. Ja cu da je iznenadim

252
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:55,213
"Najhrabriji ce
odvesti mladu"

253
00:28:04,806 --> 00:28:07,809
"Nandu, ti uvek pevas
tu pesmu. Pevaj ovu..."

254
00:28:11,813 --> 00:28:15,233
Dobra pesma.
- Dobra? Pa pevaj je onda

255
00:28:21,156 --> 00:28:25,827
"Najrabriji ce
odvesti mladu"

256
00:28:25,994 --> 00:28:29,247
"Nema nade za tebe, Nandu.
To je pesma koju ces uvek pevati"

257
00:28:29,498 --> 00:28:32,834
"Srecan sam dok pevam ovu pesmu.
Jedan zivot, jedna zena..."

258
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:37,255
"jedna ljubav i jedna pesma.
- To je moje pravilo, takodje"

259
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:40,842
"Jedan zivot, jedna zena,
jedna ljubav, jedna pesma"

260
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:47,349
Znaci tako su se Raj i Priza upoznali?
- Upoznali?

261
00:28:47,516 --> 00:28:49,559
To je bio samo njihov prvi susret

262
00:28:49,851 --> 00:28:54,856
"Kada bi se ljubavnici upoznavali tako lako,
onda ne bi imali ljubavnu pricu"

263
00:28:55,357 --> 00:28:59,861
"Kad su se toliko voleli,
gde je bio problem?"

264
00:29:00,195 --> 00:29:05,867
Gde...? Problem je bio parce papira
na koji je Raj napisao Priyin broj

265
00:29:06,368 --> 00:29:10,288
Ovo je krajnja granica! Trebao si bar
da proveris pre nego sto si oprao odecu!

266
00:29:10,872 --> 00:29:15,877
Svaka pralja prvo proveri dzepove
pre nego sto krene sa pranjem...

267
00:29:16,044 --> 00:29:18,672
da vidi da li je neko ostavio
neke pare u njima

268
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,300
"Za ovih pet godina, nisam mogao
naci penny u tvojim dzepovima"

269
00:29:22,384 --> 00:29:24,886
I sad sam prestao da proveravam.
- Jesi li?

270
00:29:27,556 --> 00:29:30,892
"Raj, napravila sam malo
vruce dhokla. Dodji kod nas"

271
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:33,895
"Snajka, nista od dhokli...
Manubhai, reci joj da ide"

272
00:29:34,229 --> 00:29:37,899
"Idi, Savita. Znas li kakvu
tenziju imamo ovde?"

273
00:29:38,066 --> 00:29:39,901
Pokusavamo da nadjemo Priyin broj

274
00:29:40,902 --> 00:29:44,322
Koju bese prijateljicu Priya ima i Pune-u?
- Fara

275
00:29:44,406 --> 00:29:46,908
Fara! Pozovi je i
uzmi broj od nje

276
00:29:47,075 --> 00:29:48,910
Fara i Salim have
su se tek vencali

277
00:29:49,077 --> 00:29:51,580
"Otisli su na medeni mesec,
Ne znam gde"

278
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:56,918
Sta je ovo? Kako je moja kosulja
dospela u Raj-ovu kucu?

279
00:29:58,086 --> 00:30:01,339
Vidis? Trazio sam ovu kosulju
a ona lezi ovde!

280
00:30:01,464 --> 00:30:03,592
Ti brines zbog kosulje?
Ja imam problem. Daj mi ideju

281
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:06,928
"Tvoj problem ces ti resiti.
Ovo je Ganpat uradio!"

282
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:10,348
Najradije bi smo ga predali policiji.
- Policiji...?

283
00:30:22,944 --> 00:30:27,365
Koliko ces puta to reci?
Broj telefona ima ima osam brojki!

284
00:30:27,449 --> 00:30:29,367
To je tesko za mene.
- Zasto?

285
00:30:29,617 --> 00:30:33,371
Ja sam saobracajac. Ja moram da pamtim
samo cetiri brojke sa tablica

286
00:30:33,955 --> 00:30:36,791
Pa sta ja sad treba da radim?
- Zasto ne odes kod nje kuci?

287
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,963
Plasis se devojcinog
oca. Zar ne?

288
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,383
Plasio bih se kada bi znao gde ona
zivi. To je bio nas prvi sastanak

289
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:49,387
"I ti si bio taj koji me je zaustavio.
- Ovo je prava zbrka, stvarno"

290
00:30:49,971 --> 00:30:53,975
"Ona zasigurno zivi u ovoj oblasti. Ona
je pesacila onaj dan kuci, zar ne?"

291
00:30:54,309 --> 00:31:00,398
U pravu si. Znas sta?
pitacemo prodavca Betel-lisca

292
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,410
Reci mu.
- Trazim jednu devojku

293
00:31:12,577 --> 00:31:15,413
Ona zivi ovde negde.
Reci cu ti kako izgleda...

294
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:21,419
"Tiwari, zauzet sam praveci Betel-lisce.
Ne gledam u devojke"

295
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:25,423
Znas Laxman-a?
On stalno ocijuka sa devojkama

296
00:31:25,673 --> 00:31:28,635
Odvedi ga kod njega.
Saznaces

297
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:32,430
"Ne, Tiwari. Ja gledam samo u Radhu.
Ni jednu drugu"

298
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,017
"Razmisli, Laxman! Razmisli!
- Ne plasi se mene"

299
00:31:36,184 --> 00:31:38,436
Jadnicak je veoma ocajan.
Reci mu ako znas

300
00:31:38,686 --> 00:31:41,439
Ali ja ne znam.
- Sve se to dogodilo zbog mene

301
00:31:42,023 --> 00:31:45,026
"Ali ja sam radio svoju duznost...
i rekao sam "izvini", zar ne?"

302
00:31:45,193 --> 00:31:49,447
Imam ideju. Postar Ganga
ti moze dati adresu

303
00:31:50,031 --> 00:31:52,450
U pravu je! Idemo

304
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:56,037
Daj mi cokoladu.
- Uzmi moje srce.

305
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:06,047
Priya Chopra? Postoji jedan Chopra
koji zivi u Swapnalok

306
00:32:06,214 --> 00:32:09,384
"Ima dva sina,
ali nema kceri"

307
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:13,054
"Ganga, postoji Chopra
u Akashgangi takodje, zar ne?"

308
00:32:13,221 --> 00:32:15,473
"On ima cerku takodje, zar ne?
- Da, ima li cerku?"

309
00:32:15,723 --> 00:32:17,058
Samo momenat

310
00:32:17,725 --> 00:32:24,065
"Rustom, ta devojcica ima osam godina.
Osam godina"

311
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:27,485
"Ne, moja je malo starija.
- Starija, zar ne?"

312
00:32:27,861 --> 00:32:30,738
Ima jos jedan Chopra
koji ima samo jednu cerku

313
00:32:31,072 --> 00:32:34,075
Ali ona zivi u Australiji
sa svojom tetkom

314
00:32:35,076 --> 00:32:37,912
To je dobro!
Priya zivi sa svojom tetkom takodje!

315
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:41,499
Pa kazi mi tetkino ime.
- Naravno. Tetkino ime je...

316
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:44,085
Ne znam.
- On ne zna

317
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:48,089
"On ne zna nista, Tiwari.
Kako cemo je naci?"

318
00:32:48,423 --> 00:32:50,758
"Pa sta cemo da radimo, Raj?
Ni on ne zna nista"

319
00:32:51,426 --> 00:32:55,513
"Kako sta da radimo...? Sta god ko da kaze,
Ja sam siguran..."

320
00:32:56,097 --> 00:33:00,518
"Ja cu naci moju Priyu.
Sa tetkom, bez tetke"

321
00:33:03,104 --> 00:33:06,107
"Kako ce je naci?
Nema ime, nema adresu..."

322
00:33:07,108 --> 00:33:11,112
Naci ce je!
I te kako! U tankom vazduhu!

323
00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:17,118
Nestala...

324
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,541
neko je nestao

325
00:33:24,459 --> 00:33:26,544
gde je ona?

326
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:41,142
"Bio sam ovde,
a i ona je"

327
00:33:41,643 --> 00:33:45,563
"Ja sam opet ovde,
ali ona nije"

328
00:33:45,688 --> 00:33:47,565
Nestala...

329
00:33:58,576 --> 00:34:02,163
"Ona je veoma lepa.
Ona stanuje negde ovde..."

330
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,165
ali je nestala

331
00:34:06,876 --> 00:34:10,588
"Ona je vila,
primamljiva, divna..."

332
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:12,590
ona je nestala

333
00:34:15,343 --> 00:34:19,597
"Ja je trazim
svim svojim srcem i dusom..."

334
00:34:27,188 --> 00:34:31,192
"Trazio sam je po celome svetu
pitam se, gde je sada"

335
00:34:31,692 --> 00:34:34,612
Nestala...

336
00:35:07,395 --> 00:35:10,648
O voljena...

337
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:14,652
"dodji mom srcu,
O voljena"

338
00:35:16,195 --> 00:35:19,240
"Bio sam neznalica
po pitanju srca"

339
00:35:28,457 --> 00:35:31,669
"Ali ta devojka
me je izludela"

340
00:35:32,253 --> 00:35:36,257
"Svuda je trazim,
Pomislim vidim je..."

341
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:40,011
"To njeno lice, moje oci
vide neprestano"

342
00:35:41,053 --> 00:35:44,265
"Kakav nemir je ovo?
Zbog cega je ovo komesanje?"

343
00:35:45,182 --> 00:35:47,685
Nestala...

344
00:36:24,972 --> 00:36:28,309
"Vodite me toj devojci
nekako, prijatelji moji"

345
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:40,738
"Dajte mi svu srecu
sto sam izgubio"

346
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:44,742
"Pokazite mi gde zivi ona
i odrecicu se sopstvene kuce"

347
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:49,330
"Ako je sretnem sada,
Uzecu je samo za sebe"

348
00:36:49,914 --> 00:36:52,750
"Tada ce sve zudnje ovog jadnog momka
biti ispunjene?"

349
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:56,754
Nestala...

350
00:37:06,597 --> 00:37:10,351
"Ona je veoma lepa.
Ona stanuje negde ovde..."

351
00:37:10,518 --> 00:37:12,353
ali je nestala

352
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:18,776
"Ona je vila,
primamljiva, divna..."

353
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:21,779
Ona je nestala

354
00:37:23,531 --> 00:37:27,159
"Trazio sam je
svim svojim srcem i dusom..."

355
00:37:27,368 --> 00:37:31,372
"Trazio sam je svuda po svetu
the world, pitam se gde je sada"

356
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:34,792
Nestala...

357
00:38:02,278 --> 00:38:04,280
"20 dana ti si
me trazio?"

358
00:38:04,488 --> 00:38:07,074
"Svuda, jutrima i nocima.
Ali sam te nasao konacno"

359
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,411
Mogu li da te izvedem na veceru
i u voznju, posle toga?

360
00:38:11,412 --> 00:38:13,664
"Ne mogu da idem sa tobom, Raj.
- Zasto ne?"

361
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:16,000
Putujem u Atinu veceras.
- Atinu?

362
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,961
"Ucestvujes na Olimpijadi?
- Prestani da se salis, Raj"

363
00:38:19,295 --> 00:38:23,174
Moji me cekaju dole.
- Pa mi cemo pozvati i izviniti se

364
00:38:23,507 --> 00:38:26,093
Ni jedno izvinjenje nece znaciti.
Potrebno je ja da odem dole

365
00:38:26,427 --> 00:38:29,763
Sta to moze da bude da oni
bez tebe ne mogu da izvedu? Sta?

366
00:38:30,431 --> 00:38:32,600
"Moja veridba, Raj.
- Dobro, pa...?"

367
00:38:55,456 --> 00:38:58,709
A ja sam mislio da ti se
mozda svidjam

368
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,379
"Naravno da mi se svidjas, Raj.
I zato sam ovde"

369
00:39:02,713 --> 00:39:07,009
Pa sta onda sa veridbom
i svadbom? Zasto mi nisi rekla?

370
00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:10,471
Kako sam mogla? Sve je to odluceno
u poslednjoj nedelji

371
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:14,308
Poslednjoj nedelji?
- Da

372
00:39:14,683 --> 00:39:19,146
"Tata je pozvao da pita da li mogu da
se verim i, ja sam se slozila"

373
00:39:19,688 --> 00:39:24,652
I ti si se slozila da se udas za coveka
kojeg cak i ne poznajes

374
00:39:25,152 --> 00:39:28,489
Siguran sam da on nema cak ni
vozacku dozvolu za kamion

375
00:39:30,491 --> 00:39:34,328
"Sameer je prijatelj iz detinjstva, Raj.
IPoznajem ga dobro"

376
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,249
Kako mene treba kriviti sto se nismo
upoznali u nasem detinjstvu?

377
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,252
Ali upoznaj me sada.
Pogledaj koliko vredim

378
00:39:43,337 --> 00:39:47,508
Molim te daj mi jednu sansu.
Mozes odluciti bilo sta posle toga

379
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:52,846
"Raj, ne donosi samo jedan
odluke u zivotu"

380
00:39:53,263 --> 00:39:56,183
Niti iko sam vodi svoj zivot
na onaj nacin koji ti mislis

381
00:39:56,517 --> 00:39:59,853
"Postoji nesto sto se zove odanost.
Iz Londona, Pariza, Amerike..."

382
00:40:00,187 --> 00:40:02,189
moji rodjaci sa svih strana
sveta dolaze u Atinu

383
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:04,525
"U stvari, oni su vec verovatno
stigli tamo"

384
00:40:04,858 --> 00:40:06,860
"Veoma je vazno za mene
da odem tamo, Raj"

385
00:40:11,532 --> 00:40:13,534
A sta ce biti sa mnom?

386
00:40:15,536 --> 00:40:20,332
"Ti si veoma dobar momak, Raj.
Sigurno ces naci dobru devojku"

387
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:25,879
"Ja sam je nasao
ali ona govori o odlasku"

388
00:40:28,507 --> 00:40:29,550
U Atinu

389
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:48,819
"Raj, moram da idem sada"

390
00:40:53,574 --> 00:40:55,576
Mogu li negde da te odbacim?

391
00:40:59,455 --> 00:41:01,248
Vec si me odbacila

392
00:41:17,347 --> 00:41:21,894
"Moti, to se desilo
pre nego sto si se uopste i rodio"

393
00:41:23,604 --> 00:41:26,231
Ovde je ona zivela

394
00:41:27,357 --> 00:41:29,610
I ovde sam ja sedeo
svaki dan, da je gledam

395
00:41:30,611 --> 00:41:37,075
"U prozor, u vrata,
kako odlazi i dolazi"

396
00:41:39,536 --> 00:41:42,956
"I jednog dana, ona je otisla
sa nekim drugim"

397
00:41:45,626 --> 00:41:51,632
"To je bila moja greska.
Voleo bih, da sam joj rekao da je ja..."

398
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:54,635
mozda...

399
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:01,350
"Kada je odlazila, kao mlada,
svi su pevali..."

400
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:06,313
"Najhrabriji ce
odvesti mladu"

401
00:42:07,356 --> 00:42:09,149
I ja sa pevao sa njima

402
00:42:20,577 --> 00:42:24,122
Priya je ta koja ide u Grcku.
Zasto ti pakujes svoje torbe?

403
00:42:24,498 --> 00:42:26,458
Pakujem svoje torbe zato sto
i ja odlazim u Grcku takodje

404
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:29,336
Prestani da se raspravljas i pakuj mi torbu.
Baci se na to!

405
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:34,675
"To je Grcka, a ne predgradje gde
mozes da odes na tren"

406
00:42:35,384 --> 00:42:38,679
"Odlucio sam. Zbog Priye, ja cu
doseci bilo koji deo planete u trenu"

407
00:42:39,012 --> 00:42:41,515
"Rekao sam Viveku, da donese
moju vizu na aerodrom"

408
00:42:41,682 --> 00:42:44,518
Molim te spakuj ovo.
- U redu...

409
00:42:44,851 --> 00:42:47,604
ali zbog cega ti ides?
- Zbog cega? Priya treba da se veri!

410
00:42:47,938 --> 00:42:52,109
"I ti ides da prisustvujes?
- Priya jos uvek nije verena, okay?"

411
00:42:52,442 --> 00:42:54,444
Ne zelim da se raspravljam sa tobom.
Snajka...

412
00:42:54,695 --> 00:42:56,697
"ti vidis Nandua svaki dan, zar ne?
Pre mnogo godina..."

413
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:00,367
on nije zaustavio svoju devojku.
On sada sedi tamo sa flasom i psom...

414
00:43:00,701 --> 00:43:06,039
"i zali svaki dan,
Da sam samo jednom pokusao da je zaustavim"

415
00:43:06,456 --> 00:43:09,710
"Ne zelim da izgovorim,
"da sam samo" u zivotu"

416
00:43:10,711 --> 00:43:13,380
Daj mi moje kreditne kartice.
- Naravno...U fijoci su

417
00:43:13,714 --> 00:43:17,134
Ovo je moja poslednja sansa da osvojim Priyu.
- Zavrsices sa protracenim novcem i ustedjevinom

418
00:43:17,467 --> 00:43:19,469
Pricas kao Manubhai sada!

419
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:22,222
sta ce mi novac
ako Priya nije sa mnom?

420
00:43:22,556 --> 00:43:26,476
"Ne, to nije to. Udruzenje
vlasnika kamiona se sastaje sutra"

421
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:30,230
"Moras tamo da prisustvujes, ili ce ti
uskratiti pomoc"

422
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:34,025
"Nije to pomoc, vec subvencija.
- Dobro, i bice ti ukinuta"

423
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:36,403
Do djavola sa subvencijom!
- Kakva glupost!

424
00:43:36,737 --> 00:43:38,739
Zar je to nacin da se radi posao?

425
00:43:39,906 --> 00:43:42,075
"Manubhai, ne znam
kako se radi posao"

426
00:43:42,743 --> 00:43:44,745
Ali se ljubav, zasigurno, radi ovako

427
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:48,206
"Kako da ne, ljubav se radi ovako!
Cujes ti ovo?"

428
00:43:48,582 --> 00:43:50,417
Zar se ljubav ovako radi?

429
00:44:02,763 --> 00:44:05,223
"Ti?
- Da, I ja idem u Grcku"

430
00:44:05,557 --> 00:44:07,559
"Mislim, ja dolazim.
- Tako odjednom?"

431
00:44:08,769 --> 00:44:10,771
"Sta da radim, Priya?"

432
00:44:11,521 --> 00:44:15,108
"Ustvari, cuo sam ljubavnu pricu
kada sam bio decak"

433
00:44:15,525 --> 00:44:19,446
"Heroina ostavlja glavnog junaka,
i on odustaje i od nade"

434
00:44:19,779 --> 00:44:25,118
"Ceo svoj zivot, on misli da je trebao
bar da pokusa da je zaustavi"

435
00:44:25,452 --> 00:44:27,454
Mozda bi se stvari
odvile drugacije

436
00:44:28,788 --> 00:44:31,458
"Znam, ne dobijam sansu..."

437
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:35,170
ali ne zelim da zalim
ceo svoj zivot

438
00:44:35,504 --> 00:44:39,216
"Ja sam zelela da razumes, Raj...
- I ja sam razumeo, Priya. Ja jesam"

439
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:42,135
Ali moje srce to ne zeli

440
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:46,139
Sedi. Mi smo u istom
avionu sada

441
00:44:54,564 --> 00:44:58,151
Mi smo zajedno.
- Oa? Sto to mene treba da zanima?

442
00:44:58,818 --> 00:45:02,489
Pitao sam se ako bih mogao tu da sednem?
- Da sednes na mene?

443
00:45:02,822 --> 00:45:07,244
"Zasto bih seo na vas, ciko?
Mislim, Moje sediste je 3C"

444
00:45:07,577 --> 00:45:09,579
Vidite gde sedi ona teta?

445
00:45:10,205 --> 00:45:14,501
"Tamo? Necu da sedim tamo.
- Molim vas, ciko..."

446
00:45:14,834 --> 00:45:17,337
"Rekao sam ti, necu da sedim tamo.
Skloni se"

447
00:45:20,548 --> 00:45:22,550
Nisi jos otisao?
- Upravo idem

448
00:45:34,604 --> 00:45:37,691
"Ustvari, ja sam zeleo da sedim
sa onom devojkom tamo"

449
00:45:38,024 --> 00:45:40,860
Ona je drugarica.
- I sta ja treba da radim?

450
00:45:42,862 --> 00:45:46,866
Pitao sam se da li bi ste vi mogli da sednete
tamo, a da nju pozovem ovde...?

451
00:45:47,867 --> 00:45:50,537
Ja sam to ustvari pitao
onog gospodina

452
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:54,541
Ali se on nije slozio.
On je uzasno prgav covek!

453
00:45:54,874 --> 00:45:57,502
Znam. On je moj muz

454
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:05,260
"Trebalo je vas dvoje da sedite zajedno,
zar ne? Muz i zena?"

455
00:46:05,593 --> 00:46:07,887
"Mi smo u svadji vec
nedelju dana"

456
00:47:29,969 --> 00:47:31,805
To je strasno!

457
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:45,985
Imas li mobilni?

458
00:47:50,281 --> 00:47:55,328
"Tata, znas kako je lose
vreme u Atini"

459
00:47:57,747 --> 00:47:59,749
Let je odlozen
na osam sati

460
00:48:02,168 --> 00:48:04,337
"Molim te postaraj se da svi
razumeju, tata"

461
00:48:23,022 --> 00:48:27,026
"Onaj decak toliko dugo svira,
ali mu niko ne daje novac"

462
00:48:27,777 --> 00:48:29,529
Znas li zasto?
- Zasto?

463
00:48:29,904 --> 00:48:35,034
"Nema nista u njegovoj muzici,
njegovoj melodiji, njegovom talentu..."

464
00:48:36,035 --> 00:48:40,707
Dakle ti dobro poznajes muziku?
- Zar se ne secas Mahabaleshwar?

465
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,877
"U zemlju ljubavi,
podjimo...?"

466
00:48:45,878 --> 00:48:50,633
Znas li kako sam dobro pevao. I'll wakeBudicu te
pesmom svako jutro...

467
00:48:50,967 --> 00:48:55,221
i uspavljivacu te uspavankom.
Bicu tvoj hodajuci radio

468
00:49:10,903 --> 00:49:13,614
Kako ruzan pas! Kako zastrasujuce!

469
00:49:16,075 --> 00:49:19,078
Tacno tako. Bas slatko ruzan pas

470
00:49:22,332 --> 00:49:24,334
"Oh da, slatko ruzan"

471
00:49:25,793 --> 00:49:27,628
Svidja ti se?
- Da

472
00:49:28,087 --> 00:49:29,630
Zelis ga?
- Da

473
00:49:30,131 --> 00:49:31,966
Mogu li da ga osvojim za tebe?

474
00:49:58,367 --> 00:50:02,663
Odlicno ciljas.
Mozda su konzerve na pogresnom mestu?

475
00:50:02,997 --> 00:50:05,458
"Ne, ja sam samo vezbao.
Gledaj sad"

476
00:50:12,882 --> 00:50:14,634
Dobro smej se

477
00:50:16,135 --> 00:50:19,138
"Dok ti gadjas, ja odoh po sladoled.
- Sad cu ja"

478
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,476
"Ne mozes to da uspes, Raj.
- Naravno da mogu"

479
00:50:27,146 --> 00:50:29,148
"Raj, ne mozes!"

480
00:50:29,941 --> 00:50:33,778
"Raj, ne mozes"

481
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,493
Znam da mogu.
Sta sad da radim?

482
00:51:12,066 --> 00:51:13,526
Je l' to istina?
- Laz

483
00:51:13,901 --> 00:51:15,903
Pa kako si ga dobio?
- Cika mi ga je poklonio

484
00:51:16,279 --> 00:51:18,197
Tek tako?
- Ne tek tako

485
00:51:18,531 --> 00:51:21,742
Poklonio ga mi je kada je uvideo
koliko te volim

486
00:51:22,076 --> 00:51:24,120
Ali zalim...
- Sta se dogodilo?

487
00:51:24,453 --> 00:51:27,623
Stranac u vanzemaljskoj zemlji
razume moja osecanja

488
00:51:27,957 --> 00:51:30,543
"A ona koja treba,
ne razume"

489
00:51:31,043 --> 00:51:33,004
"Priya, I have decided.
- What?"

490
00:51:33,379 --> 00:51:35,673
"Kada se uzmemo, po jedan obrok
cu kuvati ja"

491
00:51:36,007 --> 00:51:38,384
Ja cu se starati oko dece takodje

492
00:51:46,976 --> 00:51:52,231
Znam po nesto o homeopatiji takodje.
Nikada neces patiti od kaslja i prehlade

493
00:51:52,565 --> 00:51:55,234
"Tvoja sitnija oboljenja,
Oteracu u trenu"

494
00:52:01,073 --> 00:52:03,034
"Ja sam mehanicar, zar ne?"

495
00:52:17,965 --> 00:52:19,967
"Zelja te zene
ce biti ispunjena, Raj!"

496
00:52:20,259 --> 00:52:22,928
"Smesno. Baci novcic u jezero,
pusti golog decaka da ga donese..."

497
00:52:23,262 --> 00:52:26,640
"i tvoja zelja ce biti ispunjena.
- Ljudi ovde veruju u to, Raj"

498
00:52:26,974 --> 00:52:29,518
Verujes li ti?
- Da. Imas li novcic?

499
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:34,273
"Imam novcic od provizije.
Nemoj da ga izgubis, okay?"

500
00:53:05,304 --> 00:53:07,139
"Pogledaj tamo, idiote"

501
00:53:59,525 --> 00:54:00,693
Nasao!

502
00:54:09,076 --> 00:54:12,079
Zasto si skocio u vodu?
- Da nadjem novcic

503
00:54:12,413 --> 00:54:15,040
Znam. Ali ko ti je trazio to?

504
00:54:15,457 --> 00:54:18,043
"Tvoje lice.
- Ne salim se, Raj"

505
00:54:18,377 --> 00:54:21,046
"Ni ja. Izraz tvog lica je rekao
"Raj, hajde skoci"

506
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,215
I Raj je skocio!

507
00:54:39,231 --> 00:54:40,858
"Lepa slika, zar ne?"

508
00:54:43,235 --> 00:54:46,864
Sta si pozelela
u bunaru zelja?

509
00:54:47,406 --> 00:54:50,409
Nista.
- Ma daj. Kazi mi

510
00:54:54,413 --> 00:54:57,583
Pozelela sam da stignem kuci na vreme

511
00:55:00,502 --> 00:55:02,588
To?
- Da

512
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:09,094
Znas li sta bih ja pozeleo?
- Znam

513
00:55:09,428 --> 00:55:12,014
"Ne, ovo je nova...
- Znam, Raj..."

514
00:55:12,348 --> 00:55:15,684
Poslusaj, jednom...
- Ne zelim

515
00:55:16,435 --> 00:55:17,645
Slusaj Priya...

516
00:55:21,273 --> 00:55:23,150
Ti nisi shvatila...

517
00:55:24,026 --> 00:55:25,944
koliko sam lud ljubavnik ja...

518
00:55:26,945 --> 00:55:31,283
"Ja sam ti doneo svoje srce
na poklon"

519
00:55:32,284 --> 00:55:36,455
Prici moga srca...

520
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:42,461
"Molim te slusaj,
saslusaj me..."

521
00:55:43,504 --> 00:55:48,217
"izaberi mene za svog
saputnika"

522
00:57:04,877 --> 00:57:06,712
Ti si tiha...

523
00:57:07,462 --> 00:57:09,548
i ja se pitam...

524
00:57:10,674 --> 00:57:16,180
"kako da ti kazem
tajnu"

525
00:57:18,557 --> 00:57:20,559
Mogao bih umreti za tebe...

526
00:57:21,393 --> 00:57:23,228
Istinu govorim...

527
00:57:24,062 --> 00:57:28,901
"trazi moj zivot,
ako zelis"

528
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:34,156
"Molim te slusaj,
Saslusaj me..."

529
00:57:35,574 --> 00:57:39,786
"izaberi mene za svog
saputnika"

530
00:58:23,914 --> 00:58:25,916
Ja sam usamljen...

531
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:29,127
I ti si usamljena

532
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:35,634
"Zamisli kako bi nam bilo,
da smo zajedno?"

533
00:58:37,969 --> 00:58:42,099
"Na svaki cilj, mi ludi ljubavnici..."

534
00:58:42,849 --> 00:58:47,646
podjimo karavanom nase ljubavi...

535
00:58:49,481 --> 00:58:53,652
"Molim te, slusaj,
saslusaj me..."

536
00:58:54,653 --> 00:58:59,074
"izaberi mene za svog
saputnika"

537
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:06,474
Ti nisi shvatila...

538
01:00:07,517 --> 01:00:09,519
koliko sam lud ljubavnik ja...

539
01:00:09,895 --> 01:00:14,441
"Ja sam ti doneo svoje
srce na poklon"

540
01:00:15,525 --> 01:00:20,739
Prici moga srca...

541
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:26,161
"Molim te slusaj,
saslusaj me..."

542
01:00:27,454 --> 01:00:31,750
"izaberi mene za svog
saputnika"

543
01:01:01,529 --> 01:01:05,450
"Ne brini, Priya.
Ja sam sve sredio"

544
01:01:05,784 --> 01:01:07,911
Iako je let odlozen na
narednih 12 sati...

545
01:01:08,286 --> 01:01:10,246
postoji jos nekoliko mesta
koja mi kos uvek nismo videli

546
01:01:10,622 --> 01:01:13,458
"Vidi, imam cak i mapu.
Nocni provod..."

547
01:01:14,793 --> 01:01:16,795
Veoma je potrebno da ja
stignem kuci

548
01:01:18,672 --> 01:01:20,423
Svi uveliko vec cekaju na mene

549
01:01:20,966 --> 01:01:24,803
Tata me je molio da stignem tamo
dan, dva ranije

550
01:01:25,762 --> 01:01:30,141
Sve je moja greska.
Ja sam sve odlozila

551
01:01:36,106 --> 01:01:37,816
"Ne placi, molim te"

552
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:40,819
"Ti moras da stignes u Atinu, tako?"

553
01:01:42,612 --> 01:01:44,406
Ja cu te odvesti u Atinu

554
01:01:46,574 --> 01:01:48,243
Samo nemoj plakati

555
01:01:58,712 --> 01:02:00,964
Ne jos. Cekaj prvo da te odvedem kuci

556
01:02:01,589 --> 01:02:03,591
U koje vreme moras da budes tamo?
- U jedanaest

557
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,846
Odvescu te tamo do 7:30. Hajde.
- Vozices celu noc?

558
01:02:09,681 --> 01:02:12,642
Zar se neces umoriti?
- Veoma

559
01:02:13,852 --> 01:02:17,856
"Ali posto te odvedem tamo,
Odmoricu se koliko treba"

560
01:02:19,858 --> 01:02:20,859
Idemo

561
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:33,264
Stigli smo?
- Da

562
01:03:33,932 --> 01:03:35,266
Kada?

563
01:03:37,644 --> 01:03:39,479
Pre cetrnaest minuta

564
01:03:41,105 --> 01:03:43,024
Zasto me nisi probudio?

565
01:03:44,984 --> 01:03:48,196
Hteo sam da te probudim.
Ali onda sam pomislio...

566
01:03:48,947 --> 01:03:51,950
"Ako te probudim, bices budna..."

567
01:03:52,742 --> 01:03:55,954
"i ako si budna,
otici ces"

568
01:03:58,081 --> 01:04:00,083
A ako bi otisla...

569
01:04:00,959 --> 01:04:03,294
kako bih mogao da te gledam
ovako izbliza?

570
01:04:05,797 --> 01:04:11,761
"Raj, mi smo proveli veoma malo vremena
zajedno. Ali bilo je predivno"

571
01:04:12,971 --> 01:04:15,306
Nemoj da govoris takve stvari
kada odlazis

572
01:04:21,688 --> 01:04:23,564
Iznecu tvoj prtljag

573
01:04:45,086 --> 01:04:48,089
Zadrzavas li moju jaknu?
- Ne

574
01:04:49,841 --> 01:04:53,344
Imam par stvarcica u njoj.
Vidi

575
01:04:55,013 --> 01:05:01,686
Our ulaznice iz Mumbaia.
Zadrzacu tvoje

576
01:05:02,937 --> 01:05:07,525
I karte iz Luna-parka.
Zadrzacu jednu

577
01:05:10,945 --> 01:05:14,031
Racun iz restorana.
I to cu zadrzati

578
01:05:16,909 --> 01:05:20,621
"ovaj novcic, ti zadrzi"

579
01:05:21,205 --> 01:05:23,249
Izvadio sam ga iz jezera za tebe

580
01:05:30,923 --> 01:05:32,383
Sve ovo...?

581
01:05:34,051 --> 01:05:36,053
Kada mi budes nedostajala...

582
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:38,681
Imacu sve ove sitnice

583
01:05:41,976 --> 01:05:43,728
I sada za ovu sliku

584
01:05:47,023 --> 01:05:49,233
Ti je zadrzi.
- Ne

585
01:05:51,903 --> 01:05:54,363
Treba da bude fer

586
01:05:58,075 --> 01:06:00,411
Ti zadrzi ovaj deo

587
01:06:06,834 --> 01:06:08,336
Priya seko

588
01:06:08,669 --> 01:06:10,087
"Didi, dodji!"

589
01:06:11,923 --> 01:06:13,633
"Vreme je da ides, zar ne?"

590
01:06:14,008 --> 01:06:16,427
"Ali ja moram da idem, Raj"

591
01:06:17,261 --> 01:06:18,596
Istina

592
01:06:25,102 --> 01:06:27,522
"Zamisli zelju, Priya.
- Sta?"

593
01:06:28,856 --> 01:06:30,608
Tek tako

594
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:36,531
"Da uvek budes srecna
u zivotu, Priya"

595
01:06:39,033 --> 01:06:43,120
"Da nikad ne moras da kazes,
"da sam samo" u svom zivotu..."

596
01:06:44,163 --> 01:06:46,249
kao sto je junak moje price govorio

597
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:54,548
Da uvek imas sce sto
ti sce pozeli

598
01:06:58,928 --> 01:07:02,807
"Zapamti, Priya. Postojace
covek u svetu, negde..."

599
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:05,142
koji ce biti veoma srecan...

600
01:07:09,146 --> 01:07:11,148
jer si ti srecna

601
01:07:13,901 --> 01:07:16,320
"To je to, to je sve"

602
01:07:26,163 --> 01:07:28,165
Ne zovi me unutra

603
01:07:30,209 --> 01:07:32,169
Necu biti u stanju da te odbijem

604
01:07:34,255 --> 01:07:36,257
Niti cu biti u stanju
da udjem

605
01:07:40,177 --> 01:07:44,015
"Hajde, Priya seko... Hajde!"

606
01:08:55,044 --> 01:08:57,046
Very fine. Congratulations
on your daughter's engagement

607
01:08:57,254 --> 01:08:59,089
"Thank you.
- Where's she, by the way?"

608
01:08:59,256 --> 01:09:01,592
Where is she?
- She'll be here any moment

609
01:09:07,598 --> 01:09:09,600
She's not ready yet?
- She's a girl

610
01:09:10,267 --> 01:09:12,269
It takes time for them
to get ready

611
01:09:18,108 --> 01:09:20,069
"I know I don't
stand a chance, Priya"

612
01:09:20,277 --> 01:09:22,279
"But I don't want to say
If only all my life"

613
01:09:22,696 --> 01:09:26,450
"I tried to make you see reason, Raj...
- I see reason, Priya. I see it"

614
01:09:27,117 --> 01:09:29,286
But my heart won't

615
01:09:32,122 --> 01:09:34,124
"A stranger in an alien land
understands my feelings..."

616
01:09:35,417 --> 01:09:38,087
"but the one who must understand,
won't understand"

617
01:09:38,462 --> 01:09:40,714
"Priya, I have decided.
- What?"

618
01:09:41,131 --> 01:09:43,092
"After our marriage,
I'll cook one meal for us"

619
01:09:43,467 --> 01:09:46,303
I'll look after the kids too

620
01:10:04,154 --> 01:10:07,908
"Remember, there will be someone
happy somewhere in the world..."

621
01:10:08,909 --> 01:10:10,744
because you are happy

622
01:10:41,358 --> 01:10:44,695
"Papa, I have something
to tell you"

623
01:11:24,401 --> 01:11:26,403
"What is happening, grandma?"

624
01:11:28,155 --> 01:11:30,574
Why have you to think so much?

625
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,410
"You're not going to
do as she says, will you?"

626
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:39,041
Priya's marrying Sameer
and Sameer alone

627
01:11:40,167 --> 01:11:42,795
"Auntie, Priya won't be
happy with the marriage"

628
01:11:43,128 --> 01:11:46,298
And I understand that pretty well.
- But Sameer...

629
01:11:46,632 --> 01:11:52,638
"No, I don't want our marriage
to be based on a compromise"

630
01:11:57,226 --> 01:11:59,603
"Sameer, I came here
for the engagement"

631
01:12:00,437 --> 01:12:04,441
But how was I to know that
all this would happen on the way?

632
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,242
"I understand, Priya.
- You understand nothing, Sameer"

633
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:17,621
And why are you quiet?
You are the bride's father

634
01:12:18,205 --> 01:12:19,623
Say something

635
01:12:27,256 --> 01:12:32,469
"My child, are you sure he's a nice
boy and that he'll keep you happy?"

636
01:12:34,346 --> 01:12:36,473
Yes.
- Why don't you meet him?

637
01:12:37,015 --> 01:12:40,310
What's gotten into all of you?
You even want to meet him now?

638
01:12:41,353 --> 01:12:44,147
What's wrong in meeting him?
- He must be in the plane by now.

639
01:12:44,481 --> 01:12:46,483
He left four hours ago

640
01:12:47,442 --> 01:12:50,112
"No, aunt. He mustn't have gone away"

641
01:12:51,321 --> 01:12:56,285
"Papa, if I know him well,
he must still be waiting for me"

642
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:05,711
May I and stop Raj? Please?

643
01:15:11,878 --> 01:15:13,964
"Yours must be the first step
in our house, Priya"

644
01:15:17,425 --> 01:15:19,177
What happened?
- One second

645
01:15:19,553 --> 01:15:21,221
I'll go in for a while

646
01:15:22,305 --> 01:15:24,224
Something important to do...
I'll be back soon

647
01:15:24,516 --> 01:15:27,477
"Don't worry. I'll take you in.
I've married you, after all"

648
01:15:27,811 --> 01:15:29,146
One minute

649
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:46,663
"I'm coming in, Raj.
- Wait..."

650
01:15:51,501 --> 01:15:53,920
Let no one say that we didn't
complete the rituals

651
01:15:54,671 --> 01:15:57,674
"It's actually meant to be done
by my mother, but right now..."

652
01:16:12,439 --> 01:16:13,690
Red ink

653
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:16,234
Let me do it

654
01:16:26,536 --> 01:16:28,496
This is also meant to be done
by someone elderly...

655
01:16:28,705 --> 01:16:31,041
"but since I'm doing everything,
this one too..."

656
01:16:33,877 --> 01:16:39,799
Now for this ritual.
I don't know who performs it...

657
01:16:40,467 --> 01:16:42,844
but it's performed all right.
I know that

658
01:16:47,724 --> 01:16:49,559
May I come over?
- Please

659
01:16:49,893 --> 01:16:52,395
But mind your step.
Don't slip on the talcum powder

660
01:17:21,633 --> 01:17:24,886
"Priya, this is our house"

661
01:17:41,611 --> 01:17:42,779
It's nice

662
01:17:49,702 --> 01:17:51,371
"You're already up, Raj?"

663
01:17:52,539 --> 01:17:54,416
I didn't go to sleep all night

664
01:17:54,749 --> 01:17:57,460
And I never got better sleep
than this

665
01:17:59,587 --> 01:18:03,800
"What are you wearing, Raj?
- This is Allah Mian"

666
01:18:04,551 --> 01:18:06,219
Allah Mian?
- God

667
01:18:06,553 --> 01:18:08,972
You know Salim?
His mother gave it to me

668
01:18:09,556 --> 01:18:15,937
"Know what? Whatever I ask Him for,
He gives it to me"

669
01:18:16,938 --> 01:18:18,940
Like you. I have you

670
01:18:20,567 --> 01:18:24,821
"You always carry Him with you?
- Yes, He's always with me"

671
01:18:27,615 --> 01:18:30,618
I feel incomplete without Him

672
01:18:32,579 --> 01:18:34,372
Won't you even give Him to me?

673
01:18:37,834 --> 01:18:39,169
One moment

674
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:48,178
"God, if something
ever happens to me..."

675
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:51,347
if I'm no more...

676
01:18:52,849 --> 01:18:54,851
do look after my Priya

677
01:18:55,810 --> 01:18:58,188
Because even she doesn't know
how much I love her

678
01:18:59,856 --> 01:19:04,861
I love Priya very very much

679
01:19:11,951 --> 01:19:15,163
We'll always remain together Raj

680
01:19:31,721 --> 01:19:35,099
I didn't find a love story
like this even in fairytales

681
01:19:38,978 --> 01:19:41,898
"Sorry guys, I'm late.
I'm sick of this traffic"

682
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:45,902
"I told you, you're never on time.
And they..."

683
01:19:51,741 --> 01:19:54,452
"Salim, this is my fiancee Sheetal"

684
01:19:55,745 --> 01:19:58,706
"This is Salim and that
is his wife, Farah"

685
01:19:59,415 --> 01:20:02,585
We got stuck in the traffic...
- I told him

686
01:20:02,919 --> 01:20:06,589
"No, it isn't about that. Actually,
while waiting for you..."

687
01:20:06,923 --> 01:20:09,592
I heard a wonderful love story.
- Which one?

688
01:20:09,926 --> 01:20:11,928
Raj and Priya's love-story

689
01:20:16,933 --> 01:20:19,602
I'd like to meet
Raj and Priya some day

690
01:20:19,936 --> 01:20:21,479
Oh certainly

691
01:20:21,813 --> 01:20:24,816
"You're very lucky, Sheetal.
- How come?"

692
01:20:25,191 --> 01:20:29,737
Because today is the first wedding
anniversary of Raj and Priya!

693
01:20:35,702 --> 01:20:37,954
It's their surprise party
we're going to today

694
01:20:40,373 --> 01:20:43,376
Sonofagun! Couldn't you tell me
that over the phone?

695
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:46,379
"If I told you, the surprise
wouldn't be a surprise anymore"

696
01:20:46,713 --> 01:20:49,173
"Let's go, we're getting late.
- But where is the party?"

697
01:20:49,507 --> 01:20:52,468
On the terrace of their building.
C'mon

698
01:20:54,971 --> 01:20:56,264
"Come, come..."

699
01:20:57,765 --> 01:21:02,353
"Manubhai, why have you brought us here?
- Don't ask, just see what I've done"

700
01:21:02,687 --> 01:21:05,314
Now look...
- What will I look at in the darkness?

701
01:21:06,691 --> 01:21:08,317
What's here anyway?

702
01:21:17,994 --> 01:21:19,996
"I'm Sheetal, Deepak's fiance!"

703
01:21:22,123 --> 01:21:25,376
"When they told me about your
love story, I couldn't believe..."

704
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:28,337
that someone could have a romance
like yours in our times!

705
01:21:36,012 --> 01:21:38,806
"Manubhai, this surprise party
is great fun!"

706
01:21:48,024 --> 01:21:49,817
"Quiet, quiet!"

707
01:21:50,651 --> 01:21:52,695
"For two hours, this is what
we were talking about..."

708
01:21:53,029 --> 01:21:56,741
"and you want to fight even here!
- Not me, Raj. You want to fight"

709
01:21:57,033 --> 01:22:00,453
Priya! You've changed so much
in the past one year

710
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:03,497
You are the one who has changed?
- Have I?

711
01:22:03,873 --> 01:22:06,042
You're fighting with me
on our first wedding anniversary...

712
01:22:06,375 --> 01:22:08,711
and you say I've changed?
- Do you think I like fighting...

713
01:22:09,045 --> 01:22:13,216
with you on our first anniversary?
But you're not the man I got married to!

714
01:22:15,843 --> 01:22:17,762
You married the wrong man!

715
01:22:18,054 --> 01:22:20,056
Just leave me then!

716
01:22:29,815 --> 01:22:31,817
At least sweeten
each other's tongue first

717
01:22:37,823 --> 01:22:39,867
Your turn. Come on!

718
01:23:07,645 --> 01:23:09,897
Looks like the lady isn't
in a nice mood this morning

719
01:23:10,439 --> 01:23:13,025
You were even late in coming.
Is everything all right?

720
01:23:13,442 --> 01:23:16,153
I didn't sleep well last night.
- No? That's nice

721
01:23:16,487 --> 01:23:18,614
Were you thinking about me?
- No

722
01:23:19,657 --> 01:23:22,076
I was thinking what a huge
nuisance marriage is

723
01:23:22,451 --> 01:23:24,412
What does it mean?
- Problem if you marry...

724
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:27,081
problem if you don't.
- What makes you say that?

725
01:23:27,415 --> 01:23:30,292
Look at Raj and Priya. It was
supposed to be a great love affair

726
01:23:30,626 --> 01:23:32,753
"But what happened?
- Yes, what happened?"

727
01:23:33,462 --> 01:23:36,257
Hold on... are you talking
about last night?

728
01:23:38,634 --> 01:23:41,095
Every man and wife have
their share of problems

729
01:23:41,470 --> 01:23:43,431
That doesn't mean they aren't
happy with each other

730
01:23:43,681 --> 01:23:46,434
I know Raj.
He loves Priya very much

731
01:23:46,809 --> 01:23:49,478
Loving your wife doesn't
make you a very nice husband

732
01:23:49,812 --> 01:23:53,441
"Really? The way you talk, it seems as
if you've done a Phd on marriages"

733
01:23:53,816 --> 01:23:55,109
What?
- You haven't said this...

734
01:23:55,317 --> 01:23:57,111
"to anyone else, have you?
- No"

735
01:23:57,445 --> 01:24:01,073
And please don't!
People will laugh at you

736
01:24:01,449 --> 01:24:04,076
Raj and Priya love
each other very much

737
01:24:20,301 --> 01:24:24,013
Raj is always late. He knows
Priya doesn't like it at all

738
01:24:34,315 --> 01:24:37,359
Your son-in-law hasn't arrived yet?
- What can I do?

739
01:24:37,693 --> 01:24:41,363
I asked him before holding a ritual
for their peaceful future

740
01:24:41,697 --> 01:24:45,826
But the boys nowadays...!
- Praise the Lord!

741
01:24:49,497 --> 01:24:51,332
His phone's not working

742
01:24:55,503 --> 01:24:58,005
See your friend?
He's still missing

743
01:24:58,464 --> 01:25:01,967
"He's late, but I'm sure
he'll come"

744
01:25:06,722 --> 01:25:11,518
"My child, the ritual is over
and your husband hasn't arrived?"

745
01:25:11,894 --> 01:25:15,189
He has already left the office.
He should be here any moment

746
01:25:15,522 --> 01:25:18,525
It was necessary for both of you
to be present at this ritual

747
01:25:19,735 --> 01:25:21,904
The auspicious hour has
passed already

748
01:25:22,529 --> 01:25:25,032
We can't wait anymore

749
01:25:29,745 --> 01:25:32,331
All right. You may do
as you think fit

750
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:39,505
We will now pray to God
to bless you both

751
01:25:50,683 --> 01:25:55,145
This spinach looks delicious.
And the chickpeas smell great

752
01:25:55,479 --> 01:25:58,232
Nobody makes chickpea
like you do... enough

753
01:25:59,692 --> 01:26:01,443
Sit... down

754
01:26:03,779 --> 01:26:07,992
"How will this do, Priya?
I've said sorry, sought forgiveness"

755
01:26:08,492 --> 01:26:10,577
It's all over...
at least talk to me now

756
01:26:10,828 --> 01:26:13,789
How will it do if you don't talk?

757
01:26:16,834 --> 01:26:21,088
"All right. If you're not eating
with me, I'm not eating too"

758
01:26:25,801 --> 01:26:30,264
"Priya, talk to me! I told you,
I made a mistake. I'm sorry!"

759
01:26:30,597 --> 01:26:33,809
"You say sorry, but how about the
ritual aunt Anna held for us?"

760
01:26:34,143 --> 01:26:36,145
Do you realise how
insulted I felt?

761
01:26:38,814 --> 01:26:42,609
I was coming any way.
But Mr Malhotra showed up

762
01:26:42,943 --> 01:26:45,487
And you know how important
Mr Malhotra is for our business

763
01:26:45,821 --> 01:26:47,823
I know how important
your business is!

764
01:26:48,157 --> 01:26:50,909
Where was your business when you
followed me all the way to Greece?

765
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:54,913
It had to do with love then.
- With love?

766
01:26:55,247 --> 01:26:57,541
So where is your love now?
- But we're already married

767
01:26:57,833 --> 01:27:00,043
"What does that mean, Raj?"

768
01:27:01,837 --> 01:27:05,132
Just that one marries
the one he loves

769
01:27:05,466 --> 01:27:07,426
"And love is always there,
or why would the marriage be?"

770
01:27:07,634 --> 01:27:10,262
"I mean, love goes in a bit of a
background after marriage..."

771
01:27:10,596 --> 01:27:13,849
"You're in love, I'm in love...
we're loved ones"

772
01:27:15,851 --> 01:27:17,853
Shit! What am I saying!

773
01:27:19,563 --> 01:27:22,524
"Priya, listen to me.
That wasn't what I meant to say"

774
01:27:22,858 --> 01:27:24,526
I was confused

775
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:27,696
"What I meant to say is that after
marriage, one becomes responsible"

776
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:31,366
So you say you're responsible?
- Hundred per cent responsible!

777
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,619
"You're hundred per cent
responsible, right?"

778
01:27:33,869 --> 01:27:37,664
"This is your shirt, isn't it? But you
took it off and kept it on the sofa"

779
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:40,584
"If you wished, you could also keep
it with the laundry, couldn't you?"

780
01:27:40,876 --> 01:27:43,212
But you won't.
And your shoes always...

781
01:27:44,046 --> 01:27:45,214
Which shoes?

782
01:27:48,675 --> 01:27:50,677
"What?
- You just picked them up, didn't you?"

783
01:27:51,762 --> 01:27:55,307
"You just picked them up, didn't you?
- All right, but I picked them up"

784
01:27:55,641 --> 01:27:58,018
Why wouldn't you do it earlier?

785
01:28:01,605 --> 01:28:05,234
"All right, I won't smile! But let's
decide what you're complaining about!"

786
01:28:05,567 --> 01:28:08,570
"That I'm late, I didn't get to the
temple, my shoes, my smile...?"

787
01:28:08,904 --> 01:28:11,698
What is it that you complain about?
- I complain about everything you do!

788
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:14,576
"Everything?
- There's a way of living together, Raj"

789
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:17,329
Now hold on! You're going to
teach me to live together?

790
01:28:17,663 --> 01:28:19,581
The large-hearted one...

791
01:28:19,957 --> 01:28:25,003
Shut up! What silly song is that!
We're have a fight going here!

792
01:28:31,718 --> 01:28:34,596
I'm no kid for you to...

793
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:35,931
Shut up!

794
01:28:37,099 --> 01:28:39,601
"So stop lecturing me, please"

795
01:28:39,935 --> 01:28:42,271
"It's not wrong to point
someone's mistakes, Raj"

796
01:28:43,897 --> 01:28:44,940
Mistakes...?

797
01:28:48,944 --> 01:28:52,114
"You say mistakes, Priya. But it's
not always my mistake"

798
01:28:52,447 --> 01:28:55,200
You make mistakes several times
and I still say sorry

799
01:28:55,534 --> 01:28:59,746
So you're saying you're perfect?
- Did I say that...?

800
01:29:01,832 --> 01:29:05,627
"I'm not perfect, Priya. You...
you think Nandu's perfect?"

801
01:29:05,961 --> 01:29:08,964
He's not.
None of us is perfect

802
01:29:11,758 --> 01:29:14,344
I come back home after
a hard day's work...

803
01:29:14,678 --> 01:29:17,097
I feel like sitting down
and chatting with you...

804
01:29:17,764 --> 01:29:21,977
or the two of us having
a cup of coffee in the balcony

805
01:29:26,898 --> 01:29:29,985
You want romance?
And chat with me?

806
01:29:30,736 --> 01:29:32,404
With the tv on?

807
01:29:34,990 --> 01:29:38,410
"I switched on the tv because...
- That's your daily routine, Raj"

808
01:29:38,744 --> 01:29:41,455
You come home every day
and sit down before the tv

809
01:29:41,788 --> 01:29:44,458
I too want you to talk to me
when you come back home

810
01:29:44,791 --> 01:29:46,460
But you'll never understand...

811
01:29:48,003 --> 01:29:51,840
I've switched off the tv.
So let's talk. Please. Come on

812
01:29:52,174 --> 01:29:55,135
What did you do in the office today?
- Let's not talk about the office

813
01:29:55,719 --> 01:29:58,346
Because I'm sick of office-talk
while I'm in the office

814
01:29:58,805 --> 01:30:01,475
"When I come back home, I feel like
talking about something else"

815
01:30:01,808 --> 01:30:04,436
But you talk of nothing else Raj.
You begin to watch tv!

816
01:30:04,811 --> 01:30:07,230
"But I only catch up with the news!
- News, Cricket match and...!"

817
01:30:08,023 --> 01:30:11,485
"You're right and I'm wrong, okay?
- No, you're not wrong"

818
01:30:11,818 --> 01:30:16,698
"I'm wrong! And I'm sorry!
- Please, Raj! Stop saying sorry"

819
01:30:17,032 --> 01:30:19,701
And I'm not going to forget
today's insult ever

820
01:30:20,035 --> 01:30:23,038
What insult?
And I can't even say sorry!

821
01:30:23,789 --> 01:30:25,791
I want to sleep.
- So sleep

822
01:30:26,041 --> 01:30:28,043
Have your food and switch
off the lights

823
01:30:28,168 --> 01:30:30,712
Why must I eat? You took away
my plate! And the lights...?

824
01:30:31,046 --> 01:30:33,715
Why must you have everything your way?
The lights are not being switched off!

825
01:30:34,049 --> 01:30:37,052
Let me see who switches them off!
- All right. Let the lights remain

826
01:30:52,067 --> 01:30:54,653
"Milkman, can't you come
a bit early?"

827
01:30:55,070 --> 01:30:58,490
My husband's been pestering
me for tea all morning!

828
01:30:58,824 --> 01:31:01,535
"But I can come only when the
Buffalo starts milking, right?"

829
01:31:01,868 --> 01:31:04,746
You have a new excuse every day.
If you don't come on time tomorrow...

830
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:08,750
I'll stop your supply and
take milk from the dairy instead

831
01:31:09,084 --> 01:31:10,919
You get that?
- All right

832
01:31:14,798 --> 01:31:16,633
Milk for 2 rupees

833
01:31:18,093 --> 01:31:21,680
"Nandu, have you given up booze
and started drinking milk instead?"

834
01:31:22,013 --> 01:31:26,768
Not for me. It's for Moti.
Can't you see how skinny he's become?

835
01:31:27,102 --> 01:31:28,436
Smell him

836
01:31:29,771 --> 01:31:34,234
He's in bad shape.
He needs calcium

837
01:31:42,284 --> 01:31:44,077
"Your juice, Raj"

838
01:31:44,119 --> 01:31:46,454
Breakfast is lying on the table.
Have it before you leave

839
01:31:47,122 --> 01:31:49,416
There's no saying when
you'll have lunch anyway

840
01:31:51,042 --> 01:31:53,628
"I just scrubbed the floor, Raj.
What are you doing?"

841
01:31:54,087 --> 01:31:56,798
What?
- You've wet the pillow

842
01:31:57,132 --> 01:31:59,676
It's my pillow.
I use it

843
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,636
And... all right

844
01:32:05,724 --> 01:32:07,309
Is it okay now?

845
01:32:10,937 --> 01:32:13,440
"What's that now?
- You'll wet the bedsheet, Raj"

846
01:32:14,107 --> 01:32:17,152
What arguments do we get
caught up in every morning?

847
01:32:17,444 --> 01:32:19,821
"I haven't started the argument, Raj.
- The way you..."

848
01:32:20,155 --> 01:32:22,282
how will I do any work at
the office in this mood?

849
01:32:22,657 --> 01:32:24,659
Your mood gets spoilt
every now and then

850
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:27,954
"But naturally, Priya!
It's because of what you say!"

851
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:31,333
You tell me how to go about
every little thing

852
01:32:31,666 --> 01:32:34,836
"This isn't right. Don't keep
the shoe here, someone might trip"

853
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:39,424
Must I keep the shoes on my head?
How's anyone going to trip on shoes?

854
01:32:39,883 --> 01:32:41,968
Do you fall over this ironing board
which is lying here?

855
01:32:42,302 --> 01:32:44,596
Do you fall over the bed?
But you'll trip over the shoes

856
01:32:44,929 --> 01:32:47,849
"You're always picking on my shoes!
- What wrong have I said, Raj?"

857
01:32:48,183 --> 01:32:50,185
"I just want some cleanliness
to be maintained, isn't it?"

858
01:32:50,518 --> 01:32:53,521
"What's wrong if our house is clean?
- It's wrong, very wrong!"

859
01:32:54,189 --> 01:32:56,274
I like to have my room littered

860
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:59,861
"I want one of my shoes to lie here,
and one to lie there"

861
01:33:00,195 --> 01:33:01,988
I want to see who
trips over them!

862
01:33:02,197 --> 01:33:05,325
It's because I'm illiterate!
I'm a bloody bum!

863
01:33:05,742 --> 01:33:09,329
"I like to have my pillow
at my feet, not my head"

864
01:33:09,704 --> 01:33:12,540
And these blankets mustn't be
on the bed when I'm about to sleep

865
01:33:12,916 --> 01:33:16,002
"And this towel, wherever I take it off
is the right place"

866
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:20,673
"I agree, I don't know how to live.
I don't know it at all"

867
01:33:21,007 --> 01:33:23,551
Only you know it!
And what can I do?

868
01:33:23,927 --> 01:33:25,929
I got married for the first time!

869
01:33:28,014 --> 01:33:29,974
"It's my first marriage too, Raj"

870
01:33:31,101 --> 01:33:33,353
And throw away that bedsheet too

871
01:34:25,071 --> 01:34:26,739
"What are you doing, Priya?"

872
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:30,785
People are watching!

873
01:35:14,287 --> 01:35:17,915
"Goodness!
The signs you make..."

874
01:35:19,334 --> 01:35:23,004
they make me crazy about you

875
01:35:24,881 --> 01:35:29,344
What secrets are you exposing...

876
01:35:30,094 --> 01:35:34,557
"what are you telling me
with your eyes?"

877
01:35:35,099 --> 01:35:38,353
You do wield all the magic

878
01:35:39,479 --> 01:35:43,358
"Goodness!
The signs you make..."

879
01:35:44,609 --> 01:35:48,529
they make me crazy about you

880
01:35:50,156 --> 01:35:54,911
"You are the one who
touches my heartstrings"

881
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:59,832
Why would anyone meeting you...

882
01:36:00,208 --> 01:36:03,669
not lose her heart to you

883
01:36:30,696 --> 01:36:35,034
"Your lush body,
casts a spell"

884
01:36:35,493 --> 01:36:39,997
"Your dense tresses
exude a fragrance"

885
01:36:40,498 --> 01:36:45,128
"On my breath
lingers a scent..."

886
01:36:45,628 --> 01:36:49,841
"because your eyes
are going astray"

887
01:36:50,216 --> 01:36:55,096
"Your body is as beautiful
as the rosegardens..."

888
01:36:55,763 --> 01:36:59,058
"the sight of it
drives me out of my senses"

889
01:37:00,309 --> 01:37:04,438
"Goodness!
The signs you make..."

890
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:38,264
"An intoxication
is taking over..."

891
01:37:38,723 --> 01:37:43,060
I'm barely in my senses

892
01:37:43,477 --> 01:37:47,982
I'm lost to myself too...

893
01:37:48,482 --> 01:37:52,820
"I awake
but I feel as if I'm asleep"

894
01:37:53,154 --> 01:37:58,117
"Keep swaying,
keep melting..."

895
01:37:58,576 --> 01:38:02,038
when you are in my arms

896
01:38:03,331 --> 01:38:07,293
"Goodness!
The signs you make..."

897
01:38:08,294 --> 01:38:12,298
they make me crazy about you

898
01:38:13,633 --> 01:38:18,512
"You are the one who
touches my heartstrings"

899
01:38:19,221 --> 01:38:23,643
Why would anyone meeting you...

900
01:38:23,976 --> 01:38:27,521
not lose her heart to you

901
01:38:28,648 --> 01:38:32,318
"Goodness!
The signs you make..."

902
01:38:33,361 --> 01:38:37,531
they make me crazy about you

903
01:38:39,283 --> 01:38:43,746
What secrets are you exposing...

904
01:38:44,497 --> 01:38:48,918
"what are you telling me
with your eyes?"

905
01:38:49,335 --> 01:38:52,797
You do wield all the magic

906
01:39:29,333 --> 01:39:31,585
Take care of this small car.
It might get lost

907
01:39:34,296 --> 01:39:36,924
Let me tell you again. Whenever
I go to your high society parties...

908
01:39:37,258 --> 01:39:41,053
it ruins my mood. Like my small car
here among big ones...

909
01:39:41,387 --> 01:39:43,973
I will also feel awkward...
small and out of place

910
01:39:44,306 --> 01:39:46,308
"Not again, Raj! Sameer has
invited us with such a lot of love"

911
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:50,020
"I know, so you can go ahead. I'll go
to Irfan's garage in the neighbourhood"

912
01:39:50,354 --> 01:39:52,356
"Give me a call when the party is
over, I'll come and collect you"

913
01:39:52,606 --> 01:39:55,151
"Raj, does it look nice for me to
go parties alone after my marriage?"

914
01:39:55,484 --> 01:39:59,405
"You're not alone, it's your family,
your friends. What would I do...?"

915
01:40:01,407 --> 01:40:03,284
"Okay, I'm going with you"

916
01:40:13,627 --> 01:40:17,631
"Wow! You look extra beautiful
in that sari! What say, Raj?"

917
01:40:21,343 --> 01:40:23,345
You remember we went to Athens
during our vacations?

918
01:40:26,348 --> 01:40:28,642
"Of course, I remember. Know what, Raj?
There was a lovely lake by the house"

919
01:40:28,976 --> 01:40:31,520
In which Sameer and I went
boating all day

920
01:40:31,854 --> 01:40:36,775
"Remember, Sameer? We insisted with our
parents that we wanted that very house?"

921
01:40:37,276 --> 01:40:41,280
I remember. And I've
fulfilled the condition

922
01:40:41,655 --> 01:40:44,158
"You mean, you...?
- I've bought the house"

923
01:40:47,661 --> 01:40:50,456
You must see that house.
It was beautiful

924
01:40:52,458 --> 01:40:54,543
Why don't you take Raj there
for a holiday?

925
01:40:54,877 --> 01:40:56,879
Lt'll be a break
even for you Raj

926
01:41:11,393 --> 01:41:15,564
You talk about this? How about
the Versace suit you're wearing?

927
01:41:20,444 --> 01:41:23,948
The girl who marries you
is going to be really lucky

928
01:41:32,498 --> 01:41:34,500
What are you guys playing
the boring couple for?

929
01:41:39,505 --> 01:41:41,715
"Must I ask for permission?
Please let me, sir!"

930
01:42:10,744 --> 01:42:14,248
"How's my suit?
- It's nice, sir"

931
01:42:14,748 --> 01:42:16,875
I got it stitched during my wedding

932
01:42:19,753 --> 01:42:22,965
"How about my watch?
- It's nice too, sir"

933
01:42:40,858 --> 01:42:43,152
"Ramji, tell me what price
you're selling ladyfinger for"

934
01:42:43,485 --> 01:42:46,655
10 rupees for a quarter kilo.
- You think we're industrialists?

935
01:42:51,452 --> 01:42:54,455
I hope you liked it Rustom Uncle?
- I loved it

936
01:42:54,788 --> 01:42:56,790
"Your biscuits were nice
too, sister-in-law"

937
01:42:56,957 --> 01:42:59,460
"They were from my shop.
- This is for you, Radha"

938
01:42:59,793 --> 01:43:02,588
Aunt! What a pleasant surprise!

939
01:43:03,505 --> 01:43:05,799
"Do come again, okay?
- Very well. Good bye"

940
01:43:12,806 --> 01:43:14,391
Aunt!

941
01:43:16,810 --> 01:43:19,354
"Tell me what you'll have.
Tea, coffee...?"

942
01:43:19,688 --> 01:43:21,231
I don't want anything

943
01:43:21,607 --> 01:43:24,109
Do these people come
even to your house?

944
01:43:24,693 --> 01:43:27,613
They hadn't seen me in a
long time and came over...

945
01:43:27,946 --> 01:43:31,491
to ask about my well-being.
But tell me how you have been!

946
01:43:31,825 --> 01:43:34,244
"I'm all right.
- Hello, sister-in-law"

947
01:43:34,578 --> 01:43:36,580
How many eggs?
- 6. Keep them in the refrigerator

948
01:43:38,832 --> 01:43:42,502
"Be careful, don't break the eggs.
- Very well, sister-in-law"

949
01:43:43,128 --> 01:43:47,633
"What's happening here, Priya?
Vegetable sellers and egg sellers!"

950
01:43:47,966 --> 01:43:49,968
Are these the only people left
in your life?

951
01:43:50,761 --> 01:43:53,555
"Hello, Lady. Your clothes.
- You got my sari, Ganpat?"

952
01:43:53,889 --> 01:43:56,308
Of course.
- All right. Keep it here

953
01:43:56,642 --> 01:43:58,602
I'll take it in later.
- Very well. Good bye

954
01:43:58,852 --> 01:43:59,853
Good bye

955
01:44:00,437 --> 01:44:03,523
Priya! You even know
your laundryman's name?

956
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,609
"Yes, aunt"

957
01:44:05,984 --> 01:44:08,487
What kind of a life
are you leading?

958
01:44:08,862 --> 01:44:13,492
What have you come to?
And I had such dreams for you

959
01:44:13,867 --> 01:44:17,329
"There's nothing of the sort, aunt.
I'm very happy here"

960
01:44:17,663 --> 01:44:19,665
I'm starting my work
all over again and...

961
01:44:19,873 --> 01:44:23,669
"Raj is landing a new contract too.
- What new contract, Priya"

962
01:44:24,002 --> 01:44:27,923
"I've been hearing that for ages!
Anyway, I've made up my mind"

963
01:44:28,298 --> 01:44:30,550
I've brought you
two tickets to Greece

964
01:44:30,884 --> 01:44:32,886
Go and have a holiday

965
01:44:33,637 --> 01:44:37,015
"But how can I accept it, aunt?
I'm already married"

966
01:44:37,349 --> 01:44:40,227
Why can't you accept it?
I'm like your mother

967
01:44:40,644 --> 01:44:44,356
And a mother can give her daughter
anything and any amount she wants to

968
01:44:44,690 --> 01:44:47,109
You get that? It's her right

969
01:44:51,697 --> 01:44:56,910
"The large-hearted one
will leave with the bride..."

970
01:44:58,954 --> 01:45:02,708
"Raj doesn't like my song and...
- No, Nandu. Go ahead and sing"

971
01:45:03,041 --> 01:45:07,921
Can I? Even in the night?
- You may sing all night

972
01:45:09,631 --> 01:45:12,592
So I'm going to sing
for Raj tonight!

973
01:45:12,926 --> 01:45:17,264
"Raj, you sing so well too.
Join me in the nights"

974
01:45:17,723 --> 01:45:21,351
"I'm all alone.
- Some other time, Nandu"

975
01:45:21,685 --> 01:45:23,687
"Tonight, I have a programme
for romance"

976
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:25,021
Really?

977
01:45:26,022 --> 01:45:28,734
You provide the background music
and I'll get on with the romance

978
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:38,952
Is this Mr Raj Mathur's house?

979
01:45:40,036 --> 01:45:43,081
"Yes, but he's not in right now"

980
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:48,295
What's the hurry? It's wonderful
that Raj Mathur is not at home

981
01:45:48,962 --> 01:45:51,298
Let me shut the door...
- You?

982
01:45:51,673 --> 01:45:55,635
I'm your immediate neighbour.
The building opposite yours...

983
01:45:55,969 --> 01:46:00,223
"third floor, third window.
- Oh yes, I've seen you"

984
01:46:00,557 --> 01:46:02,309
And I saw you watching

985
01:46:03,685 --> 01:46:07,314
Know what? I've been waiting
for this opportunity for many days

986
01:46:07,939 --> 01:46:09,983
Frankly speaking... so was I

987
01:46:14,488 --> 01:46:16,990
"What do you mean by "so was l"?
What...?"

988
01:46:17,324 --> 01:46:18,658
I'll explain

989
01:46:18,992 --> 01:46:20,994
What are you doing?
- Taking advantage

990
01:46:21,328 --> 01:46:23,788
What advantage?
- He hasn't any time from his trucks

991
01:46:24,122 --> 01:46:27,083
Lay off! Doesn't he have
to work and make money?

992
01:46:27,417 --> 01:46:30,587
Let him make money. You come inside.
- With a stranger...

993
01:46:31,004 --> 01:46:33,215
"What's all this, Priya?
You're kidding, aren't you?"

994
01:46:34,966 --> 01:46:36,009
Mr Neighbour!

995
01:46:36,343 --> 01:46:39,804
I've never seen you
in this light before

996
01:46:40,138 --> 01:46:42,807
"I'm very happy today, Raj.
- Always be happy"

997
01:46:43,141 --> 01:46:45,018
But not with the neighbour

998
01:46:45,810 --> 01:46:47,771
I've got to give you 2 bits
of good news

999
01:46:48,021 --> 01:46:50,023
Give me the second one first

1000
01:46:50,565 --> 01:46:53,360
"Remember, I sent my designs
to an Australian company?"

1001
01:46:54,027 --> 01:46:55,570
They've approved

1002
01:46:56,821 --> 01:46:58,823
And listen to the second
good news

1003
01:47:00,742 --> 01:47:02,744
Tickets for Greece. Look

1004
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:10,043
Tickets for Greece?
You've won a jackpot?

1005
01:47:11,044 --> 01:47:13,296
Aunt Anna gifted it to us

1006
01:47:14,839 --> 01:47:16,049
Aunt Anna?

1007
01:47:17,175 --> 01:47:21,221
"Since we haven't been on a honeymoon,
she asked us to visit Greece, Raj"

1008
01:47:25,976 --> 01:47:29,604
What happened?
- Well... one second

1009
01:47:30,188 --> 01:47:32,065
What happened?
- One second

1010
01:47:32,607 --> 01:47:35,485
"Nothing.
- What happened, Raj? Tell me"

1011
01:47:36,861 --> 01:47:38,822
"Priya, if you don't mind,
let me tell you something"

1012
01:47:39,072 --> 01:47:43,493
"We'll surely go to Greece,
but with our own money, okay?"

1013
01:47:43,827 --> 01:47:46,746
"But this is our money too.
- No, it isn't our money"

1014
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:49,749
It's Aunt Anna's money.
- But aunt's like our mother too

1015
01:47:50,083 --> 01:47:54,087
"No, Priya. For you, she is.
Not for me"

1016
01:47:55,088 --> 01:47:57,382
Why're you making a prestige
issue out of this?

1017
01:47:57,716 --> 01:48:01,678
"C'mon, Priya! It hasn't to do
with prestige, honestly"

1018
01:48:02,095 --> 01:48:05,765
So what is it?
- What is it?

1019
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:09,561
I'll tell you what it is

1020
01:48:09,894 --> 01:48:12,480
I've always got the feeling
that your folks...

1021
01:48:12,814 --> 01:48:15,900
are not very happy with our marriage.
That's how I feel

1022
01:48:16,234 --> 01:48:19,070
They probably think that if you
had got married to Sameer...

1023
01:48:19,404 --> 01:48:22,574
he could have given you everything
that I haven't been able to

1024
01:48:22,907 --> 01:48:25,201
And that's right too. There's
no question of prestige at all

1025
01:48:25,535 --> 01:48:28,329
"Raj, I think you haven't been able
to understand me at all"

1026
01:48:28,705 --> 01:48:30,707
Did I ever say anything
in this regard to you?

1027
01:48:30,874 --> 01:48:31,875
No.
- Did I ever complain?

1028
01:48:32,167 --> 01:48:35,295
So why must you misunderstand?
- Don't raise your voice!

1029
01:48:36,421 --> 01:48:38,423
You're the one who doesn't
get it right

1030
01:48:40,008 --> 01:48:41,926
You are the one they want
to send away on a holiday

1031
01:48:42,135 --> 01:48:43,845
You are the one they pity

1032
01:48:44,137 --> 01:48:46,139
You are the one they want to
see happy... not me or us

1033
01:48:46,598 --> 01:48:50,268
They've got to tolerate me because
I am unfortunately their son-in-law!

1034
01:48:55,148 --> 01:48:57,150
I don't know why you
take things to such limits!

1035
01:48:57,484 --> 01:48:59,569
You think of things
that make no sense!

1036
01:48:59,903 --> 01:49:03,823
Makes no sense?
For you it must be senseless

1037
01:49:04,157 --> 01:49:07,869
"For me, it's a truth
I feel every day..."

1038
01:49:15,293 --> 01:49:17,337
"May we end this discussion here?
- Yes, please!"

1039
01:49:24,177 --> 01:49:25,970
Are you going to sleep?

1040
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:49,619
"Trouble with Priya again?
- No, no trouble with Priya"

1041
01:49:49,994 --> 01:49:52,664
"No, you do have trouble with her.
- Okay, okay"

1042
01:49:52,997 --> 01:49:56,334
"Last night, I had another
argument with Priya. Happy?"

1043
01:49:56,668 --> 01:49:59,546
Happy my foot!
Now listen to me

1044
01:49:59,963 --> 01:50:03,550
"When we buy a new truck, we have
a few problems initially, don't we?"

1045
01:50:03,883 --> 01:50:05,885
What are you talking about?
- Hear me out first!

1046
01:50:06,219 --> 01:50:08,680
"A new truck also stalls
when it heats up, doesn't it?"

1047
01:50:09,013 --> 01:50:10,848
"All right, it does.
- So what do we do?"

1048
01:50:11,015 --> 01:50:13,017
Don't we shut it down
and start it again?

1049
01:50:13,226 --> 01:50:15,895
So there's not much difference
between a truck and marriage

1050
01:50:16,229 --> 01:50:19,023
They ask for a bit of adjustment
which you've got to make...

1051
01:50:19,357 --> 01:50:22,902
and carry the story further. Right?
- How does one take it further?

1052
01:50:23,987 --> 01:50:26,906
Silly arguments! Are marriages
and trucks like each other?

1053
01:50:27,240 --> 01:50:29,701
Isn't it her fault too?
- Now get one thing clearly

1054
01:50:30,034 --> 01:50:32,912
"Between man and wife, never try to
find out who's right and who's wrong"

1055
01:50:33,246 --> 01:50:35,707
Just say sorry and finish
the matter there and then

1056
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:39,669
That's what I always do.
- I'm prepared to say sorry too

1057
01:50:40,044 --> 01:50:43,256
"I don't like fighting,
I don't want to fight"

1058
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:46,217
"But the same rule applies
to her also, doesn't it?"

1059
01:50:46,551 --> 01:50:50,972
"Now look, now don't split hair.
I know the problems with you"

1060
01:50:51,389 --> 01:50:54,392
What's my problem? What?
- Want me start counting?

1061
01:50:56,269 --> 01:50:59,522
"I know, Manubhai. There are
problems with me too"

1062
01:51:00,023 --> 01:51:03,276
That's exactly why I am asking
you to take my advise

1063
01:51:04,444 --> 01:51:07,947
"What am I to do, Manubhai?
- Go to Priya today..."

1064
01:51:08,281 --> 01:51:10,867
like the perfect husband.
The ideal husband

1065
01:51:13,202 --> 01:51:15,288
Ideal?
- Like me

1066
01:51:17,582 --> 01:51:19,417
Is it funny?

1067
01:51:31,304 --> 01:51:35,892
"Priya, I got this gourd,
ladyfinger, carrot..."

1068
01:51:36,309 --> 01:51:41,314
and other stuff from the vendor.
And this one too

1069
01:51:43,316 --> 01:51:47,612
I'll put all this in
the refrigerator

1070
01:51:48,321 --> 01:51:49,989
That is where it is kept

1071
01:51:50,323 --> 01:51:52,658
I bought it all
from the wholesale shop

1072
01:51:53,201 --> 01:51:56,329
The vendor there took me for a fool

1073
01:51:57,121 --> 01:51:59,749
"I asked him for the price of carrots
and he says "30 rupees for a kilo"

1074
01:52:00,041 --> 01:52:04,003
"I asked him to give it at 20 rupees,
or I was leaving"

1075
01:52:05,129 --> 01:52:06,923
He gave it to me at once

1076
01:52:08,132 --> 01:52:10,343
How much would you buy it for?
- 10 rupees a kilo

1077
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:19,685
But this is fresh... and red

1078
01:52:25,358 --> 01:52:28,611
"If there are any chores to
be done, just tell me"

1079
01:52:34,325 --> 01:52:38,162
I'll wash these utensils.
I'm in the mood today

1080
01:52:40,164 --> 01:52:44,544
I forgot to tell you about the office.
Manubhai came calling today

1081
01:52:45,169 --> 01:52:47,171
He had a cup of tea
and went his way

1082
01:52:49,257 --> 01:52:52,051
Mohammadbhai also came calling.
He had a cup of tea and...

1083
01:52:52,385 --> 01:52:54,887
he went his way too

1084
01:52:57,390 --> 01:53:01,811
And then came Vivek.
He asked me for two trucks

1085
01:53:02,144 --> 01:53:05,064
"I said I didn't have two trucks,
they're away for servicing"

1086
01:53:05,398 --> 01:53:08,609
"One had an axle broken,
another's bonnet wouldn't open"

1087
01:53:08,943 --> 01:53:12,280
"And I said, I couldn't
give him the trucks"

1088
01:53:12,613 --> 01:53:14,532
I asked him to have a cup of tea...
and go his way

1089
01:53:16,576 --> 01:53:18,411
He went his way too

1090
01:53:19,370 --> 01:53:21,956
Everybody went his way
at the office today

1091
01:53:26,168 --> 01:53:30,423
Where do I keep these utensils?
- Keep it where you picked it up from

1092
01:53:32,091 --> 01:53:34,427
But here...
- They're washed utensils

1093
01:53:37,179 --> 01:53:38,973
I washed them

1094
01:53:39,432 --> 01:53:41,642
So I washed them again!

1095
01:53:42,310 --> 01:53:44,437
These big vessels
get dirty very soon

1096
01:53:44,770 --> 01:53:46,772
One must wash them
as often as one can

1097
01:53:48,274 --> 01:53:52,111
Look at this one...
gleaming!

1098
01:53:52,445 --> 01:53:58,117
"Raj, I know what you're trying to say.
But you needn't do all this"

1099
01:53:58,451 --> 01:54:01,454
That you realise it
is enough for me

1100
01:54:06,459 --> 01:54:08,794
"Go and sit down. Let me warm the food.
- No, we're having carrot halwa"

1101
01:54:09,128 --> 01:54:11,047
with our dinner tonight.
And I'm making it.

1102
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:14,925
Can you?
- But I'll keep trying till you hug me

1103
01:54:15,301 --> 01:54:18,471
And what's so great about carrot
halwa? Grate a bit of carrot and...

1104
01:54:19,263 --> 01:54:20,890
Does it hurt?

1105
01:54:27,229 --> 01:54:29,815
Know what Priya?
It isn't that finger...

1106
01:54:30,483 --> 01:54:32,485
this is the one I nicked

1107
01:54:32,985 --> 01:54:34,987
I've cut my finger.
Please give me a hug!

1108
01:54:46,290 --> 01:54:47,333
How are you doing?

1109
01:54:47,666 --> 01:54:49,668
"Manubhai, coming for
a cup of tea?"

1110
01:54:51,962 --> 01:54:54,298
"Good morning, my foot!
Have you read the newspapers?"

1111
01:54:54,632 --> 01:54:57,635
Why? Has news of your fight with
your wife been printed in it?

1112
01:55:02,264 --> 01:55:05,184
Look at this.
The company you worked for...

1113
01:55:05,518 --> 01:55:07,520
has closed down overnight.
It has gone bust

1114
01:55:09,522 --> 01:55:11,524
What are you talking about?
- Read it

1115
01:55:13,317 --> 01:55:15,444
"Yes, Raj.
We're in serious trouble"

1116
01:55:15,778 --> 01:55:18,322
The bankers called thrice.
They want to see you

1117
01:55:48,018 --> 01:55:50,980
How will he be able to repay
2.5 million in a single week?

1118
01:55:51,355 --> 01:55:53,232
I can't do anything about that

1119
01:55:53,566 --> 01:55:57,361
"Mr Mathur, if the bank is not
repaid its dues in a week..."

1120
01:55:57,695 --> 01:56:00,573
we'll have to seize
all your properties

1121
01:56:45,701 --> 01:56:48,287
"Raj, where have you been
all this while?"

1122
01:56:48,621 --> 01:56:52,041
I've told you so often to telephone me
if you're going to be late

1123
01:56:52,374 --> 01:56:54,376
Your telephone in the office
wasn't reachable

1124
01:56:54,627 --> 01:56:57,713
I spoke to Vivek and Deepak. Even
they didn't know where you were

1125
01:56:58,422 --> 01:57:01,634
"You know how worried
I get for you, Raj"

1126
01:57:09,308 --> 01:57:10,976
What is the matter?

1127
01:57:11,435 --> 01:57:13,103
"What is it, Raj?"

1128
01:57:13,687 --> 01:57:15,648
Tell me what happened

1129
01:57:17,566 --> 01:57:20,652
The company we have most of
our business dealings with...

1130
01:57:21,445 --> 01:57:25,449
has gone bankrupt. With that
goes the money they owed us

1131
01:57:28,452 --> 01:57:29,536
You mean...?

1132
01:57:29,870 --> 01:57:33,665
I have bank loans and other
debts to repay...

1133
01:57:35,667 --> 01:57:37,669
I don't know what to do

1134
01:57:38,879 --> 01:57:42,424
Don't be upset. Come and
eat something first. Come on

1135
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:43,759
No

1136
01:57:47,429 --> 01:57:49,681
Do you want me to
have a word with Papa?

1137
01:57:51,725 --> 01:57:53,018
"No, Priya"

1138
01:57:55,479 --> 01:57:58,399
Every decision I have taken in life
has been my very own

1139
01:57:59,691 --> 01:58:01,693
I never sought any help

1140
01:58:02,486 --> 01:58:07,282
"And from this difficult situation,
we will have to find our way out"

1141
01:58:13,580 --> 01:58:18,043
"Don't lose hope, Raj.
The two of us will think of a way"

1142
01:58:18,502 --> 01:58:23,715
"You have your Friend with you.
You have faith in Him, don't you?"

1143
01:58:24,508 --> 01:58:26,343
He will help us

1144
01:58:42,693 --> 01:58:45,737
I expected business from your
company and took an extra loan...

1145
01:58:45,863 --> 01:58:49,158
"for two trucks, sir...
- You're getting so worked up..."

1146
01:58:49,741 --> 01:58:52,744
as if it's not my company
but yours that has sunk

1147
01:58:54,246 --> 01:58:59,168
"Actually, sir, there is lot of
money your company owes me"

1148
01:58:59,251 --> 01:59:02,421
"No, no... the company
owes you nothing"

1149
01:59:02,754 --> 01:59:07,759
"It "owed" you money. Past tense.
Because the company is no more"

1150
01:59:09,761 --> 01:59:12,347
"But I did my work with
all honesty, sir..."

1151
01:59:12,890 --> 01:59:16,768
Why did you?
Did I ask you to be honest?

1152
01:59:17,311 --> 01:59:22,190
Look at me! My company has sunk!
But have I sunk? No

1153
01:59:22,357 --> 01:59:24,192
Learn something

1154
01:59:24,776 --> 01:59:29,197
"I'm no match for you, sir.
All I want..."

1155
01:59:29,531 --> 01:59:34,453
Now don't bother me. I'm going
away to Europe for two months

1156
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:37,456
I'm very tired.
I want to relax

1157
01:59:39,791 --> 01:59:44,212
"But yes, I'm thinking of starting
a new company after I return"

1158
01:59:44,796 --> 01:59:47,799
You can meet me then.
I'll do something for you

1159
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:50,218
"In the meantime, you can
take a holiday too"

1160
01:59:50,385 --> 01:59:53,221
Where do you folks go?
What do you call that place...?

1161
01:59:53,347 --> 01:59:57,809
"Khandala...? Go to Khandala.
- Thank you, sir..."

1162
01:59:59,019 --> 02:00:03,231
but I don't want to go anywhere.
It's just that by the time you return...

1163
02:00:03,815 --> 02:00:05,567
the time the bank has given me
will be over

1164
02:00:05,817 --> 02:00:09,821
You're ruining my time
and my mood now

1165
02:00:11,448 --> 02:00:14,826
There are many people like you who
are upset at the company going bust

1166
02:00:15,118 --> 02:00:19,831
And I haven't started a charity to
distribute alms to everyone coming here!

1167
02:00:20,832 --> 02:00:23,835
"I'm not asking for alms, sir.
I'm asking for my rights"

1168
02:00:24,336 --> 02:00:30,509
Rights? You don't ask for rights!
You only ask for alms

1169
02:00:30,801 --> 02:00:33,845
"If you want your rights,
go to the courts"

1170
02:01:05,168 --> 02:01:08,880
"Raj, have this coffee.
And change your clothes quickly"

1171
02:01:17,556 --> 02:01:19,099
"What is the matter, Raj?"

1172
02:01:24,146 --> 02:01:25,897
"What happened, Raj?"

1173
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:30,902
I... I just felt like crying

1174
02:02:02,934 --> 02:02:06,354
"Nothing's working, Manubhai.
I've tried everything"

1175
02:02:06,938 --> 02:02:08,940
We'll have to sell the trucks

1176
02:02:10,442 --> 02:02:13,361
Everything's going to go away.
- No way

1177
02:02:13,445 --> 02:02:16,948
I'll telephone Jignesh right away.
- Why keep calling Jignesh!

1178
02:02:17,073 --> 02:02:20,368
How many people will you talk to?
You spoke to... Saeed earlier

1179
02:02:20,952 --> 02:02:22,954
Did he give you any money?
Nobody's going to

1180
02:02:23,455 --> 02:02:26,583
You've given me so much already.
This chap is cancelling his wedding

1181
02:02:26,958 --> 02:02:29,961
"Everybody's trying his best,
but nothing's happening. Nothing"

1182
02:02:30,086 --> 02:02:34,966
"Look, have patience. Ups and downs
are part of business. Right?"

1183
02:02:35,091 --> 02:02:38,970
"Oh yes, don't lose hope, Raj.
We'll find a way out"

1184
02:02:39,095 --> 02:02:40,972
What way will we find...? What?

1185
02:02:41,139 --> 02:02:44,392
Someone else's company closes down
and the bank holds me by the throat!

1186
02:02:44,476 --> 02:02:45,977
Let me try

1187
02:02:47,187 --> 02:02:50,982
There's another notice from the bank.
- What new notice is this?

1188
02:02:51,274 --> 02:02:54,402
"It says, you've got to 3.5 million,
not 2.5"

1189
02:02:54,986 --> 02:02:59,407
3.5 million? How come?
I've settled it at 2.5 with the bank!

1190
02:02:59,658 --> 02:03:01,993
"Look at how the bankers
are behaving, Manubhai"

1191
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:04,412
I had a clear understanding
with them that...

1192
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:11,002
This is a cheque. For 2.5 million

1193
02:03:13,630 --> 02:03:16,424
It's yours.
- Ours

1194
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:19,427
Don't worry. I haven't taken it
from Papa. I swear

1195
02:03:20,011 --> 02:03:22,430
Remember my assignment
from the Australian company?

1196
02:03:24,015 --> 02:03:26,184
It has been approved.
And this is the advance

1197
02:03:27,185 --> 02:03:31,439
"But who'd give 2.5 as an advance...?
- Big folks, big business"

1198
02:03:32,023 --> 02:03:35,026
They have hefty advances too.
They aren't beggars like us

1199
02:03:36,152 --> 02:03:39,030
You can have the money.
I'll manage on credit

1200
02:03:41,700 --> 02:03:44,452
"What a narrow escape! Else,
we'd have lost this office too..."

1201
02:03:44,536 --> 02:03:47,455
and we'd sit under the
staircase with our accounts

1202
02:03:53,461 --> 02:03:56,464
"Manubhai, don't drink too much.
- This is my first drink!"

1203
02:03:59,050 --> 02:04:01,469
This is the photograph Raj had
torn up in a fit of emotions

1204
02:04:07,058 --> 02:04:09,060
Why're you roaming around
with the photo?

1205
02:04:10,061 --> 02:04:15,483
I've had to work so hard for Priya...
and the photo's damaged anyway

1206
02:04:28,079 --> 02:04:31,082
"What are you upto, Raj?
What will Priya think?"

1207
02:04:31,583 --> 02:04:34,502
It's Priya I'm doing it too.
- I see. Go ahead

1208
02:04:36,087 --> 02:04:39,090
"Know what, Manubhai? I'll telephone
Sameer and call him over"

1209
02:04:39,257 --> 02:04:42,510
"All right... who's that?
- Her friend from Europe, remember?"

1210
02:04:42,719 --> 02:04:46,097
"No, he'll find it odd here!
- He'll talk to her..."

1211
02:04:46,431 --> 02:04:49,100
"and she'll be happy. Else,
we keep talking only about the garage"

1212
02:04:50,101 --> 02:04:52,520
"Sameer, this is Raj here.
Where are you?"

1213
02:04:53,104 --> 02:04:56,524
You're so close to our house!
Come over

1214
02:04:58,109 --> 02:05:01,112
"We're having a party,
a small get-together..."

1215
02:05:01,237 --> 02:05:03,531
come over. Priya's here too

1216
02:05:04,782 --> 02:05:06,117
Talk to her

1217
02:05:10,246 --> 02:05:13,541
It's Sameer. I've called him over

1218
02:05:18,129 --> 02:05:21,132
"No, it's a small get-together.
- One moment"

1219
02:05:22,133 --> 02:05:24,552
"Sameer, Priya's busy
for a second"

1220
02:05:28,556 --> 02:05:31,142
"Yes, Sameer. Talk to her"

1221
02:05:35,438 --> 02:05:37,148
Raj insists that you must come

1222
02:05:40,151 --> 02:05:42,654
"And listen, I'm talking to you
from another room now"

1223
02:05:43,571 --> 02:05:46,574
Don't even make the mistake of
telling Raj...

1224
02:05:46,658 --> 02:05:48,576
that you're the one I took
the money from

1225
02:05:49,160 --> 02:05:51,913
"It should remain between
you and me, Sameer"

1226
02:05:54,457 --> 02:05:56,459
Raj mustn't get to know

1227
02:06:10,598 --> 02:06:12,350
I've been talking to Sameer

1228
02:06:16,688 --> 02:06:18,189
"Is there anything you want, Raj?"

1229
02:06:20,650 --> 02:06:21,693
No

1230
02:06:28,199 --> 02:06:30,618
So Sameer was the one
who gave you the money?

1231
02:06:33,204 --> 02:06:36,624
Just tell me whether Sameer
gave you the money or not

1232
02:06:37,875 --> 02:06:40,211
"Raj, I...
- Yes, or no!"

1233
02:06:42,213 --> 02:06:43,214
Yes

1234
02:06:43,631 --> 02:06:46,384
Why did you take the money from Sameer?
- Raj...

1235
02:06:46,551 --> 02:06:49,220
Why did you take it from Sameer?
- Talk softly

1236
02:06:49,387 --> 02:06:52,640
We have guests at home.
We'll end up having a drama...

1237
02:06:52,849 --> 02:06:56,227
But we're already part of a drama!
You're worried about the guests?

1238
02:06:56,519 --> 02:06:59,647
I'll show you what a drama is!

1239
02:07:03,234 --> 02:07:06,237
Thanks for coming to the party.
Shut that music!

1240
02:07:08,948 --> 02:07:10,867
Go home. This moment!

1241
02:07:13,911 --> 02:07:15,246
I'm not kidding!

1242
02:07:16,539 --> 02:07:17,832
Go away!
- It's only 10

1243
02:07:17,874 --> 02:07:21,252
The party at my house is
over at 10. Get going!

1244
02:07:23,254 --> 02:07:26,257
What's gotten into you?
- I'm sorry

1245
02:07:26,674 --> 02:07:29,677
"Before I get nastier, go away.
- All right"

1246
02:07:42,398 --> 02:07:44,275
"The drama is over, okay?"

1247
02:07:44,609 --> 02:07:48,279
"Now tell me, why did you
take the money from Sameer?"

1248
02:07:49,572 --> 02:07:52,909
"You had a bank loan to repay...
you were so upset, Raj"

1249
02:07:53,284 --> 02:07:55,453
And so you took the money
from Sameer?

1250
02:07:56,078 --> 02:07:58,289
"You didn't sleep all nights, Raj."

1251
02:07:58,581 --> 02:08:02,710
Now I won't sleep all my life!
You took money from Sameer!

1252
02:08:03,294 --> 02:08:05,713
What would be the worst
thing to happen? What?

1253
02:08:06,005 --> 02:08:09,300
"Our business would have wound up,
this house would have been sold..."

1254
02:08:09,425 --> 02:08:12,720
and we'd have been out on the streets.
But there are millions on the streets!

1255
02:08:12,929 --> 02:08:16,307
"Their life is a struggle, but
they have faith in each other"

1256
02:08:16,641 --> 02:08:19,727
"They trust each other.
- I tried everywhere, Raj"

1257
02:08:20,436 --> 02:08:22,813
I even spoke to the export company

1258
02:08:23,314 --> 02:08:26,108
"But when they didn't give me
any money, I asked Sameer..."

1259
02:08:26,317 --> 02:08:28,319
I didn't take a penny
from my own father!

1260
02:08:28,819 --> 02:08:31,447
"I didn't borrow from my relatives,
not even from your father!"

1261
02:08:31,739 --> 02:08:35,743
And you went and begged Sameer?
What will he think?

1262
02:08:36,327 --> 02:08:42,750
That it's because of his favours
that I'm so happy and delighted!

1263
02:08:42,875 --> 02:08:45,753
"It's no favour, Raj.
It's business"

1264
02:08:45,962 --> 02:08:48,339
"I've got to make garments for him, Raj.
I've only taken an advance"

1265
02:08:50,758 --> 02:08:53,135
Are you going to
teach me business now?

1266
02:08:54,762 --> 02:08:58,766
Does anyone give such a big advance?
And you know why he gave the advance!

1267
02:08:58,891 --> 02:09:01,352
"You know it and I know it,
you will not say it..."

1268
02:09:01,686 --> 02:09:04,772
But I'll tell you!
He gave you the advance...

1269
02:09:04,897 --> 02:09:07,358
because he's still in love with you.
- Raj!

1270
02:09:08,484 --> 02:09:10,361
And you know that he's
in love with you!

1271
02:09:10,486 --> 02:09:11,988
Which is why he gave the money

1272
02:09:14,031 --> 02:09:16,367
You know he loves you
and gave you the money

1273
02:09:16,659 --> 02:09:18,786
Does anyone give such a huge
advance just like that?

1274
02:09:26,794 --> 02:09:29,797
"Priya, Sameer's here.
Welcome, Sameer"

1275
02:09:30,381 --> 02:09:33,801
You're the one we were waiting for.
We were talking about you

1276
02:09:35,386 --> 02:09:38,806
It's your house...
he has brought you flowers!

1277
02:09:40,683 --> 02:09:43,811
"Sorry, I've broken all the bottles.
- What is the matter, Priya?"

1278
02:09:43,894 --> 02:09:45,813
I'll tell you what the matter is

1279
02:09:46,397 --> 02:09:49,817
The truth is that the two of you
have made a fool out of me

1280
02:09:50,401 --> 02:09:53,404
All I want to know is
why you did it?

1281
02:09:53,571 --> 02:09:57,533
"It's between you and me, Raj. Why
are you dragging Sameer into it?"

1282
02:09:57,700 --> 02:10:02,830
"Don't stand up for Sameer!
Don't... okay, okay, I'm sorry"

1283
02:10:03,122 --> 02:10:06,834
"Do stand up for him! Go ahead!
You're made for each other, right?"

1284
02:10:08,044 --> 02:10:11,130
"She's wearing such a lovely sari,
and look at your suit..."

1285
02:10:11,422 --> 02:10:12,840
Which suit is this?

1286
02:10:13,424 --> 02:10:15,843
"I'm not fighting, I'm only
taking a look at the suit"

1287
02:10:16,427 --> 02:10:18,429
Don't touch me! I'm taking
a look at his suit!

1288
02:10:28,439 --> 02:10:29,940
"What are you talking about, Raj?"

1289
02:10:35,738 --> 02:10:38,866
I've got nothing. You've got the money!
It's aunt who sends tickets for me

1290
02:10:39,450 --> 02:10:42,453
And your dream of childhood
in Switzerland...

1291
02:10:48,459 --> 02:10:50,878
And there's Sameer
to lend us money

1292
02:10:52,713 --> 02:10:54,882
This is between the two of you.
I must leave

1293
02:10:54,965 --> 02:10:57,885
Where d'you think you're going?
It's between the two of you!

1294
02:10:57,968 --> 02:11:00,137
Rather I go away!

1295
02:11:01,472 --> 02:11:04,892
"Actually, I'll call a priest and
have the two of you married"

1296
02:11:06,227 --> 02:11:08,896
"Why even call a priest? I know
the rites, I was recently married"

1297
02:11:08,979 --> 02:11:11,482
I remember everything.
Give me your hand...

1298
02:11:12,483 --> 02:11:13,901
"What are you up to, Raj?"

1299
02:11:57,528 --> 02:12:00,531
I'm in love...

1300
02:12:01,532 --> 02:12:04,535
you are in love...

1301
02:12:05,202 --> 02:12:09,957
so what have things come to be?

1302
02:12:12,710 --> 02:12:15,796
I am not unfaithful...

1303
02:12:16,547 --> 02:12:19,550
you are not unfaithful...

1304
02:12:20,217 --> 02:12:25,973
"so why do we hold
so much against each other?"

1305
02:12:28,142 --> 02:12:32,980
We were walking together...

1306
02:12:35,190 --> 02:12:39,987
"so what caused these
distances between us?"

1307
02:12:46,076 --> 02:12:48,996
We don't even know...

1308
02:12:50,581 --> 02:12:55,586
where we are headed

1309
02:13:19,276 --> 02:13:24,031
"I'm in love,
you are in love..."

1310
02:13:24,615 --> 02:13:28,619
so what have things come to be?

1311
02:13:29,620 --> 02:13:31,622
I am not unfaithful...

1312
02:13:32,039 --> 02:13:34,041
you are not unfaithful...

1313
02:13:34,625 --> 02:13:38,045
"so why do we hold
so much against each other?"

1314
02:13:40,005 --> 02:13:44,051
We were walking together...

1315
02:13:44,885 --> 02:13:49,056
"how have we come to be distanced
from each other?"

1316
02:13:54,645 --> 02:13:57,064
We don't even know...

1317
02:13:58,106 --> 02:14:01,068
where we will go

1318
02:14:23,465 --> 02:14:27,678
"My heart is immersed
in pain..."

1319
02:14:29,471 --> 02:14:32,683
my eyes are filled with tears

1320
02:14:33,976 --> 02:14:38,105
This season of loneliness...

1321
02:14:38,689 --> 02:14:42,109
isolates me from my path

1322
02:14:44,111 --> 02:14:48,115
"We had dreamt of achieving
our goal together"

1323
02:14:49,283 --> 02:14:53,704
But our paths are now different

1324
02:14:53,912 --> 02:14:58,125
Even as we walked together...

1325
02:14:58,375 --> 02:15:02,129
"I wonder how we
have lost our way"

1326
02:15:16,351 --> 02:15:20,731
"I'm in love,
you are in love..."

1327
02:15:21,064 --> 02:15:25,152
so what have things come to be?

1328
02:15:38,165 --> 02:15:41,168
Look at the lovebirds.
They're at it again

1329
02:15:41,752 --> 02:15:47,174
Their romance is beginning and Raj
and Priya's love is coming to an end

1330
02:15:47,758 --> 02:15:52,179
It's almost a month now.
- No one knows what caused the trouble

1331
02:15:52,262 --> 02:15:54,181
One moment. I'll explain

1332
02:15:54,431 --> 02:15:56,183
"Radha, come here"

1333
02:15:56,767 --> 02:16:00,437
Let's suppose Radha is Priya
and he's Raj

1334
02:16:00,771 --> 02:16:04,524
Now say something to each other.
Anything... get started

1335
02:16:06,109 --> 02:16:07,194
Go on

1336
02:16:07,778 --> 02:16:11,365
It's the man who starts it all.
- Why? It's the woman who starts it

1337
02:16:11,448 --> 02:16:14,201
"A woman speaks only when the man
does something wrong, isn't it?"

1338
02:16:14,534 --> 02:16:16,953
Are you telling me that it's the man
who's always at fault?

1339
02:16:17,120 --> 02:16:20,207
"Whatever, it's the man who
actually starts it all"

1340
02:16:20,290 --> 02:16:22,793
Won't the man react
when his wife keeps nagging him?

1341
02:16:22,959 --> 02:16:26,797
"Don't say anything against women, okay?
- Not against men either, okay?"

1342
02:16:27,089 --> 02:16:29,466
"Because you're a man, you've
got the power to scream at me?"

1343
02:16:29,591 --> 02:16:31,134
And who gave you the
power to scream at me?

1344
02:16:31,301 --> 02:16:33,804
"Enough, enough!
I get it"

1345
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:36,223
Neither of them are at fault

1346
02:16:36,807 --> 02:16:38,809
They've separated for
no rhyme or reason

1347
02:16:40,811 --> 02:16:45,232
Wash the windshield properly.
It's the last time

1348
02:16:45,816 --> 02:16:49,820
So you've examined the truck?
Tell us if there is a problem

1349
02:16:51,822 --> 02:16:56,827
"Raj, think it over again
with a cool mind"

1350
02:16:57,119 --> 02:17:00,247
"You're not making a mistake by
selling off your trucks, are you?"

1351
02:17:02,124 --> 02:17:05,252
"I know I'm making a mistake, Manubhai.
- So why?"

1352
02:17:05,502 --> 02:17:09,256
I'm making a mistake.
But I have no other choice

1353
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:12,843
"Unless I return Sameer's money,
I can't have any peace"

1354
02:17:23,353 --> 02:17:26,648
I wish to meet Mr Sameer Arora.
My name is Raj Mathur

1355
02:17:26,815 --> 02:17:29,359
"Mr Mathur, he's in a meeting
right now. Please be seated"

1356
02:17:30,068 --> 02:17:33,530
Tell him Raj Mathur is here.
It's urgent

1357
02:17:33,780 --> 02:17:36,533
"He's busy in a personal
meeting, Mr Mathur"

1358
02:17:36,658 --> 02:17:39,286
He has told us not to disturb
him for the next half hour

1359
02:17:39,369 --> 02:17:40,871
Please sit down

1360
02:18:35,925 --> 02:18:40,347
"When he's through with his personal
meeting, give him this cheque"

1361
02:18:47,604 --> 02:18:50,607
I'm telling you again.
Keep the cheque

1362
02:18:51,941 --> 02:18:55,362
"You can return it to me later.
- No, Sameer"

1363
02:18:55,945 --> 02:18:58,615
My work with the Australian
company has already begun

1364
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:03,370
"I know that, Priya.
But I'm feeling very strange..."

1365
02:19:04,162 --> 02:19:06,706
the way you're returning
this cheque to me

1366
02:19:07,290 --> 02:19:09,959
"For me, it's very important to
return the cheque to you, Sameer"

1367
02:19:10,293 --> 02:19:14,381
"In fact, I shouldn't have
taken it from you at all"

1368
02:19:16,091 --> 02:19:20,970
"No, Priya. If a friend doesn't
help a friend, who will?"

1369
02:19:22,097 --> 02:19:26,393
"No, Sameer. It was my mistake"

1370
02:19:28,603 --> 02:19:32,982
"Before taking the money from you,
I should've considered..."

1371
02:19:34,192 --> 02:19:37,362
how much it would hurt Raj

1372
02:19:46,996 --> 02:19:51,418
If you think your relations with Raj
will be okay if I take back the money...

1373
02:19:51,668 --> 02:19:54,671
"I'll take it back.
- No, Sameer"

1374
02:19:55,588 --> 02:20:00,426
It isn't about money.
It's not money

1375
02:20:02,137 --> 02:20:08,434
"I admit, I made a mistake.
But what Raj said and did..."

1376
02:20:09,018 --> 02:20:13,439
no woman can ever tolerate.
She can't ever

1377
02:20:19,237 --> 02:20:23,449
"I had to relieve myself of a burden,
and I've done it"

1378
02:20:37,338 --> 02:20:39,382
Raj is such a fortunate man

1379
02:20:41,342 --> 02:20:43,178
You love him so much

1380
02:20:49,058 --> 02:20:54,480
"Let me drop you home.
- No, Sameer. I'll go on my own"

1381
02:21:05,074 --> 02:21:07,493
"I'm glad you're here, Manubhai.
- What happened?"

1382
02:21:07,619 --> 02:21:12,081
"Raj has been drinking all evening,
talking about Priya. Look"

1383
02:21:16,586 --> 02:21:19,088
Not a word from you.
I'll talk to him

1384
02:21:23,259 --> 02:21:26,888
"Raj, what's up?
Stop it now"

1385
02:21:27,096 --> 02:21:29,098
Let me drink this up

1386
02:21:29,182 --> 02:21:30,433
"What happened, Raj?"

1387
02:21:31,601 --> 02:21:36,522
All I want to ask Priya is:
Why did she go to Sameer?

1388
02:21:37,106 --> 02:21:40,109
"They're childhood friends,
we all know that"

1389
02:21:40,526 --> 02:21:45,782
"Raj, you aren't suggesting...?
- What rubbish! No!"

1390
02:21:46,574 --> 02:21:48,534
"I didn't mean that... no, not at all"

1391
02:21:48,618 --> 02:21:52,121
All I want to ask is why
she went to Sameer. That's it

1392
02:21:54,123 --> 02:21:57,126
"You're no longer together,
it could be anything else"

1393
02:21:57,210 --> 02:21:59,128
"What say, Manubhai?
- What anything else?"

1394
02:22:00,546 --> 02:22:04,550
What if she's not with me?
She's still my wife and I...

1395
02:22:05,343 --> 02:22:09,138
"Why're you getting sentimental?
- Yes, I'm sentimental!"

1396
02:22:10,139 --> 02:22:13,559
"And she knows that too and
despite that, she went there"

1397
02:22:21,484 --> 02:22:24,153
I'll be back in a moment.
- Where to?

1398
02:22:24,487 --> 02:22:27,782
I'll just go and ask Priya
why she went to Sameer

1399
02:22:27,865 --> 02:22:29,158
Listen...

1400
02:22:30,493 --> 02:22:34,705
"You think I'm going to fight with her?
Bansi, get us some more drinks"

1401
02:22:35,164 --> 02:22:38,167
"If I had to fight, I'd have
given Sameer a punch right there"

1402
02:22:39,168 --> 02:22:41,921
I'm only going to ask her.
Only to ask her

1403
02:22:42,839 --> 02:22:44,966
Go ahead and drink.
I'll be back

1404
02:22:47,176 --> 02:22:48,594
"No, I don't want the car"

1405
02:22:48,719 --> 02:22:51,180
Theirs is a strange love.
I can't understand it

1406
02:22:52,890 --> 02:22:55,935
I think there's going to be a fight

1407
02:22:56,978 --> 02:22:59,689
But I also get the feeling that...

1408
02:23:00,064 --> 02:23:04,610
"since he's meeting her after
many days, they'll get cozy"

1409
02:23:04,986 --> 02:23:07,196
lt'll all be settled.
Take it from me

1410
02:23:07,530 --> 02:23:09,740
"Bansi, get us some glasses"

1411
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:22,378
"Madam, one Raj Mathur
is here to meet you"

1412
02:23:22,753 --> 02:23:27,300
Raj Mathur? At this hour?
Ask him to come tomorrow morning

1413
02:23:27,633 --> 02:23:30,219
"Tomorrow morning? Okay, madam...
- Tomorrow morning, my foot!"

1414
02:23:30,553 --> 02:23:32,221
Give me the phone

1415
02:23:33,973 --> 02:23:37,476
"Aunt, it's Raj.
I want to have a word with Priya"

1416
02:23:37,852 --> 02:23:40,980
You can't meet her at this hour.
Is this any time for decent folks?

1417
02:23:41,314 --> 02:23:46,235
What decent folks? I want to talk
to my wife. Please give her the phone

1418
02:23:47,862 --> 02:23:50,323
I told you once.
You can't meet her. That's it

1419
02:23:50,656 --> 02:23:51,908
What's once...?

1420
02:23:53,242 --> 02:23:55,036
She hung up on me!

1421
02:23:55,620 --> 02:23:57,914
I don't need anyone's permission
to meet my wife!

1422
02:23:58,247 --> 02:24:00,708
"What are you doing, sir?
- Please leave"

1423
02:24:01,042 --> 02:24:03,002
I want to see my wife

1424
02:24:17,058 --> 02:24:18,726
"Guard, don't let him get in"

1425
02:24:18,935 --> 02:24:22,229
Will I have to take your permission
to meet my wife?

1426
02:24:22,563 --> 02:24:25,066
We have so many problems
only because of you!

1427
02:24:26,025 --> 02:24:27,693
Don't talk like a thug

1428
02:24:27,902 --> 02:24:29,528
You call me a thug!

1429
02:24:29,779 --> 02:24:30,947
"Yes, you're a thug"

1430
02:24:31,280 --> 02:24:33,950
"You're a thug, a ruffian!
- Get the hell out of here!"

1431
02:24:34,283 --> 02:24:35,993
Why're you pushing me?

1432
02:24:36,285 --> 02:24:39,372
What drama is this? Stop it!
Let us sleep!

1433
02:24:39,705 --> 02:24:42,083
Go inside and sleep!
- Stop this drama

1434
02:24:42,416 --> 02:24:44,418
Decent folks live here.
- You're decent...

1435
02:24:44,752 --> 02:24:48,089
"because you live in tall buildings?
She calls me a thug, a ruffian!"

1436
02:24:48,422 --> 02:24:50,633
I'm going to beat her up!

1437
02:24:51,092 --> 02:24:52,426
Stop pushing me

1438
02:24:55,471 --> 02:24:57,723
What's the matter?
What racket is this?

1439
02:24:58,099 --> 02:25:00,768
"It's your son-in-law, the thug.
He's showing his true colours"

1440
02:25:01,102 --> 02:25:02,645
Leave me alone!

1441
02:25:29,338 --> 02:25:32,466
I'll tell the police you are
not letting me meet my wife

1442
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:34,927
Even the police have arrived!

1443
02:25:35,344 --> 02:25:37,680
Let go of my hand!
I'll report you guys

1444
02:25:38,139 --> 02:25:39,807
Let go of him. Leave him alone.
- Sir...

1445
02:25:40,141 --> 02:25:42,143
I want to meet my wife.
- You get drunk and cause trouble?

1446
02:25:42,351 --> 02:25:43,352
No

1447
02:25:43,602 --> 02:25:45,604
Say whatever you want to
at the police station

1448
02:25:49,108 --> 02:25:52,820
"What are you doing, sir...?
I want to meet my wife"

1449
02:25:53,154 --> 02:25:53,821
Hold it

1450
02:25:56,031 --> 02:25:57,658
Please let him go

1451
02:26:00,244 --> 02:26:01,996
He's my husband

1452
02:26:03,164 --> 02:26:05,791
Your husband?
- Yes

1453
02:26:08,502 --> 02:26:12,173
"All right. I'll let him go,
because you're asking me to"

1454
02:26:13,090 --> 02:26:15,718
You are educated and decent folks

1455
02:26:16,093 --> 02:26:19,013
Does it look nice to publicly
behave like a thug?

1456
02:26:19,346 --> 02:26:21,640
Get in... go on
Get on with your work

1457
02:26:22,141 --> 02:26:24,935
It's a husband-wife quarrel.
Go on

1458
02:26:56,217 --> 02:26:58,219
"Go home, Raj. Please"

1459
02:27:01,347 --> 02:27:03,766
"You've made a mockery
of our marriage, Raj"

1460
02:27:04,558 --> 02:27:08,103
It wasn't my intention
to do that

1461
02:27:09,146 --> 02:27:13,067
All I came to ask you was...

1462
02:27:13,442 --> 02:27:16,779
"and they stopped me.
Called me a thug, a ruffian"

1463
02:27:18,656 --> 02:27:21,617
"I don't know why it happened.
- It happens all the time, Raj?"

1464
02:27:22,493 --> 02:27:26,914
All the time?
In Sameer's presence the other day...

1465
02:27:27,331 --> 02:27:31,460
"and now, in the presence
of the whole world? Why?"

1466
02:27:32,544 --> 02:27:36,173
Have you ever thought
what I'm going through?

1467
02:27:39,260 --> 02:27:42,888
"I try to do one thing, but I always
end up doing something else"

1468
02:27:44,348 --> 02:27:48,644
"I know that.
I know you very well, Raj"

1469
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:52,606
But I can't take it anymore.
I can't

1470
02:27:55,275 --> 02:27:58,821
Rather than live together
and hurt each other...

1471
02:28:00,197 --> 02:28:02,032
we'd better separate

1472
02:28:04,284 --> 02:28:06,495
"Don't say that, Priya"

1473
02:28:07,287 --> 02:28:10,624
"Remember what you once told me, Raj?"

1474
02:28:13,293 --> 02:28:16,839
"In the world somewhere,
there will be someone very happy..."

1475
02:28:17,506 --> 02:28:20,509
because you are happy
Remember?

1476
02:28:24,304 --> 02:28:26,807
Go on. Go home

1477
02:29:09,433 --> 02:29:15,272
"My child, think again.
It's a very crucial step"

1478
02:29:15,647 --> 02:29:18,233
And you can't take such decisions
in haste

1479
02:29:18,567 --> 02:29:21,028
"Kishore, what's gotten into you?"

1480
02:29:21,361 --> 02:29:24,364
If Priya has decided to leave India
and go away to Greece...

1481
02:29:24,698 --> 02:29:27,159
she must've thought about it

1482
02:29:27,493 --> 02:29:30,829
You saw the racket
he created last night

1483
02:29:31,288 --> 02:29:32,372
Priya...?

1484
02:29:36,376 --> 02:29:39,588
It's very difficult for me
to live with Raj

1485
02:29:41,590 --> 02:29:46,845
And it's also difficult for me
to live here and stay away from him

1486
02:30:02,319 --> 02:30:04,321
"What have I gone
and done, Manubhai?"

1487
02:30:05,405 --> 02:30:08,742
What did I set out to do...?
And what did I end up doing!

1488
02:30:09,076 --> 02:30:14,039
That's the trouble with you!
You think after you do!

1489
02:30:17,709 --> 02:30:21,213
What am I to do now?

1490
02:30:21,630 --> 02:30:24,967
What can you do?
You've done what you had to!

1491
02:30:25,300 --> 02:30:28,553
So why're you asking us
what to do? Why ask us!

1492
02:30:28,929 --> 02:30:32,641
After doing everything...
- Calm down

1493
02:30:37,604 --> 02:30:41,191
"Son, let's go home"

1494
02:30:41,775 --> 02:30:45,112
"No, I'm not going home"

1495
02:30:45,529 --> 02:30:46,780
Hear that?

1496
02:30:48,448 --> 02:30:50,450
I feel very lonely there

1497
02:30:52,452 --> 02:30:57,666
Tell me... what should I do?
I don't want to lose her

1498
02:30:59,751 --> 02:31:03,338
"Raj, Priya called to say she's
going away to Greece forever"

1499
02:31:03,672 --> 02:31:06,675
She has left for the airport.
The flight leaves at 10:30

1500
02:31:07,551 --> 02:31:10,470
Hear that? What are you
going to do now?

1501
02:31:10,804 --> 02:31:12,681
She's leaving!

1502
02:31:13,390 --> 02:31:15,934
"No, I won't let her go"

1503
02:31:17,227 --> 02:31:19,187
I'm not letting Priya go away

1504
02:32:15,535 --> 02:32:17,287
Where's Priya?
- She has left

1505
02:32:17,621 --> 02:32:19,331
Where?
- She's in there

1506
02:32:19,539 --> 02:32:22,167
"Where to? Where's your ticket?
- Mister, I've got to in"

1507
02:32:22,542 --> 02:32:25,295
"He's not going abroad,
he's going to meet his wife"

1508
02:32:25,629 --> 02:32:27,088
That's not allowed

1509
02:32:29,758 --> 02:32:31,551
Mr Tiwari...
- What happened?

1510
02:32:31,885 --> 02:32:33,887
Priya's going away.
- Where to?

1511
02:32:34,262 --> 02:32:35,931
She's leaving me and going away.
- Don't tell me!

1512
02:32:36,181 --> 02:32:39,226
I've got to stop her. Please ask him
to let me go in for five minutes

1513
02:32:39,559 --> 02:32:41,436
Let me talk to him

1514
02:32:41,770 --> 02:32:43,563
"Listen, Yadav"

1515
02:32:49,486 --> 02:32:52,113
"Go on, Raj. Hurry up.
- Just 15 minutes"

1516
02:32:53,573 --> 02:32:56,451
Where are you going...?
- One moment

1517
02:32:56,785 --> 02:32:59,120
Listen...

1518
02:33:03,792 --> 02:33:05,126
Hurry!

1519
02:34:55,695 --> 02:34:56,905
Don't go

1520
02:34:58,031 --> 02:35:01,910
I know I've made a mistake.
Please forgive me

1521
02:35:05,789 --> 02:35:10,168
"Raj, that's just what I was trying
to explain to you last night"

1522
02:35:11,711 --> 02:35:14,506
Rather than live together
and hurt each other...

1523
02:35:14,923 --> 02:35:16,508
we'd better part

1524
02:35:18,843 --> 02:35:21,721
Whether you take the decision
to separate or I...

1525
02:35:22,055 --> 02:35:25,934
"isn't it one and the same thing?
- No, Priya"

1526
02:35:27,644 --> 02:35:29,646
"I know, I'm the one
who has made a mistake"

1527
02:35:30,939 --> 02:35:34,275
But give me one more chance.
Please Priya

1528
02:35:36,277 --> 02:35:38,154
"Can you be happy without me, Priya?"

1529
02:35:41,741 --> 02:35:43,618
"Maybe not, Raj"

1530
02:35:44,953 --> 02:35:48,289
But it isn't necessary to have
the company of someone you love...

1531
02:35:49,082 --> 02:35:51,167
"for a lifetime, is it?"

1532
02:35:58,758 --> 02:36:02,971
"How many times will you say that, Raj?
How many times?"

1533
02:36:04,973 --> 02:36:08,810
"Don't make it any more difficult
for me to go away, Raj. Please don't"

1534
02:36:11,938 --> 02:36:14,983
Maybe this is what was
to come out of our marriage

1535
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:27,328
"No, Priya. This isn't
the outcome of our marriage"

1536
02:36:34,002 --> 02:36:37,005
"Priya, I've had a dream"

1537
02:36:39,007 --> 02:36:44,012
We have two children.
A son and a daughter

1538
02:36:45,930 --> 02:36:48,016
The son is just like you

1539
02:36:49,017 --> 02:36:53,146
He only has a nose like mine

1540
02:36:58,026 --> 02:37:02,113
The daughter is very pretty.
She has your eyes...

1541
02:37:02,905 --> 02:37:06,326
she's very nice too. Like you

1542
02:37:12,165 --> 02:37:14,208
"You're a very nice person, Priya"

1543
02:37:15,835 --> 02:37:18,463
"I could've changed for the
better too, in your company"

1544
02:37:19,756 --> 02:37:22,342
"Don't go away, Priya.
I'll change my ways..."

1545
02:37:23,843 --> 02:37:27,055
"I'm sorry, Aunt Anna"

1546
02:37:32,518 --> 02:37:35,772
I'll even say sorry to Sameer

1547
02:37:38,066 --> 02:37:41,736
"When the children wake up at night,
I'll look after them"

1548
02:37:42,070 --> 02:37:46,657
"I won't give you any trouble.
Please don't go away, Priya"

1549
02:37:48,076 --> 02:37:51,871
"If you go away,
it'll shatter my dream"

1550
02:37:54,791 --> 02:38:01,547
"Raj, I've had the same dreams.
The same dreams, Raj"

1551
02:38:05,885 --> 02:38:08,388
But reality is otherwise

1552
02:38:15,186 --> 02:38:18,106
O beloved...

1553
02:39:07,071 --> 02:39:11,367
"My loneliness, the ache
in my heart, never went away"

1554
02:39:11,951 --> 02:39:14,620
"The whole world
pokes at fun"

1555
02:39:18,082 --> 02:39:21,586
"You and I break up, my love..."

1556
02:39:22,962 --> 02:39:25,965
"like a star breaking away
from the skies"

1557
02:40:22,146 --> 02:40:24,899
"God, if I'm no more..."

1558
02:40:26,025 --> 02:40:28,027
look after Priya

1559
02:40:29,236 --> 02:40:34,492
Because I love Priya
very very much

1560
02:40:49,382 --> 02:40:54,261
"You are bidding me a farewell
and leaving me in God's care"

1561
02:40:55,012 --> 02:41:00,267
But you have broken my heart

1562
02:41:05,064 --> 02:41:08,609
"Broken hearts
are never put together again"

1563
02:41:11,070 --> 02:41:14,740
"You and I breaking up, my love..."

1564
02:41:16,283 --> 02:41:20,287
"like a star breaking away
from the skies"

1565
02:42:02,037 --> 02:42:05,332
"How often have I told you to keep
your shoes at the right place, Raj?"

1566
02:42:28,230 --> 02:42:31,358
"I couldn't go away, Raj.
I couldn't"

1567
02:42:35,654 --> 02:42:39,617
I can't live without you

1568
02:42:40,534 --> 02:42:47,541
"I realise, Raj, that I belong here.
In this house. With you"

1569
02:42:50,169 --> 02:42:54,882
And this talisman belongs
with you

1570
02:43:01,096 --> 02:43:04,642
"The dreams we saw
were the same, Raj"

1571
02:43:06,268 --> 02:43:09,480
And we can fulfill them
only by living together

1572
02:43:45,182 --> 02:43:48,560
"Promise me, Priya.
You will not leave me ever again"

1573
02:43:49,144 --> 02:43:51,271
And you must promise
never to shout at me again

1574
02:43:51,605 --> 02:43:54,108
"When do I...?
All right, I won't"

1575
02:43:54,441 --> 02:43:58,112
But why did you leave me and go away?
- You said such nasty things to me

1576
02:43:58,445 --> 02:44:01,699
"I know, but I went to Aunt Anna's
house to bring you back"

1577
02:44:02,074 --> 02:44:04,952
"Not to bring me back, to fight with me.
- That's what Aunt Anna says"

1578
02:44:05,577 --> 02:44:08,122
That's it! You get wrong
things in your mind!

1579
02:44:08,455 --> 02:44:10,249
I know what's on your mind right now!
- What?

1580
02:44:10,582 --> 02:44:12,584
When I'm picking up the shoes.
- No...

1581
02:44:13,502 --> 02:44:16,922
"All right, but did I say anything?
- No, but I understand"

1582
02:44:17,256 --> 02:44:19,133
This is love.
- This isn't love

1583
02:44:19,466 --> 02:44:22,010
"Shoes are where shoes should be,
and love is where love is"

1584
02:44:22,344 --> 02:44:25,806
So my love is a shoe?
- That's not what I said

1585
02:44:26,473 --> 02:44:27,808
Don't shout at me.
- Am I shouting?

1586
02:44:28,100 --> 02:44:31,270
You promised you wouldn't shout.
