1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,728
l want you to understand one thing:
Everything l teach you...

2
00:00:02,924 --> 00:00:04,899
...everything l have said to you...

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,969
...has been taught to me
by this dear man.

4
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:09,416
This divine man.

5
00:00:10,926 --> 00:00:14,273
All praise is due to Allah
for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

6
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:16,681
Attallah's fine.

7
00:00:16,877 --> 00:00:19,330
And she misses you as much as I do.

8
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:23,783
But the news that you've dedicated
four new temples is almost as good...

9
00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:27,208
...as having you with us.
Oh, dear heart.

10
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:32,008
--white supremacy, try to hide their
guilt by accusing Elijah Muhammad...

11
00:00:32,204 --> 00:00:33,764
...of being a black supremacist...

12
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:36,647
...simply because he's trying
to uplift the mentality...

13
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:39,560
...the social and economic condition
of his people.

14
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:43,682
And the Jews who have been guilty
of exploiting black people...

15
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:47,014
...try to hide their guilt
by accusing Elijah Muhammad...

16
00:00:47,243 --> 00:00:49,218
...of being anti-Semitic...

17
00:00:49,419 --> 00:00:52,681
...simply because he's trying
to teach you and l--

18
00:00:52,874 --> 00:00:54,782
He's trying to teach you and I...

19
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:58,020
...to be in charge of the businesses
in our own community.

20
00:00:58,217 --> 00:01:00,803
To own the businesses
in our own community.

21
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:03,556
To have economic leadership
in our own community.

22
00:01:04,424 --> 00:01:06,247
No, this isn't black supremacy...

23
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,709
...this is black intelligence.

25
00:01:24,907 --> 00:01:27,109
The black people in this country...

26
00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:29,799
...have been the victims
of violence...

27
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:32,768
...at the hands
of the American right wing...

28
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:35,968
...for 400 years.

29
00:01:36,358 --> 00:01:38,367
Four hundred years.

30
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:40,610
Four hundred years.

31
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:45,791
We thought by following
those ignorant Negro preachers...

32
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:48,356
...that it was God-like
to turn the other cheek...

33
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,939
...to the group
that was brutalizing us.

34
00:01:51,332 --> 00:01:54,878
A hundred years ago,
they used to put on white sheets...

35
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:57,117
...and sic bloodhounds on us.

36
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,622
Nowadays, they've traded in
the sheets--

37
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:01,472
Some have traded in the sheets--

38
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:04,732
They've traded in the sheets--

39
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:06,244
Please, please.

40
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:09,635
They've traded in those white sheets
for police uniforms.

41
00:02:09,957 --> 00:02:12,924
They traded in the bloodhounds
for police dogs.

42
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,676
Andjust like Uncle Tom
back during slavery time....

43
00:02:15,877 --> 00:02:20,189
We must remain true to nonviolence.
I'm asking everybody in the line.

44
00:02:20,518 --> 00:02:23,007
If you can't be nonviolent,
don't get in it.

45
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:26,077
--to love our enemy and pray
for those who use us spitefully.

46
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:30,269
You've got chicken-pecking Uncle Tom,
so-called Negro leaders today.

47
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:32,474
And it's another great day.

48
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:36,285
You've got these Uncle Tom
Negro leaders today...

49
00:02:36,483 --> 00:02:38,972
...that tell us we ought to pray
for our enemies.

50
00:02:39,173 --> 00:02:42,106
We ought to love our enemy
and integrate with the enemy...

51
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:45,757
...who bombs us, who kills
and shoots us, who lynches us...

52
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:48,736
...who rapes our women
and children. No!

53
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,986
No! That's not intelligent.

54
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:54,974
That's not intelligent.

55
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:57,756
Elijah Muhammad is trying
to teach you and l...

56
00:02:57,954 --> 00:03:01,152
...that just as the white man
and any other man on this earth...

57
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:04,641
...has the God-given right,
the human right, the civil right...

58
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:07,652
...the natural right, and any other
rights you can think of...

59
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:09,534
...to protect himself...

60
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:13,146
...just as this white man has
the right to defend himself...

61
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:16,029
...we have the right
to defend ourselves too.

62
00:03:16,577 --> 00:03:20,769
This is only natural. This is what
Elijah Muhammad is trying to teach.

63
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,869
He's not teaching us
to hate the white man.

64
00:03:23,073 --> 00:03:25,462
He's teaching us to love ourselves.

65
00:03:26,594 --> 00:03:30,456
Mr. X, before we begin
our discussion tonight...

66
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:33,855
... "The Black Muslims: Hate Mongers"...

67
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,943
...would you mind explaining for us
the meaning of your name...

68
00:03:38,144 --> 00:03:40,478
...which is the letter "X"?

69
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,839
During slavery time,
the slave master...

70
00:03:44,031 --> 00:03:46,456
...gave the Negro--
the so-called Negro...

71
00:03:46,657 --> 00:03:49,689
...named the so-called Negro
after themselves.

72
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:52,411
Elijah Muhammad teaches us...

73
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:56,152
...that once we come into the knowledge
of lslam, the knowledge of ourselves...

74
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:58,870
...we replace our slave name
with an "X" ...

75
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,855
..."X" in mathematics representing
the unknown.

76
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:05,078
Since we've been disconnected,
or cut off from our own history...

77
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,127
...our own past, our own culture,
our own land...

78
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,898
...we use the "X," the unknown,
until we get back to our country.

79
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:15,223
l see. Thank you. Dr. Payson?

80
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,976
Mr. X is a....
He's a demagogue.

81
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:20,823
He has no place to go,
so he exaggerates.

82
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:22,233
He's a disservice to...

83
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:26,108
...every good, law-abiding, church-going
American Negro in the country.

84
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:33,013
Why do you teach black supremacy?

85
00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:35,067
Why do you teach hate?

86
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,627
Well, for the white man...

87
00:04:37,822 --> 00:04:40,188
...to ask the black man...

88
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:42,043
...why he hates him...

89
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:46,010
...is like the wolf asking the sheep,
or the rapist asking the raped...

90
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,187
..."Do you hate me?"

91
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:50,871
The white man is in no moral position
to accuse the black man of anything.

92
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:52,955
This is a black man
asking the question.

93
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:57,143
What would you call an educated Negro
with a B. A., an M. A., a B. S. or a Ph. D.?

94
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,655
You call him a nigger.
That's what the white man calls him.

95
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:02,963
You have to understand this thinking.

96
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:06,645
To understand this type of man,
you must understand that historically...

97
00:05:06,842 --> 00:05:10,357
...there were two types of slaves:
The house Negro and the field Negro.

98
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:12,279
The house Negro lived in the house...

99
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:15,988
...next to his master. ln the big house,
in the basement or the attic.

100
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:18,838
He dressed good, he ate good,
what the master left him.

101
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:20,593
He loved his master.

102
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:23,861
He loved his master better
than the master loved himself.

103
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:28,183
lf master said, "We got a nice house,"
you say, "Yeah, we got a nice house."

104
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:30,808
Master's house caught on fire,
the house Negro...

105
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:32,470
...would put the blaze out.

106
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:35,865
lf the master got sick, he'd say,
"What's the matter? We sick?"

107
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,802
"We sick" ! This is the thinking
of the house Negro.

108
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:40,660
lf another slave said...

109
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:43,608
..."Let's run away, let's separate
from this cruel master" ...

110
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,616
...he said, "Why? What's better
than what we got here?

111
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:49,146
l'm not going anywhere."
This is the house Negro.

112
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:51,094
ln those days, we called them
house niggers.

113
00:05:51,288 --> 00:05:55,182
That's what we call them today because
we still got a lot of house niggers.

114
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,201
Dear Holy Apostle...

115
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:02,101
...the ministers think Malcolm is
getting too much press.

116
00:06:03,354 --> 00:06:05,871
They think he thinks he is
the Nation of lslam.

117
00:06:07,673 --> 00:06:10,226
That he has aspirations
to lead the Nation.

118
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:14,039
lt was you who made Malcolm
the man he is.

119
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,662
You lifted him out of darkness.

120
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:21,648
You go and tell the brothers...

121
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:24,016
...that what the Brother Minister...

122
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,165
...is doing, has done...

123
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:30,677
...has been of great benefit
to the Nation.

124
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,779
And you tell them that l say so.

125
00:06:32,984 --> 00:06:35,503
The ministers think he is
of great benefit to himself.

126
00:06:44,886 --> 00:06:45,712
One at a time.

127
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:48,845
-Did you say white people are devils?
-I said they're devils.

128
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:50,737
Should all black men be armed?

129
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:53,203
Well, one of your most
famous men said:

130
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:56,780
"Praise the Lord and pass the
ammunition." That's the way you think.

131
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:59,218
Do you think your cause
will be successful?

132
00:06:59,412 --> 00:07:00,689
I sincerely hope so.

133
00:07:00,885 --> 00:07:03,090
-Do you advocate violence?
-No, sir.

134
00:07:03,286 --> 00:07:05,388
Has a white man helped your people?

135
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,042
Has there been a white man
that's helped my people?

136
00:07:08,244 --> 00:07:10,350
-Correct.
-I don't understand the question.

137
00:07:10,549 --> 00:07:12,619
You preach anti-white,
anti-Christian science.

138
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,641
You're saying you're anti-white?

139
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:17,684
-No, you're saying it.
-Are all white people devils?

140
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:21,611
We've gotta move out.
We've got a plane to catch.

141
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:26,320
Excuse me, Mr. X?

142
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:28,818
l've read some of your speeches...

143
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:32,590
...and l honestly believe that a lot
of what you have to say is true.

144
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:35,721
l'm a good person in spite
of what my ancestors did.

145
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,896
l just wanted to ask you...

146
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:40,849
...what can a white person
like me, who isn't prejudiced...

147
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:44,460
...what can l do to help you
and further your cause?

148
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:45,704
Nothing.

149
00:07:52,944 --> 00:07:55,247
My high school was a black ghetto...

150
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:57,516
...in Roxbury, right here in Boston.

151
00:07:58,322 --> 00:08:01,770
I got my college education on
the streets of Harlem in New York City.

152
00:08:02,578 --> 00:08:05,001
l took my master's degree in prison...

153
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:06,919
...over six and a half years.

154
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:08,300
ln fact...

155
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:12,009
...my old burglary hangout
was just outside this campus.

156
00:08:12,755 --> 00:08:14,161
l lived like an animal.

157
00:08:15,058 --> 00:08:16,399
l stole.

158
00:08:16,723 --> 00:08:18,444
l used drugs.

159
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,309
l smoked reefers, cocaine.

160
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:26,157
l committed adultery. Had it not been
for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad...

161
00:08:26,894 --> 00:08:29,613
...l'd have surely been in
an insane asylum or dead...

162
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,426
...or possibly even a murderer
of one of you.

163
00:08:32,622 --> 00:08:36,682
So what is Mr. Muhammad trying to do?
He's trying to get us on God's side...

164
00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:40,424
...so that God will be on our side
and help us fight our battles.

165
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:43,342
When the so-called Negro in America
gets on God's side...

166
00:08:43,535 --> 00:08:46,023
...and listens to the teachings
of Elijah Muhammad...

167
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:49,519
...he'll want to get off of drugs
and get away from a life of crime.

168
00:08:49,711 --> 00:08:52,265
He'll want to get away
from committing adultery.

169
00:08:52,462 --> 00:08:55,244
Then he'd want to get off welfare.
He'd want a job...

170
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:58,854
...to take care of his family.
And his family would respect him.

171
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:01,421
His son will say,
"l'm proud that that's my father."

172
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:04,232
His wife will say,
"l'm proud that that's my husband."

173
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,871
"Father" only means that you take care
of your children. That's what it is.

174
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:11,940
"Father" doesn't mean
that you're having some babies.

175
00:09:12,142 --> 00:09:13,635
That doesn't make you a father.

176
00:09:13,838 --> 00:09:15,528
Anybody can go out and get a woman.

177
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:18,572
But not anybody can take care
of that woman.

178
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:21,384
There's another word for it.
lt's called responsibility.

179
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:26,210
lf the so-called Negro in America
was truly an American citizen...

180
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:28,299
...we wouldn't have a racial problem.

181
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,428
lf the Emancipation Proclamation
was authentic...

182
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,151
...if the 13th, 14th and 15th
amendments...

183
00:09:34,348 --> 00:09:36,968
...were authentic,
we wouldn't have a race problem.

184
00:09:37,196 --> 00:09:40,043
lf the Supreme Court desegregation
decision were authentic...

185
00:09:40,236 --> 00:09:41,664
...we wouldn't have a race problem.

186
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,249
But you have to see
that all of this is hypocrisy.

187
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,071
These Negro leaders are telling
the white man...

188
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:50,986
...that everything's all right,
we got it under control.

189
00:09:51,178 --> 00:09:53,735
That everything Elijah Muhammad
teaches is wrong.

190
00:09:53,932 --> 00:09:57,279
Mr. Muhammad said these things
were gonna come to pass...

191
00:09:57,484 --> 00:09:59,273
...and now they're coming to pass.

192
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:04,548
Now these same Negro leaders...

193
00:10:05,644 --> 00:10:10,082
...are running around talking about
there's about to be a racial explosion.

194
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:14,403
Yes, there's gonna be
a racial explosion.

195
00:10:14,858 --> 00:10:19,199
And a racial explosion is
more dangerous than an atomic explosion.

196
00:10:20,811 --> 00:10:24,771
There's going to be an explosion because
black people are dissatisfied...

197
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:28,994
...not only with the white man, but with
these Uncle Tom Negro leaders...

198
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:30,983
...that try to pose
as spokesmen...

199
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:32,585
...for you and l.

200
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:34,147
Just like you have a--

201
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:36,580
Just like you have a powder keg.

202
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:39,359
When you have a powder keg
and there's too many sparks...

203
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,122
...the thing's going to explode.

204
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,932
lf the thing that's going to explode
is sitting inside the house...

205
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,998
...and if it explodes, then the house
is going to be destroyed.

206
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,916
l said the house is going
to be destroyed.

207
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:53,569
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is
teaching you and l...

208
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:57,565
...and trying to tell the white man
to get this powder keg out of his house.

209
00:10:57,897 --> 00:11:00,131
Let the black man separate
from his house.

210
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,244
Let the black man have his own house.

211
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:05,090
Let the black man have
his own land and property.

212
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,747
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is
trying to tell the white man...

213
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,727
...that this thing, this explosion, is
gonna bring down his house.

214
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:18,236
This is what he's telling him.
More importantly, he's telling him...

215
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:20,347
...that if he doesn't do
something about it...

216
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:25,286
...if he doesn't do something about it,
it's gonna explode any day now.

217
00:11:25,606 --> 00:11:28,738
l'm just here to tell you,
and l'm gonna make it very short.

218
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:33,028
l'm here to tell you about
Elijah Muhammad's greatest greatness.

219
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,448
His greatest greatness is
that he has the only solution...

220
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:38,620
...for peace in this country.

221
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:41,436
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad's
solution...

222
00:11:41,637 --> 00:11:43,676
...is the only solution for you and l.

223
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:46,397
lt's the only solution
for the white man.

224
00:11:47,588 --> 00:11:49,924
Complete separation...

225
00:11:50,245 --> 00:11:53,593
...between the black race
and the white race.

226
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:57,888
lt's the only solution.

227
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:06,143
All praise due to Allah
for Elijah Muhammad!

228
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:08,576
All praise due to Allah
for Elijah Muhammad!

229
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:44,635
Brother Malcolm!

230
00:12:45,443 --> 00:12:48,060
Yes, yes. Hold on, hold on.

231
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:52,028
Yes, sir. lt's all right.
My brother. How you doing?

232
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:54,198
-Can l ask you something?
-Anything.

233
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,126
Are you Elijah's pimp?

234
00:12:56,323 --> 00:12:58,874
He should be killed
for talking like that!

235
00:13:00,065 --> 00:13:01,592
What are you saying, brother?

236
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,642
"His greatest greatness."

237
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:05,531
Just say what you're saying.

238
00:13:07,265 --> 00:13:08,891
lf you don't know...

239
00:13:09,216 --> 00:13:10,558
...l feel the sorriest for you.

240
00:13:10,754 --> 00:13:12,694
Oh, come on, brother.

241
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:15,515
Let me tell you something.

242
00:13:24,257 --> 00:13:25,498
lt's all right.

243
00:13:29,437 --> 00:13:31,858
He's just hungry for knowledge,
that's all.

244
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,133
Yeah, that brother's starving.

245
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:37,015
So am l. Come on,
let's get something to eat.

246
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,119
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

247
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,740
-Okay, night-night, Daddy.
-Night-night.

248
00:13:57,663 --> 00:13:58,805
Long night.

249
00:14:05,726 --> 00:14:07,451
-What you looking at?
-You.

250
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,052
Why you looking like that?

251
00:14:09,245 --> 00:14:10,456
You're in trouble.

252
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:13,553
How do you know?

253
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:15,728
Oh, dear heart.

254
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:17,592
Because l know you.

255
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:19,415
Well, if you know me...

256
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:23,929
...you know l don't like to bring
my troubles home.

257
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:26,929
You know that also.

258
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:30,772
Yes, l do.

259
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:35,123
But l'm not made of glass.

260
00:14:35,325 --> 00:14:37,235
And l won't break.

261
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:46,551
Look, Betty, l just want peace.

262
00:14:48,028 --> 00:14:50,198
l want to sit here with you.
l want to...

263
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:54,384
...be still. l want peace in my house.

264
00:14:57,912 --> 00:15:00,533
-Have we ever had a fight?
-Never.

265
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:02,998
-Argument?
-Never had one, no.

266
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:07,314
We're gonna have one...

267
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:11,153
-...if you don't talk about it.
-Talk about what?

268
00:15:11,354 --> 00:15:15,380
-The talk's everywhere.
-There's always gonna be talk.

269
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:18,773
Aren't they talking now about me trying
to take over the Nation?

270
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:21,969
Aren't they talking about
how we're getting rich...

271
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,924
...off the Nation of lslam?

272
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,772
-We could talk about that too.
-Let's talk about it.

273
00:15:27,162 --> 00:15:28,883
lt's not just talk anymore.

274
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,342
"UPl: Elijah Muhammad, 67...

275
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:35,189
...leader of
the Black Muslim movement...

276
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:39,539
...today faced paternity suits
from two former secretaries."

277
00:15:39,736 --> 00:15:42,998
These are slanders. These are lies.
Don't you know that?

278
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:47,085
Don't you realize this is
the devil's newspaper?

279
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,390
He's trying to divide us.

280
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:53,871
Divide and conquer. He's trying
to bring down our leader.

281
00:15:57,177 --> 00:15:58,451
"Both women...

282
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:02,733
...in their 20s, charge that
they had intimacy--"

283
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:05,684
"lntimacies with Mr. Muhammad--"

284
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,452
You think l'm not
aware of these accusations?

285
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:20,851
You think l'm not
aware of these vicious lies?

286
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:25,969
-Brother Baines and l discussed it today.
-Baines?

287
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,694
ls he your friend?

288
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:28,720
What's wrong?

289
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:31,285
Nothing.
What's the matter with you?

290
00:16:31,477 --> 00:16:34,892
Wake up! Are you so committed that
you've blinded yourself?

291
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:37,775
You're so dedicated,
you can't face the truth?

292
00:16:37,975 --> 00:16:39,184
Baines?

293
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:42,706
He's the editor of the newspaper
that you established.

294
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,056
Ask him why your name hasn't
appeared in it for over a year.

295
00:16:47,252 --> 00:16:50,731
-l'm not interested in publicity.
-You're in every other paper.

296
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,028
Our people know what l'm doing.

297
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:57,128
-But do you know what Baines is doing?
-Baines! Baines!

298
00:16:57,331 --> 00:17:01,160
You're so blind!
Everyone can see but you!

299
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:06,067
Baines is the one who saved my life.

300
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,462
When l crawled in prison
like an animal...

301
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,179
...he brought me to
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

302
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:13,866
And Mr. Muhammad brought me
back from the dead--

303
00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:16,010
A long time ago!
You've repaid them!

304
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:18,797
Don't you raise your voice
in my house!

305
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,520
Ask them.

306
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:28,653
Ask them why they have new cars,
houses and furniture.

307
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:31,303
ls that what this is about?
You want furniture?

308
00:17:31,506 --> 00:17:33,707
-You want cars?
-What do we have?

309
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:35,811
What do we have, Malcolm?

310
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:38,055
Broken-down jalopy....

311
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,975
The clothes on our backs.

312
00:17:41,296 --> 00:17:42,954
So l'll get you new clothes....

313
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:45,540
We don't even own our own home.

314
00:17:45,746 --> 00:17:48,559
What about our children?
What about me?

315
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:50,822
We don't even own life insurance.

316
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:54,255
The Nation will support all of you
if anything happens to me--

317
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:55,396
Will they?

318
00:17:56,527 --> 00:17:57,740
Are you sure?

319
00:17:59,249 --> 00:18:00,526
Are you sure?

320
00:18:01,485 --> 00:18:02,765
Are you sure?

321
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:05,961
Or are you blind?

322
00:18:09,328 --> 00:18:10,277
All right.

323
00:18:15,982 --> 00:18:17,805
l've got work to do, so....

324
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:21,314
There's always work to do.

325
00:18:21,581 --> 00:18:23,306
-Help me.
-l'm trying to.

326
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:26,885
l'm raising the children
practically by myself.

327
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:29,606
What do you want me to do?
Stay home?

328
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:33,102
You don't know how often they ask,
"Where's Daddy?"

329
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:35,845
You want me to make the beds
and go on the road?

330
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:37,702
-The people need me!
-We need you!

331
00:18:37,901 --> 00:18:40,487
l need you too.
But what do you want me to do?

332
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:42,694
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

333
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:47,687
You can face death 24 hours a day,
but the possibility of betrayal...

334
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:49,955
...never enters your head.

335
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,923
Open your eyes.

336
00:19:29,993 --> 00:19:32,776
-As-Salaam-Alaikum, minister
-Alaikum-Salaam, sister.

337
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,858
Her name's Eva Marie.

338
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:37,346
And she's 2 years old.

339
00:19:38,856 --> 00:19:41,510
Brother Minister,
l didn't do anything wrong.

340
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:44,704
l didn't do anything to be
put in isolation.

341
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:47,590
l believed in him.

342
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,232
l believed in
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

343
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,328
Believe in Allah.

344
00:19:59,754 --> 00:20:01,892
This is Saudi.
She's 2.

345
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:04,105
And you have Lisha.
She's 3.

346
00:20:04,295 --> 00:20:08,836
From their own mouths I heard
who had fathered their children.

347
00:20:09,353 --> 00:20:12,135
And from their own mouths
I heard that Mr. Muhammad...

348
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:14,369
...had told them I was the best.

349
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:17,565
He often spoke of you.
He loves you like a son.

350
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,833
The greatest minister he had,
but that I would leave him...

351
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:24,164
...turn against him.
And so I was dangerous.

352
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,972
Mr. Muhammad, while praising me
to my face...

353
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,852
...was tearing me apart
behind by back.

354
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,315
-You're sure about all this?
-Yes, l am.

355
00:20:33,544 --> 00:20:36,128
All l want is support for
my three children...

356
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:39,485
...that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad
provide for them.

357
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:41,472
That's all l want.

358
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:45,787
Allah will provide...

359
00:20:49,318 --> 00:20:50,300
...for all of us.

360
00:20:50,535 --> 00:20:52,390
What do you mean, blackout?

361
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:54,853
Perhaps some brothers are
a little jealous.

362
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,655
Maybe they think you've been
getting too much press.

363
00:20:58,852 --> 00:21:00,413
lt's nothing. Forget it.

364
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:03,066
Now about our coming
up in the world a little.

365
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:06,139
The Nation's grown.
We've grown with it.

366
00:21:07,078 --> 00:21:08,538
You know our people.

367
00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:12,193
They want their leaders
to be prosperous.

368
00:21:13,254 --> 00:21:14,976
One hand washes the other.

369
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:18,622
"l'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle."

370
00:21:20,997 --> 00:21:22,972
Remember what you told me in prison?

371
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:26,849
"l'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle."

372
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,885
Brother Malcolm...

373
00:21:32,803 --> 00:21:35,073
...what do you want?
A new car?

374
00:21:35,654 --> 00:21:37,027
A new house?

375
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,058
lt's the money, isn't it?

376
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:48,673
But we tell the whole world that
we're moral leaders...

377
00:21:48,995 --> 00:21:50,682
...because we follow...

378
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,817
...the personal example of
Mr. Muhammad.

379
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:56,057
Elijah Muhammad is a human being...

380
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,140
...and so are you.

381
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:00,733
-Do you know your Bible?
-Do you?

382
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:02,944
David slept with Bathsheba...

383
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:05,408
...but he's remembered for
slaying Goliath.

384
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:10,838
Noah was accused of drunkenness,
but God gave him the ark.

385
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:16,571
Solomon had 700 wives, but he
was history's greatest, wisest king.

386
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:20,348
Brother Baines is a two-bit hustler,
but one hand washes the other.

387
00:22:20,546 --> 00:22:23,360
A great man's deeds
outweigh his personal weaknesses.

388
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,787
Who needs the nutmeg now, brother?

389
00:22:25,985 --> 00:22:28,407
-l'm not gonna allow--
-Be careful, Malcolm.

390
00:22:30,306 --> 00:22:31,644
l warn you.

391
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:33,784
You be careful.

392
00:23:01,951 --> 00:23:03,922
l'm not surprised.

393
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:11,675
You have a very good understanding of
prophecy, of spiritual matters.

394
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,846
l'm not surprised.

395
00:23:14,431 --> 00:23:17,016
l have built this Nation...

396
00:23:17,212 --> 00:23:20,378
...under the divine guidance of Allah.

397
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,925
He has brought me back
from the dead to lead my people.

398
00:23:25,115 --> 00:23:27,417
After me,
there will be no more.

399
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,302
No more.

400
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:34,905
l must...

401
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:39,960
...plant my seed in fertile soil.

402
00:23:40,188 --> 00:23:41,564
lt is only...

403
00:23:42,205 --> 00:23:45,075
...the fulfillment of prophecy.

404
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:49,143
My faith had been shattered
in a way I can never fully describe.

405
00:23:49,373 --> 00:23:52,024
Every second of my 12 years
with Mr. Muhammad...

406
00:23:52,217 --> 00:23:54,608
...I'd been ready to die for him.

407
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,292
The thing to me that is worse than
death itself is betrayal.

408
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:02,234
I could conceive death,
but I couldn't conceive betrayal.

409
00:24:02,428 --> 00:24:06,649
Not of the loyalty I gave to
the Nation of Islam and Mr. Muhammad.

410
00:24:06,907 --> 00:24:10,068
During that time, if Mr. Muhammad
had committed any crime...

411
00:24:10,264 --> 00:24:13,974
...punishable by death, I would
have tried to prove I did it...

412
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:15,413
...to save him.

413
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:18,871
I would have gladly gone
to the electric chair in his place.

414
00:24:34,584 --> 00:24:36,080
What did he say?

415
00:24:43,096 --> 00:24:46,262
-l'm so sorry.
-There's nothing to be sorry about.

416
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:49,456
l just got a lot of work to do,
that's all.

417
00:24:53,401 --> 00:24:54,710
How can you work?

418
00:24:54,904 --> 00:24:57,041
Because we have to teach.

419
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,038
We gotta teach the people.
We gotta teach on Solomon, Moses...

420
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:04,182
...David.
Solomon had 700 wives.

421
00:25:04,376 --> 00:25:07,637
A man's good deeds,
they far outweigh any of his....

422
00:25:08,953 --> 00:25:10,893
My father used to say that...

423
00:25:11,605 --> 00:25:14,224
...you can't make a rooster stop
crowing after sunrise.

424
00:25:14,423 --> 00:25:16,015
Well, the sun is up.

425
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:42,610
So what do l say about this
so-called national day of mourning?

426
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:46,317
l say the white man's acts of violence
should be condemned...

427
00:25:46,516 --> 00:25:48,373
...by our beliefs and by his own.

428
00:25:48,568 --> 00:25:51,250
The lKoran teaches us that
those who work evil...

429
00:25:51,702 --> 00:25:55,976
...will be condemned, punished
or judged according to their works.

430
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:59,247
The Holy Bible teaches us that
you reap what you sow.

431
00:25:59,442 --> 00:26:00,850
This is divinejustice.

432
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:04,721
ln the Americas' soil, the white man
has planted seeds of hatred...

433
00:26:04,915 --> 00:26:06,739
...the seeds of violence.

434
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:09,418
He's allowed those weeds to choke...

435
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:13,034
...the lives of millions of black men
and women for 400 years...

436
00:26:13,236 --> 00:26:16,398
...and the lives of lndians in these
Americas for 500 years.

437
00:26:16,594 --> 00:26:18,604
And now those same weeds...

438
00:26:18,803 --> 00:26:21,617
...have choked his own chief gardener.

439
00:26:21,811 --> 00:26:24,909
You ask me what l say.
l only say what the Bible says.

440
00:26:25,172 --> 00:26:27,341
l say what the lKoran says.

441
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,677
l say it's justice.

442
00:26:34,322 --> 00:26:39,055
Don't you even feel a bit remorseful
or saddened by lKennedy's assassination?

443
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,733
l don't think anyone would deny that
when you send chickens...

444
00:26:42,931 --> 00:26:44,654
...out from the barnyard...

445
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:48,232
...those chickens will return to
your barnyard, not your neighbor's.

446
00:26:48,435 --> 00:26:51,630
lt's an example of the devil's
chickens coming home to roost.

447
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:54,729
The violence that he's
perpetrated here and abroad...

448
00:26:54,928 --> 00:26:58,705
...four children in Birmingham,
or Medgar Evers, or in Africa...

449
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:01,287
...this same violence has claimed
one of their own.

450
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:05,230
Being a farm boy, chickens coming home
to roost never made me sad.

451
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:07,367
ln fact, it's only made me glad.

452
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,482
Did you...

453
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:20,837
...read the paper today?

454
00:27:23,504 --> 00:27:25,097
Yes, sir. l did.

455
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:32,972
That was a bad statement you made.

456
00:27:35,023 --> 00:27:38,503
You knew from my instructions...

457
00:27:38,768 --> 00:27:43,500
...no minister was to make
any statements against this man.

458
00:27:43,693 --> 00:27:46,114
The country loved this man.

459
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:48,202
You have made it...

460
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:49,735
...hard...

461
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,133
...for Muslims...

462
00:27:52,493 --> 00:27:54,283
...in general.

463
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,766
Yes, sir.

464
00:27:57,964 --> 00:28:02,571
We must disassociate ourselves...

465
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,968
...from your terrible blunder.

466
00:28:07,406 --> 00:28:09,316
l must silence you.

467
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,723
For 90 days...

468
00:28:14,765 --> 00:28:18,695
...you must not make any statements
to the press...

469
00:28:19,405 --> 00:28:23,558
...nor are you to speak
at any temples.

470
00:28:24,842 --> 00:28:25,954
Yes, sir.

471
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,281
Yes, sir.
l submit 100 percent.

472
00:29:26,344 --> 00:29:27,390
Leave us alone.

473
00:29:28,424 --> 00:29:30,564
Leave us alone.
Stop calling here.

474
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,057
Who's putting you up to this?
We have children here!

475
00:29:34,342 --> 00:29:35,719
Stop it!

476
00:29:47,974 --> 00:29:49,250
lt's all right.

477
00:29:49,735 --> 00:29:51,328
They keep calling!

478
00:29:52,453 --> 00:29:54,210
They keep calling!

479
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,925
Just...

480
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,534
...take the babies and put them to bed.

481
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:04,449
Come on, babies.
Let's go to bed now.

482
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:06,527
-Bedtime.
-Come on.

483
00:30:07,078 --> 00:30:08,027
Let's go.

484
00:30:09,702 --> 00:30:13,148
-Good night, Mommy.
-Good night, Daddy.

485
00:30:27,781 --> 00:30:30,367
Brother Minister,
l have to level with you.

486
00:30:31,171 --> 00:30:33,081
They gave me a mission...

487
00:30:33,476 --> 00:30:34,819
...but l couldn't do it.

488
00:30:35,845 --> 00:30:38,301
-l love you all.
-What kind of mission?

489
00:30:40,998 --> 00:30:42,885
To wire your car...

490
00:30:43,076 --> 00:30:45,314
...so it would explode...

491
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:47,904
...when you turned the ignition.

492
00:30:49,155 --> 00:30:52,984
The ministers say you're spreading
untruths about Mr. Muhammad.

493
00:30:53,412 --> 00:30:56,162
They say that
you're the greatest hypocrite...

494
00:30:56,353 --> 00:30:57,783
...a Judas...

495
00:30:58,177 --> 00:31:00,034
...a Benedict Arnold.

496
00:31:01,378 --> 00:31:04,826
The ministers say that
your tongue should be cut out...

497
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:08,414
...and delivered
to Mr. Muhammad's doorstep.

498
00:31:09,122 --> 00:31:10,781
And what do you say?

499
00:31:10,977 --> 00:31:12,637
l'm with you, Brother Minister.

500
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:14,240
You'll be marked for death.

501
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:15,962
Yes, sir.

502
00:31:16,996 --> 00:31:17,976
Let me die then.

503
00:31:30,914 --> 00:31:33,018
l can't come between you
and your father.

504
00:31:33,472 --> 00:31:35,644
-You're my father.
-Go on home.

505
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:39,703
Don't come back.
That's an order.

506
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:48,534
Yes, sir.

507
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:04,192
Because 1964 threatens to be an
explosive year on the racial front...

508
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:08,824
...l have called this press conference
to clarify my position.

509
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:12,892
lnternal differences have forced me
out of the Nation of lslam.

510
00:32:13,088 --> 00:32:16,949
ln the past, l thought and spoke
the words of Elijah Muhammad.

511
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,971
Everything l said,
l started with:

512
00:32:19,168 --> 00:32:22,330
"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us" thus-and-so.

513
00:32:22,593 --> 00:32:24,153
That day is over.

514
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,896
From now on l speak my own words,
and l think my own thoughts.

515
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:30,711
Now that I have
more independence of action...

516
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:34,170
...I'll use a more flexible approach
in working with others...

517
00:32:34,367 --> 00:32:35,925
...to solve this problem.

518
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:38,330
l'm not out to fight
other Negro leaders.

519
00:32:38,526 --> 00:32:41,840
l"ve forgotten every bad thing
other leaders said about me...

520
00:32:42,046 --> 00:32:45,688
...and l pray they'll forget the many
bad things l said about them.

521
00:32:45,884 --> 00:32:49,779
We must work together to find a common
solution to a common problem.

522
00:32:50,303 --> 00:32:53,082
I will organize
and lead a new mosque in New York:

523
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:54,901
Muslim Mosque, Incorporated.

524
00:32:55,325 --> 00:32:58,675
This gives us the religious base
and the spiritual force...

525
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:01,398
...necessary to rid our people
of the vices...

526
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:03,864
...that destroy
our community's moral fiber.

527
00:33:04,061 --> 00:33:06,330
Our politics
will be Black Nationalism...

528
00:33:06,524 --> 00:33:09,456
...meaning, we want to control
our community's politics.

529
00:33:09,661 --> 00:33:11,995
The Muslim Mosque, lnc.
will remain open...

530
00:33:12,187 --> 00:33:15,321
...for ideas and financial aid
from all quarters.

531
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,685
Whites can help us,
but they can't join us.

532
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:22,222
There can't be black-white unity
until there's first black unity.

533
00:33:22,489 --> 00:33:24,051
We can't unite with others...

534
00:33:24,249 --> 00:33:27,034
...until we've first learned
to unite amongst ourselves.

535
00:33:27,226 --> 00:33:29,267
We can't be acceptable to others...

536
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:32,086
...until we have first
proven acceptable to ourselves.

537
00:33:32,282 --> 00:33:35,630
In my desire to fully understand
the religion of Islam...

538
00:33:35,835 --> 00:33:39,764
...as practiced by 750 million
Muslims around the world...

539
00:33:39,963 --> 00:33:44,185
...I intend to make a pilgrimage,
or holyjourney, to Mecca.

540
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:47,026
This pilgrimage is
a religious requirement...

541
00:33:47,224 --> 00:33:49,680
...or duty,
of every Muslim that is able...

542
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,493
...to make the pilgrimage
at least once in his lifetime.

543
00:34:06,874 --> 00:34:08,399
l'm Egyptian. And you?

544
00:34:08,698 --> 00:34:09,743
American.

545
00:34:09,946 --> 00:34:10,958
What's your name?

546
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:13,366
Malcolm.

547
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:29,136
-How much?
-Twenty Egyptian pounds.

548
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,056
For one?

549
00:34:31,253 --> 00:34:33,524
-Special price for you.
-Special for me!

550
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:36,980
Okay, thank you.
Where can l get a better price?

551
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,053
-What's your name?
-Mohammed.

552
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,739
Mohammed, l'm Malcolm.

553
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:49,227
-Malcolm X. And you?
-Gamaal.

554
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:53,258
All right, Gamaal. l'm from Harlem.
From the United States.

555
00:34:54,997 --> 00:34:57,845
-Hareem?
-No, not Hareem. Harlem.

556
00:34:58,037 --> 00:34:59,825
Can you show me around?

557
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,410
-Hash?
-No. No hashish.

558
00:35:04,342 --> 00:35:05,802
You know, the pyramids.

559
00:35:06,676 --> 00:35:09,063
No, pyramids, pyramids, pyramids.

560
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:15,954
You're gonna take me?

561
00:35:17,237 --> 00:35:19,342
Sphinx! Sphinx!

562
00:36:37,456 --> 00:36:39,115
My darling Betty:

563
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:43,429
Everywhere I go, I am welcomed
as a representative of our people.

564
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:46,825
Our struggle is known
and respected worldwide.

565
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:50,922
Coincidentally, two white men
follow me around wherever I go.

566
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,134
I wonder who they're working for?

567
00:36:53,616 --> 00:36:55,982
If I was a betting man,
I'd say the CIA.

568
00:36:56,174 --> 00:36:57,288
What's your guess?

569
00:36:58,255 --> 00:37:00,196
Today I arrived in Arabia.

570
00:37:00,815 --> 00:37:04,557
I have never witnessed
such sincere hospitality...

571
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,759
...and true brotherhood...

572
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:08,519
...as practiced here...

573
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,849
...in the ancient
home ofAbraham, Mohammed...

574
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:15,432
...and the great prophets
of the Scriptures. "

575
00:37:21,454 --> 00:37:23,909
Today, with thousands of others...

576
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:27,526
...I proclaimed God's greatness
in the sacred city of Mecca.

577
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:31,851
In the ihram garb, I made
my seven circuits around the Kaaba.

578
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,634
I drank from the well of Zem Zem.

579
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,702
I prayed to Allah from Mount Arafat.

580
00:37:37,996 --> 00:37:41,738
It was the only time in my life that
I stood before the Creator...

581
00:37:41,932 --> 00:37:44,321
...and felt
like a complete human being.

582
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:06,145
Now, you may be shocked
by these words...

583
00:38:06,348 --> 00:38:10,057
...but I've eaten from the same plate,
drunk from the same glass...

584
00:38:10,252 --> 00:38:14,080
...and prayed to the same God
with Muslims whose eyes were blue...

585
00:38:14,284 --> 00:38:18,374
...whose hair was blond, and whose
skin was the whitest of white.

586
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:20,227
And we were all brothers...

587
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,408
...truly.

588
00:38:21,611 --> 00:38:26,346
People of all colors and races
believing in one God, in one humanity.

589
00:38:40,073 --> 00:38:42,213
Each hour in this sacred land
gives me...

590
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:45,855
...greater spiritual insight into
what is happening in America.

591
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:50,373
The American Negro can never
be blamed for his racial animosities.

592
00:38:50,571 --> 00:38:54,365
He's only reacting to 400 years of
oppression and discrimination.

593
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,884
But as racism leads America
up the suicidal path...

594
00:38:58,089 --> 00:39:01,566
...I believe the younger generation
will see the writing on the wall...

595
00:39:01,768 --> 00:39:05,031
...and many will want to turn to
the spiritual path of truth...

596
00:39:05,222 --> 00:39:07,843
...the only way left to ward off
the disaster...

597
00:39:08,038 --> 00:39:09,928
...that racism must surely lead to.

598
00:39:10,823 --> 00:39:14,784
Once before, in prison,
the truth came and blinded me.

599
00:39:15,848 --> 00:39:17,473
Well, it has happened again.

600
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:21,852
In the past, I've made sweeping
indictments of all white people.

601
00:39:22,087 --> 00:39:24,608
And these generalizations
have caused injuries...

602
00:39:24,804 --> 00:39:27,194
...to some whites
who didn't deserve them.

603
00:39:28,262 --> 00:39:32,091
"Because of the spiritual rebirth
which l was blessed to undergo...

604
00:39:32,295 --> 00:39:34,367
...as a result of my pilgrimage...

605
00:39:34,565 --> 00:39:36,575
...to the holy city of Mecca...

606
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:41,888
...l no longer subscribe
to sweeping indictments of one race.

607
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,522
I intend...

608
00:39:44,419 --> 00:39:46,527
...to be very careful not to....

609
00:39:46,724 --> 00:39:50,371
--careful not to sentence anyone
who has not been proven guilty.

610
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,922
I am not a racist...

611
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:56,289
...and I do not subscribe to any
of the tenets of racism.

612
00:39:56,485 --> 00:39:58,307
In all honesty and sincerity...

613
00:39:58,501 --> 00:40:02,428
...it can be stated that I wish
nothing but freedom, justice...

614
00:40:02,628 --> 00:40:04,222
...and equality...

615
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:09,376
...life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness for all people.

616
00:40:09,764 --> 00:40:12,862
My first concern is with the group
to which I belong...

617
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:17,019
...for we, more than others, are
deprived of our inalienable rights.

618
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,130
But the true practice of Islam...

619
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:21,240
...can remove the cancer of racism...

620
00:40:21,443 --> 00:40:24,923
...from the hearts and the souls
of all Americans.

621
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:27,325
If I can die
having brought any light...

622
00:40:27,524 --> 00:40:32,259
...having exposed any truth that
will help destroy this disease...

623
00:40:32,962 --> 00:40:36,737
...then all the credit is due to Allah,
the Lord of all the worlds.

624
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:39,520
And only the mistakes have been mine.

625
00:40:41,061 --> 00:40:43,296
Please give all my love
to the children.

626
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:45,275
I love you dearly.

627
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:49,277
Sincerely,
El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz...

628
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:51,194
...Malcolm X.

629
00:41:36,992 --> 00:41:38,071
Let's begin.

630
00:41:38,272 --> 00:41:42,460
You said on your trip you sensed
a feeling of great brotherhood.

631
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:46,715
Yes, when I was in Mecca
making the pilgrimage...

632
00:41:47,582 --> 00:41:51,640
...the brotherhood that existed there
among all people, all races...

633
00:41:51,837 --> 00:41:55,697
...all levels ofpeople who
had accepted the religion of Islam...

634
00:41:56,638 --> 00:42:01,044
...what it had done
for those people, despite...

635
00:42:01,246 --> 00:42:03,132
...their complexion differences....

636
00:42:03,327 --> 00:42:06,425
Perhaps ifpeople
here in America would try...

637
00:42:06,622 --> 00:42:10,068
...and practice and study the religion
of lslam, it might help...

638
00:42:10,271 --> 00:42:13,945
...to erase the plague of racism here.

639
00:42:14,396 --> 00:42:17,497
l think Muslims over there
look at themselves as...

640
00:42:17,694 --> 00:42:22,428
...human beings, as part of
the same human family.

641
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:25,179
Today my friends are black...

642
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:27,770
...red, yellow, brown and white.

643
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:32,665
Are you prepared to ask the UN
to bring charges against the U. S...

644
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,418
...for its treatment of Negroes?

645
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:36,440
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

646
00:42:38,298 --> 00:42:40,686
The audience will have to be quiet.

647
00:42:41,466 --> 00:42:43,093
Please, please.

648
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:46,549
Yes, as I stated earlier...

649
00:42:47,515 --> 00:42:50,480
...those nations,
African, Latin, Asian nations...

650
00:42:50,684 --> 00:42:53,553
...are hypocritical
when they stand up in the UN...

651
00:42:53,753 --> 00:42:57,014
...and denounce the racism practiced
in South Africa, but...

652
00:42:57,211 --> 00:42:59,729
...say absolutely nothing about...

653
00:42:59,993 --> 00:43:02,993
...the practice of racism here
in American society.

654
00:43:03,194 --> 00:43:05,748
Now, l wouldn't be a man
if l didn't do so.

655
00:43:05,945 --> 00:43:10,681
Will you work now with leaders
of other civil rights organizations?

656
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:14,766
Yes, we're prepared to work with
any groups, leaders, organizations...

657
00:43:14,971 --> 00:43:18,385
...as long as they're
genuinely interested in results.

658
00:43:18,584 --> 00:43:19,481
Positive results.

659
00:43:19,671 --> 00:43:22,290
Does your new beard have any
religious significance?

660
00:43:23,513 --> 00:43:25,520
No, not particularly, but...

661
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:29,198
...l think that as black people
in America strive...

662
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:32,815
...to throw off the shackles
of mental colonialism...

663
00:43:33,016 --> 00:43:34,960
...they'll also reflect
their desire...

664
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,029
...to throw off the shackles of
cultural colonialism.

665
00:43:38,232 --> 00:43:41,875
l believe that a mental and cultural
migration back to Africa...

666
00:43:42,071 --> 00:43:44,012
...not necessarily a physical one...

667
00:43:44,217 --> 00:43:47,662
...but a mental and cultural
migration back to Africa...

668
00:43:47,864 --> 00:43:51,824
...which means we reaffirm our bond
with our brothers over there...

669
00:43:52,121 --> 00:43:56,111
...would help to strengthen
black people in America.

670
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:59,475
Not only spiritually,
but it would give us the incentive...

671
00:43:59,672 --> 00:44:02,739
...to solve some of our problems
here at home.

672
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:05,422
One of your
more controversial remarks...

673
00:44:05,624 --> 00:44:08,621
...called for black people to get
rifles and form clubs.

674
00:44:08,823 --> 00:44:10,447
Do you still favor that idea?

675
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:12,556
Why is that controversial?

676
00:44:12,756 --> 00:44:15,539
lf white people find themselves
the victims of...

677
00:44:15,735 --> 00:44:20,076
...the violence black people found
themselves victims of in America...

678
00:44:20,277 --> 00:44:23,854
...and if the government was unable
or unwilling to do anything...

679
00:44:24,051 --> 00:44:27,054
...it'd be intelligence on their part
to defend themselves.

680
00:44:27,253 --> 00:44:28,717
What about the guns?

681
00:44:30,516 --> 00:44:34,162
When you tell your people to stop
being violent against my people...

682
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:36,330
...l'll tell them
to put away their guns.

683
00:44:36,533 --> 00:44:37,995
So you're still an extremist.

684
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:40,079
Get your hand out of my pocket!

685
00:44:46,804 --> 00:44:47,600
Next question.

686
00:45:07,024 --> 00:45:10,570
Malcolm, you one dead, red nigger.

687
00:45:11,124 --> 00:45:14,896
Your days on this earth are
numbered, brother.

688
00:45:26,771 --> 00:45:27,849
Come to bed.

689
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,125
Get some rest.

690
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:36,839
l'm sorry, Betty.

691
00:45:38,354 --> 00:45:39,367
Sorry for what?

692
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,081
l haven't been the best husband
or the best father.

693
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,769
A family shouldn't be separated
like ours has been.

694
00:45:45,968 --> 00:45:49,482
l promise l'll never make a long trip
without you and the children.

695
00:45:53,007 --> 00:45:54,502
l miss you and the girls.

696
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:02,279
We will be together,
l promise you that.

697
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:04,583
Dear heart....

698
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:08,261
l love you.

699
00:46:12,783 --> 00:46:14,308
Thank you.

700
00:46:21,518 --> 00:46:23,242
Now get some sleep.

701
00:46:27,949 --> 00:46:31,083
We had the best organization
the black man has ever seen.

702
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:33,675
Niggers ruined it.

703
00:47:03,628 --> 00:47:04,872
Wake up!

704
00:47:08,843 --> 00:47:10,187
Come on! Let's get up!

705
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,649
Girls, come on! Come on!
Out! Out!

706
00:47:13,003 --> 00:47:14,433
Outside! Out!

707
00:47:16,491 --> 00:47:18,791
Go, go! Run, run!

708
00:47:18,989 --> 00:47:21,128
Go across the street!

709
00:47:21,324 --> 00:47:24,137
-Somebody call the fire department!
-Help! Help!

710
00:47:25,454 --> 00:47:27,395
Call the fire department, please!

711
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,538
Somebody call the fire department!

712
00:47:29,741 --> 00:47:30,949
l'm a man!

713
00:47:31,145 --> 00:47:32,324
Evidently...

714
00:47:33,706 --> 00:47:37,449
...some type of bomb was thrown against
the back of the house.

715
00:47:37,642 --> 00:47:40,542
One was thrown on the side
of the house, from what l see.

716
00:47:43,563 --> 00:47:46,408
lt bounced up against the window
and woke my daughter.

717
00:47:46,603 --> 00:47:49,451
Had it gone inside,
my 2-year-old, my 4-year-old...

718
00:47:49,641 --> 00:47:51,300
...and my 6-year-old daughter....

719
00:47:51,946 --> 00:47:54,247
Had that happened,
l'd have taken my rifle...

720
00:47:54,441 --> 00:47:56,003
...and gone after anyone in sight.

721
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,883
Was this a warning
or an attempt on your life?

722
00:47:59,081 --> 00:48:01,382
What, does it look like
a warning to you?

723
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,237
This was a definite attempt...

724
00:48:03,561 --> 00:48:07,041
...by the Nation of lslam, upon
the strict orders of Elijah Muhammad.

725
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,210
-Muslim headquarters say--
-l don't care what they say.

726
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:11,718
l see what they're doing.

727
00:48:11,913 --> 00:48:15,424
Minister Baines, can you tell us
who bombed the house?

728
00:48:15,689 --> 00:48:19,396
We feel it's a publicity stunt
on the part of Malcolm X.

729
00:48:19,624 --> 00:48:21,151
We hope it's not so that...

730
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:24,320
...if he can't keep the house,
we won't get it either.

731
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,947
That's enough. Excuse me.

732
00:48:32,263 --> 00:48:33,439
l'm all right. l'm all right.

733
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:35,363
-Betty and the kids?
-They're fine.

734
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,664
Let's post some
men in front of the house.

735
00:48:37,864 --> 00:48:40,644
-Did you see anybody?
-No, but l know who it is.

736
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:43,106
-You know l know who did it.
-Give us the command.

737
00:48:43,302 --> 00:48:46,915
Don't worry about the command.
Two men on post, two in front!

738
00:49:19,906 --> 00:49:20,955
Spark it.

739
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,571
As-Salaam-Alaikum, my brothers.

740
00:49:35,236 --> 00:49:37,853
-Here's your key. Enjoy your stay.
-Thank you.

741
00:49:41,475 --> 00:49:43,068
O. A. A. U.

742
00:49:44,387 --> 00:49:46,363
Brother Earl, it's Malcolm.

743
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:52,956
Where are you? We've been calling
all over the city.

744
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,497
Hold the phone.

745
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:04,509
I'm downtown.

746
00:50:04,832 --> 00:50:07,998
I'm in a hotel trying
to get some work done for tomorrow.

747
00:50:08,194 --> 00:50:10,911
-Let me bring some brothers there.
-That's all right.

748
00:50:11,202 --> 00:50:13,208
I wish you'd listen to us.

749
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,477
We must frisk people
at the Audubon Ballroom meeting.

750
00:50:16,674 --> 00:50:19,097
No, no! l don't want....

751
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:21,302
l don't want anybody frisked.

752
00:50:23,394 --> 00:50:25,334
We have to change our way of thinking.

753
00:50:25,537 --> 00:50:27,574
We have to make people
feel comfortable.

754
00:50:27,777 --> 00:50:31,190
If I can't be safe around my own kind,
who can I be safe around?

755
00:50:31,392 --> 00:50:33,149
I trust Allah will protect me.

756
00:50:33,346 --> 00:50:37,405
Believing in Allah is one thing,
but l also believe in being armed.

757
00:50:40,514 --> 00:50:44,024
We don't want black people
killing each other, all right?

758
00:50:46,369 --> 00:50:47,351
All right?

759
00:50:47,551 --> 00:50:49,211
We'll protect you, Malcolm.

760
00:50:49,949 --> 00:50:51,130
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

761
00:50:51,327 --> 00:50:53,846
No, peace be unto you, Earl.

762
00:51:30,013 --> 00:51:32,250
Do you have a Malcolm X registered?

763
00:52:27,483 --> 00:52:30,776
Your red nigger is dead
and so are your bastard children!

764
00:52:55,033 --> 00:52:56,492
Wake up, brother.

765
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:58,836
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

766
00:53:06,744 --> 00:53:10,095
You hear me and hear me well.
You come anywhere near my family...

767
00:53:10,328 --> 00:53:12,184
-...and l will kill you.
-Betty?

768
00:53:12,374 --> 00:53:13,617
Do you hear?

769
00:53:14,745 --> 00:53:16,205
Betty, it's me, Malcolm.

770
00:53:22,677 --> 00:53:24,303
They keep calling.

771
00:53:24,502 --> 00:53:27,668
They keep threatening. l go crazy
every time a phone rings.

772
00:53:27,863 --> 00:53:30,930
Just don't answer the phone.
Everything'll be all right.

773
00:53:31,126 --> 00:53:33,517
-When will it stop?
-Don't answer the phone.

774
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:36,651
Are the brothers there on post?

775
00:53:37,622 --> 00:53:38,865
They're outside.

776
00:53:39,062 --> 00:53:41,744
Let them answer the phone.
Don't touch the phone.

777
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,087
Beloved, where are you?

778
00:53:43,284 --> 00:53:44,913
l'm in a hotel.

779
00:53:46,263 --> 00:53:47,058
ln a hotel.

780
00:53:47,447 --> 00:53:48,819
The girls asleep?

781
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:53,132
l just put them down to bed.

782
00:53:54,006 --> 00:53:56,076
Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?

783
00:53:58,294 --> 00:53:59,854
No, l don't think so.

784
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:03,537
The girls and I want to see you.
We miss you.

785
00:54:04,406 --> 00:54:06,314
Betty, it's too dangerous.

786
00:54:07,061 --> 00:54:09,101
It's been dangerous.

787
00:54:12,149 --> 00:54:15,082
Listen, l haven't told
this to anybody...

788
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,407
...but l've been thinking...

789
00:54:19,603 --> 00:54:22,799
...about what's been happening to me
lately, to us lately...

790
00:54:23,603 --> 00:54:26,866
...and l'm gonna stop saying
The Nation of lslam's behind this.

791
00:54:27,057 --> 00:54:30,320
l know what they can and can't do.
l trained them.

792
00:54:32,082 --> 00:54:35,052
Some of the things that have
been happening lately....

793
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:40,140
l'm gonna stop staying it's just
The Nation of lslam.

794
00:54:40,337 --> 00:54:42,314
They're not working alone.

795
00:54:42,898 --> 00:54:44,685
They're getting a lot of help.

796
00:54:44,883 --> 00:54:46,572
Are you sure?

797
00:54:47,443 --> 00:54:48,815
I miss you, Betty.

798
00:54:52,306 --> 00:54:54,609
You're with us
even when you're away.

799
00:54:54,802 --> 00:54:57,998
Now listen, you come on down to
the Audubon tomorrow.

800
00:54:59,058 --> 00:55:02,538
We'll be all right.
We're not gonna let this get us down.

801
00:55:02,736 --> 00:55:04,775
You come on down.
Bring the girls too.

802
00:55:04,977 --> 00:55:07,366
The girls and I miss you so much.

803
00:55:07,698 --> 00:55:08,778
I'll see you tomorrow.

804
00:55:08,977 --> 00:55:10,983
Compared to lKing, this guy's a monk.

805
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:13,128
Good night.
Sleep well. I love you.

806
00:55:13,327 --> 00:55:14,123
Good night.

807
00:55:26,607 --> 00:55:29,159
Sweetheart, Attallah, sit back.

808
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,428
Sit up.
Sit up straight.

809
00:55:56,719 --> 00:55:59,205
Mama, l want the doll!

810
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:44,779
Sister?

811
00:56:48,395 --> 00:56:51,210
-What do you say to the nice man?
-Thank you.

812
00:56:51,401 --> 00:56:53,443
You're very welcome,
my beautiful sister.

813
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:55,553
Bye-bye.

814
00:57:11,275 --> 00:57:13,477
The minister hasn't arrived yet.

815
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:16,190
Don't worry.
He'll be here like clockwork.

816
00:57:47,944 --> 00:57:48,990
Son?

817
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:50,239
Son?

818
00:57:51,369 --> 00:57:52,775
Are you all right?

819
00:57:52,998 --> 00:57:53,983
Are you okay?

820
00:57:57,222 --> 00:57:59,492
Good.
l recognize you.

821
00:57:59,686 --> 00:58:02,109
Don't you pay them folks
no never mind.

822
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,831
You just keep right on doing
what you doing.

823
00:58:06,823 --> 00:58:07,903
Yes, ma'am.

824
00:58:08,549 --> 00:58:10,722
-l'll pray for you, son.
-Well, thank you.

825
00:58:11,108 --> 00:58:12,899
Jesus will protect you.

826
00:58:26,758 --> 00:58:28,447
ls the charter ready?

827
00:58:28,645 --> 00:58:30,366
No, Brother Minister.

828
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,283
No? Why not?

829
00:58:35,587 --> 00:58:37,412
You had enough time, didn't you?

830
00:58:37,605 --> 00:58:39,809
l apologize.
We'll have it next week.

831
00:58:40,006 --> 00:58:42,207
We don't have next week.
We need it today.

832
00:58:42,404 --> 00:58:44,673
The people want to hear
the charter today.

833
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:46,463
Next week, Minister.

834
00:58:52,678 --> 00:58:53,987
ls the reverend here?

835
00:58:54,307 --> 00:58:57,473
The reverend called and said
he wouldn't be able to attend.

836
00:58:58,885 --> 00:59:02,233
So now we don't have
an opening speaker or a charter....

837
00:59:03,013 --> 00:59:05,727
Why didn't you say this last night
when l talked to you?

838
00:59:05,925 --> 00:59:08,675
-l called Sister Betty.
-You didn't have to call her!

839
00:59:08,868 --> 00:59:10,754
You should've told me!
Why tell her?

840
00:59:10,948 --> 00:59:13,118
-l assumed that--
-Don't assume anything!

841
00:59:23,236 --> 00:59:24,347
Go on down front.

842
00:59:24,642 --> 00:59:27,099
-Sister, you go on with the brother.
-Yes, sir.

843
00:59:44,994 --> 00:59:46,140
What's wrong?

844
00:59:50,467 --> 00:59:52,700
lt's a time for martyrs now.

845
00:59:56,255 --> 00:59:58,044
The way l feel...

846
00:59:59,422 --> 01:00:01,399
...l shouldn't go out there today.

847
01:00:02,944 --> 01:00:05,333
Fine. Let's cancel it.

848
01:00:08,223 --> 01:00:10,296
My wife out there?
My children?

849
01:00:10,689 --> 01:00:12,599
Down front, as always.

850
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:18,041
Go out to the pay phone outside.

851
01:00:19,486 --> 01:00:23,610
Call up the reverend,
see if he can make it down here.

852
01:00:23,807 --> 01:00:25,529
l gotta be on post.

853
01:00:25,726 --> 01:00:27,799
l'm supposed to be
guarding you.

854
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:32,733
-Besides, that's a duty for secretaries--
-Go out to the pay phone.

855
01:00:33,246 --> 01:00:34,775
Call up the reverend.

856
01:00:35,263 --> 01:00:37,020
See if he can make it down here.

857
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:42,456
Fine.

858
01:01:35,545 --> 01:01:36,759
Thank you.

859
01:01:41,372 --> 01:01:44,087
l apologize for
raising my voice earlier.

860
01:01:44,281 --> 01:01:45,809
lt was very disrespectful.

861
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:48,428
Brother Minister, l understand.

862
01:01:57,016 --> 01:01:58,260
Why styles are changing...

863
01:01:58,584 --> 01:02:01,271
...minds are changing,
why everything is changing.

864
01:02:01,915 --> 01:02:05,808
So you and l must consider that
we're living in very changing times.

865
01:02:06,202 --> 01:02:09,516
And what might be true today
may not be true tomorrow.

866
01:02:10,391 --> 01:02:12,943
And without any further ado,
l present to you...

867
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,986
...Brother Minister Malcolm.
And l pray...

868
01:02:16,439 --> 01:02:19,987
...that you and l will listen.
Listen...

869
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,987
...hear and understand.

870
01:02:23,192 --> 01:02:23,989
Thank you.

871
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:32,020
Daddy!

872
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,791
Get your hand out of my pocket!

873
01:02:49,496 --> 01:02:50,541
Brother....

874
01:02:50,744 --> 01:02:51,790
Please. Hold it.

875
01:02:53,399 --> 01:02:55,308
Calm down.
Please, brothers!

876
01:02:55,509 --> 01:02:56,404
Brothers....

877
01:03:36,434 --> 01:03:38,441
Get an ambulance!

878
01:03:38,644 --> 01:03:39,627
Get an ambulance!

879
01:03:39,893 --> 01:03:40,973
They killed him!

880
01:03:42,678 --> 01:03:44,585
They killed him!

881
01:05:00,366 --> 01:05:01,742
Get out of the way!

882
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,595
Move!

883
01:05:15,631 --> 01:05:16,940
Stand back!

884
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:18,404
Get back!

885
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:22,634
Give us a statement, sir!
Please!

886
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:26,125
The person you know
as Malcolm X is no more.

887
01:05:26,445 --> 01:05:28,355
The assassination...

888
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:32,038
...of Malcolm X
was an unfortunate tragedy.

889
01:05:32,431 --> 01:05:34,982
And it reveals
that there are still...

890
01:05:35,308 --> 01:05:38,276
...numerous people
in our nation who have...

891
01:05:38,509 --> 01:05:42,982
...degenerated to the point of
expressing dissent through murder...

892
01:05:43,244 --> 01:05:45,448
...and we haven't learned
to disagree...

893
01:05:45,644 --> 01:05:47,621
...without being
violently disagreeable.

894
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:49,859
Here...

895
01:05:50,605 --> 01:05:53,159
...at this final hour...

896
01:05:53,707 --> 01:05:55,879
...in this quiet place...

897
01:05:56,557 --> 01:05:58,760
...Harlem has come to bid farewell...

898
01:05:58,957 --> 01:06:01,257
...to one of its brightest hopes...

899
01:06:02,252 --> 01:06:04,137
...extinguished now...

900
01:06:04,589 --> 01:06:07,141
...and gone from us forever.

901
01:06:08,013 --> 01:06:10,913
It is not in the memory
of man that this...

902
01:06:11,116 --> 01:06:12,611
...beleaguered, unfortunate...

903
01:06:12,809 --> 01:06:14,850
...but nonetheless proud community...

904
01:06:15,241 --> 01:06:19,464
...has found a braver,
more gallant young champion...

905
01:06:19,721 --> 01:06:23,040
...than this Afro-American
who lies before us...

906
01:06:23,947 --> 01:06:25,858
...unconquered still.

907
01:06:27,691 --> 01:06:29,960
I say the word again as
he would want me to:

908
01:06:30,155 --> 01:06:31,464
Afro-American.

909
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:34,853
Afro-American Malcolm.

910
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:37,669
Malcolm had stopped being "Negro"...

911
01:06:37,865 --> 01:06:39,143
...years ago.

912
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:44,103
It had become too small, too puny,
too weak a word for him.

913
01:06:44,424 --> 01:06:46,528
Malcolm was bigger than that.

914
01:06:46,826 --> 01:06:48,069
Malcolm had become...

915
01:06:48,298 --> 01:06:50,435
...an Afro-American.

916
01:06:50,697 --> 01:06:52,836
And he wanted so desperately...

917
01:06:53,352 --> 01:06:55,842
...that we,
that all his people...

918
01:06:56,041 --> 01:06:59,006
...would become Afro-Americans too.

919
01:07:02,857 --> 01:07:06,171
There are those who
still consider it their duty...

920
01:07:06,378 --> 01:07:09,920
...as friends of the Negro people,
to tell us...

921
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,096
...to revile him.

922
01:07:12,296 --> 01:07:15,461
To flee, even from
the presence of his memory.

923
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:17,116
To save ourselves...

924
01:07:17,321 --> 01:07:21,696
...by writing him out of
the history of our turbulent times.

925
01:07:22,054 --> 01:07:24,030
And we will smile.

926
01:07:24,327 --> 01:07:26,566
They will say that
he is of hate, a fanatic...

927
01:07:26,758 --> 01:07:29,628
...a racist, who can only bring
evil to the cause...

928
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:31,207
...for which you struggle.

929
01:07:31,398 --> 01:07:34,246
And we will answer and
say unto them:

930
01:07:34,436 --> 01:07:36,326
"Did you ever talk...

931
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:38,271
...to Brother Malcolm?

932
01:07:38,887 --> 01:07:40,642
Did you ever touch him...

933
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:42,877
...or have him smile at you?

934
01:07:43,077 --> 01:07:45,315
Did you ever really listen to him?"

935
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:51,518
"Was he ever associated with violence
or any public disturbance?

936
01:07:51,716 --> 01:07:54,498
For if you did, you would know him.

937
01:07:54,693 --> 01:07:56,124
And if you knew him...

938
01:07:56,356 --> 01:07:59,935
...you would know why
we must honor him. "

939
01:08:00,133 --> 01:08:04,290
Malcolm was our manhood.
Our living, black manhood.

940
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:06,492
This was his meaning
to his people.

941
01:08:06,758 --> 01:08:11,165
And in honoring him, we honor
the best in ourselves.

942
01:08:12,485 --> 01:08:15,038
However much we may have
differed with him...

943
01:08:15,234 --> 01:08:18,172
...or with each other about him
and his value as a man...

944
01:08:18,371 --> 01:08:20,412
...let his going from us serve...

945
01:08:20,611 --> 01:08:23,547
...only to bring us together now...

946
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:27,068
...consigning these mortal
remains to earth...

947
01:08:27,555 --> 01:08:29,530
...the common mother of all...

948
01:08:29,729 --> 01:08:32,926
...secure in the knowledge
that what we place in the ground...

949
01:08:33,121 --> 01:08:34,399
...is no more now a man...

950
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:36,120
...but a seed...

951
01:08:36,451 --> 01:08:39,298
...which after the winter of
our discontent...

952
01:08:39,493 --> 01:08:42,241
...will come forth again
to meet us.

953
01:08:42,436 --> 01:08:44,572
And we shall know him then...

954
01:08:44,768 --> 01:08:47,520
...for what he was and is:

955
01:08:47,713 --> 01:08:49,437
A prince.

956
01:08:49,633 --> 01:08:53,080
Our own black shining prince...

957
01:08:53,794 --> 01:08:56,829
...who didn't hesitate to die...

958
01:08:57,154 --> 01:08:58,432
...because...

959
01:08:59,074 --> 01:09:00,632
...he loved us so.

960
01:09:01,344 --> 01:09:02,491
And so today...

961
01:09:02,689 --> 01:09:05,724
...May 19, we celebrate
Malcolm X's birthday...

962
01:09:05,953 --> 01:09:09,630
...because he was
a great, great Afro-American.

963
01:09:09,888 --> 01:09:12,439
Malcolm X is you, all of you.

964
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:14,805
And you are Malcolm X.

965
01:09:15,327 --> 01:09:16,310
l'm Malcolm X!

966
01:09:16,512 --> 01:09:17,526
l'm Malcolm X!

967
01:09:17,792 --> 01:09:18,655
l'm Malcolm X!

968
01:09:27,712 --> 01:09:30,101
As Brother Malcolm said:

969
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:34,686
"We declare...

970
01:09:35,967 --> 01:09:37,562
...our right...

971
01:09:39,615 --> 01:09:41,241
...on this earth...

972
01:09:42,561 --> 01:09:44,088
...to be a man...

973
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:48,312
...to be a human being...

974
01:09:50,495 --> 01:09:52,795
...to be given the rights...

975
01:09:53,533 --> 01:09:55,192
...of a human being...

976
01:09:56,958 --> 01:09:58,714
...to be respected...

977
01:09:59,838 --> 01:10:02,008
...as a human being...

978
01:10:02,877 --> 01:10:05,047
...in this society...

979
01:10:06,236 --> 01:10:07,993
...on this earth...

980
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:11,195
...in this day...

981
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:14,294
...which we intend to bring...

982
01:10:14,493 --> 01:10:15,769
...into existence--"

983
01:10:15,964 --> 01:10:18,680
--by any means necessary!
