1
00:00:03,014 --> 00:00:04,736
In the name of Allah, the merciful.

2
00:00:04,934 --> 00:00:07,389
All praises due to Allah,
Lord of all worlds.

3
00:00:07,653 --> 00:00:09,475
The one God to whom praise
is due forever.

4
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:12,319
The one who came to us in the person
of Fard Muhammad...

5
00:00:12,517 --> 00:00:15,899
...and raised up the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad. Amen.

6
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:20,125
How do you feel?

7
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:22,656
-Who do we want to hear?
-Malcolm X!

8
00:00:22,852 --> 00:00:24,859
Are we gonna bring him on?

9
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:26,783
Yes, we gonna bring him on.

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,598
Let us hear from our minister,
Mr. Malcolm X!

11
00:00:29,794 --> 00:00:32,894
Let us bring him on with
a round of applause.

12
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:42,911
I'm here to tell you that
I charge the white man.

13
00:00:43,107 --> 00:00:46,685
I charge the white man with being
the greatest murderer on earth.

14
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:50,939
I charge the white man with being
the greatest kidnapper on earth.

15
00:00:51,169 --> 00:00:54,301
There's no place in this world that
that man can go...

16
00:00:54,626 --> 00:00:57,823
...and say he created peace
and harmony. Everywhere he's gone...

17
00:00:58,146 --> 00:00:59,423
...he's created havoc.

18
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:02,521
Everywhere he's gone,
he's created destruction.

19
00:01:02,787 --> 00:01:06,780
So I charge him with being
the greatest kidnapper on this earth!

20
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,978
I charge him with being the greatest
murderer on this earth!

21
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,302
I charge him with being the greatest
robber and enslaver on this earth!

22
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,155
I charge the white man...

23
00:01:16,354 --> 00:01:20,609
...with being the greatest swine-eater
and drunkard on this earth!

24
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:22,873
He can't deny the charges.

25
00:01:23,072 --> 00:01:27,001
You can't deny the charges!
We're the living proof of those charges!

26
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:29,207
You and I are the proof.

27
00:01:30,114 --> 00:01:33,179
You're not an American.
You are the victim ofAmerica!

28
00:01:33,408 --> 00:01:36,125
You didn't have a choice coming here.
He didn't say:

29
00:01:36,385 --> 00:01:39,964
"Black man, black woman, come over
and help me build America. "

30
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:42,364
He said, "Nigger, get in the boat.

31
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:45,821
I'm taking you over there to help me
build America. "

32
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:49,562
Being born here
does not make you an American.

33
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:54,429
You and I are not American. You're one
of the 22 million black people...

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,869
...who are victims of America.
You and I, we've never seen democracy.

35
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:04,600
There's no democracy in the fields
of Georgia. No democracy down there.

36
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:10,142
We didn't see any democracy in Harlem,
Brooklyn, Detroit, Chicago.

37
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,529
Ain't no democracy there.
We've never seen democracy.

38
00:02:14,943 --> 00:02:16,918
All we've seen is hypocrisy.

39
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:20,440
We don't see any American dream.

40
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,117
We've experienced only
the American nightmare.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,074
Подржите нас и постаните VIP члан да бисте уклонили све огласе са www.OpenSubtitles.org

42
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:25,978
See that spot?
Get it. The spot!

43
00:03:26,364 --> 00:03:28,273
All right, that's it.

44
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:08,657
Hey, Cholly!

45
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:12,470
Where'd you get that number you hit on?
Was it your girl's address?

46
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:16,658
No, my grandma gave me that number
in my dreams. Straight!

47
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:18,329
3-8-4.

48
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:20,343
You said Sassy Frassy gave you--

49
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:21,683
That woman quit me.

50
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:25,711
After l hit the number, that woman
was no good to me at all.

51
00:04:26,361 --> 00:04:30,070
She said l was cheap because
l wouldn't cop her a diamond ring.

52
00:04:30,456 --> 00:04:34,319
And on top of that,
had the indignation...

53
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:37,369
...to call me, of all people,
Good-time Cholly...

54
00:04:38,296 --> 00:04:40,271
...a cheap, black son of a bitch.

55
00:04:41,402 --> 00:04:42,262
Where's homeboy?

56
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,269
Hey, Little.

57
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:46,771
Your man out here waiting on you.

58
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,830
There he is.

59
00:04:51,576 --> 00:04:54,129
Fixing to get that first conk laid on?

60
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:56,310
Be hot like hell.

61
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,552
Don't be scared, son.

62
00:04:57,752 --> 00:05:00,336
You ain't got nothing to worry about.

63
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:03,023
You in the hands of an expert.

64
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:06,933
My hair was just like yours.
Look what he did for me.

65
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:09,458
Heckle and Jeckle...

66
00:05:09,655 --> 00:05:12,338
...don't scare the man no more than
he's scared already.

67
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:15,510
-Get his forehead and eyebrows.
-Who's doing this?

68
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:16,947
You all heard that!

69
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:22,091
Pull my coat if it stings. This shit
can burn a hole through cement.

70
00:05:22,294 --> 00:05:23,243
Hold tight.

71
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,192
l thought you said
this would sting, Shorty.

72
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:28,141
This ain't nothing.

73
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:30,098
-Feel good, don't it?
-Real good?

74
00:05:30,294 --> 00:05:31,700
Yeah, it's all right.

75
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:33,072
You'll feel better.

76
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:35,343
lt is heating up a bit.

77
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:37,452
lt's starting to heat up.

78
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:38,547
lt's okay.

79
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:40,149
Feeling better, ain't it?

80
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:42,829
-Just hold on.
-l'm holding, but it's heating.

81
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,917
Gotta make it straight.

82
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:47,244
That's what he told me too.

83
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:50,829
l gotta get this out now.
lt's starting--

84
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:55,115
-Hold on.
-l'm holding, l'm holding.

85
00:05:57,621 --> 00:05:58,483
Give me a hand!

86
00:05:58,676 --> 00:05:59,887
Help me out! Hold him!

87
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,446
We're going to the sink!

88
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:04,336
l got to get up! l got to get up!

89
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:05,939
-Cool it!
-Put water on it!

90
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,061
More water!

91
00:06:07,253 --> 00:06:09,227
You're getting it in my eye!

92
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,494
-How's it feel?
-Like there's no skin on my head!

93
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:13,870
lf you can talk, it's out.

94
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:16,402
-How does it look?
-Can't tell yet.

95
00:06:16,596 --> 00:06:19,148
ls it straight?
l'm not doing it again.

96
00:06:19,572 --> 00:06:21,328
Let me dry it.

97
00:06:23,475 --> 00:06:25,548
l can tell it's laying down.

98
00:06:28,436 --> 00:06:30,344
Don't take it off yet.

99
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:47,214
Looks white, don't it?

100
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:48,427
All right!

101
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,733
Well, all root!

102
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,912
All reet!

103
00:07:09,873 --> 00:07:11,784
Hit the brim with the left.

104
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:32,813
When my mother was pregnant with me...

105
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:37,640
...a party of Klansmen surrounded
our house in Omaha, Nebraska.

106
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,386
They brandished guns and shouted
for my father to come out.

107
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:46,635
My pregnant mother went to the door...

108
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:49,702
...and said that my father was in
Milwaukee, preaching.

109
00:07:50,193 --> 00:07:52,461
They said that good white Christians...

110
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:56,135
...would not stand for his
troublemaking and to get out of town.

111
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:17,260
They broke every window with
their rifles before riding away.

112
00:08:19,055 --> 00:08:22,916
They rode off into the moonlight as
suddenly as they had come.

113
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:28,643
My father was not a frightened Negro,
as most were and many still are today.

114
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:31,050
He was 6 feet 4 and very strong.

115
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:33,035
He believed, as did Marcus Garvey...

116
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,531
...that freedom, independence
and self-respect...

117
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:37,351
...wouldn't be achieved
by Negroes in America.

118
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:42,286
--the object of building up for
themselves a great nation in Africa.

119
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:43,747
Therefore...

120
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:47,463
...black men should leave America and
return to their land of origin.

121
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:51,847
My father dedicated his life
to his beliefs...

122
00:08:52,046 --> 00:08:54,697
...because four of his six brothers
died violently.

123
00:08:54,893 --> 00:08:57,707
Three killed by white men,
and one lynched.

124
00:08:57,966 --> 00:09:00,104
There were nine children in our family.

125
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:04,101
My mother was a proud woman, an
educated woman, a strong woman.

126
00:09:05,164 --> 00:09:09,026
She was fair-skinned because her mother
was raped by a white man.

127
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:12,742
One reason she married my father was
because he was so black.

128
00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:17,192
She hated her complexion and wanted
her children to have some color.

129
00:09:17,869 --> 00:09:22,341
I think this had a profound effect on
me then and on most Negroes today.

130
00:09:22,956 --> 00:09:27,428
Because so many of our sisters have been
raped or violated by the white man...

131
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:31,368
...black men can't wait to get their
hands on the white man's prize:

132
00:09:31,563 --> 00:09:33,158
A white woman.

133
00:09:35,468 --> 00:09:37,954
Africa for the Africans!

134
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:41,055
Say "Roseland."

135
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:45,284
Showtime!

136
00:09:45,804 --> 00:09:47,941
Showtime!

137
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:17,378
Hi, Shorty!

138
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,937
You're too big!

139
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:21,380
l'm gonna come get you.

140
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:30,334
Come on, Shorty,
l've gotta dance!

141
00:10:40,232 --> 00:10:42,304
You in charge, boy!

142
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:46,821
You like what you see, baby?

143
00:10:49,768 --> 00:10:50,565
Get back here!

144
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,806
Go ahead, boy!

145
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:53,632
Red, save me! Save me!

146
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:54,626
Gotcha!

147
00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:08,421
Come on, Shorty. l wanna dance again!

148
00:13:07,618 --> 00:13:09,656
Laura sure can go, can't she?

149
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:11,800
-l gotta go freshen up.
-All right.

150
00:13:12,002 --> 00:13:14,238
-You come on back now.
-All right, Malcolm.

151
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:17,530
That chick is fine as May wine.

152
00:13:17,794 --> 00:13:21,021
Except she lives up on a hill
and got a grandmother too.

153
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:24,250
She a church girl.
l don't know what l'm gonna do.

154
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:46,231
Wanna dance?

155
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,604
So what do they call you?

156
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:14,643
Red.

157
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:19,165
l'm Sophia.

158
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:20,788
How you doing?

159
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,746
Very well, thank you.

160
00:14:23,453 --> 00:14:25,015
l have an idea, Red.

161
00:14:27,293 --> 00:14:30,676
Why don't you take that
little girl home and come on back?

162
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:40,244
Just walk, baby, don't run.

163
00:14:42,045 --> 00:14:43,900
lt'll be here when you get back.

164
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:00,700
Well, l better not come in.

165
00:15:00,892 --> 00:15:02,418
l'm not stupid.

166
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:04,400
lt's late, baby.

167
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:07,507
l know where you're going.
l am not a total square.

168
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,937
-l know what's happening--
-l gotta go home. lt's late.

169
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:14,809
l gotta get up early in the morning.
l gotta work tomorrow.

170
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:18,970
l'll call you tomorrow?

171
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:20,658
What for?

172
00:15:20,923 --> 00:15:25,363
l'm not white and l don't put out,
so why would you want to call me?

173
00:15:29,403 --> 00:15:32,021
Good night, Mrs. Johnson.
l'll call you tomorrow.

174
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,838
Am l the first white woman
you've been with?

175
00:16:27,865 --> 00:16:29,141
No, you ain't.

176
00:16:29,464 --> 00:16:31,537
Shit, l done had plenty.

177
00:16:33,401 --> 00:16:34,895
That isn't a whore?

178
00:16:52,248 --> 00:16:53,229
Take your time.

179
00:16:53,431 --> 00:16:56,814
Sophia's not going anywhere.

180
00:16:57,911 --> 00:16:59,285
l told you to walk...

181
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:01,141
...don't run.

182
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:06,159
l don't like women that talk too much.

183
00:17:10,486 --> 00:17:11,981
Who wants to talk?

184
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:31,887
You missed me.

185
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:33,940
Try this on for size.

186
00:17:37,877 --> 00:17:39,437
-l ducked.
-You ducked?

187
00:17:39,637 --> 00:17:41,807
You didn't! l got you
right between the toes!

188
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:45,321
l'm tired of playing the cops.
l wanna be Bogart.

189
00:17:45,526 --> 00:17:48,275
Shorty, you're too small to be Bogart.

190
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:50,061
l'm not too short to be Cagney.

191
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:55,284
One more!

192
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:02,955
You dirty, rotten, stinking copper!

193
00:18:09,077 --> 00:18:10,482
You used to be a big shot.

194
00:18:15,285 --> 00:18:17,324
There is just nothing l can do.

195
00:18:17,524 --> 00:18:20,622
-What do you mean, took his own life?
-You heard the verdict.

196
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:25,423
Verdict? A man takes a hammer and
bashes in the back of his own head?

197
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,889
Then he lays on the tracks
and kills himself?

198
00:18:28,403 --> 00:18:30,606
We only act on the verdicts,
we don't make them.

199
00:18:30,804 --> 00:18:32,625
Do you pay or don't you?

200
00:18:37,524 --> 00:18:38,864
Read the policy, ma'am.

201
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:42,088
lt clearly states....

202
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:51,144
Come here, Sophia.

203
00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:02,312
You're the man.

204
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:05,614
Sit down.

205
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:13,096
What's your story?

206
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:16,396
You one of them white chicks
can't get enough colored studs?

207
00:19:26,704 --> 00:19:28,298
lKiss my foot.

208
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:32,492
Go ahead, kiss it.

209
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,920
Now feed me.

210
00:20:02,895 --> 00:20:04,650
That's your story, girl.

211
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:06,948
So when you gonna holler rape?

212
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,106
Me?

213
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:10,758
Yes, you.
You would, if the time came.

214
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,169
Sure you would.

215
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,601
Malcolm, let me feed you.

216
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:16,546
Come on.

217
00:20:17,358 --> 00:20:19,017
While they're hot.

218
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:29,543
l wish your mother and father
could see you now.

219
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:32,196
And that ofay you're gonna marry.

220
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,372
l sure wish Laura could see us.

221
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:24,774
Please, Malcolm.

222
00:21:25,547 --> 00:21:27,620
There's nobody around.

223
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:30,693
No, this ain't right.

224
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:34,213
-Why?
-Because you--

225
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:37,281
No, it's because of
the white girl, isn't it?

226
00:21:37,483 --> 00:21:41,759
-lt's not because of that.
-Folks say you run around with her.

227
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:45,607
Save it for Mr. Right. Your
grandmother's smarter than you think.

228
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:51,486
l'm sorry she raised me that way.

229
00:21:57,514 --> 00:21:58,920
ls your mother alive?

230
00:21:59,146 --> 00:22:00,094
Yes, she's alive.

231
00:22:01,578 --> 00:22:04,425
When l was a kid, l was so poor
l thought "not for sale" ...

232
00:22:04,617 --> 00:22:06,691
...was a brand name.

233
00:22:07,337 --> 00:22:08,199
l did knock.

234
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:09,799
Did you hear me say, "Come in"?

235
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:13,986
There's no point in fighting about it.
l'm sorry.

236
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,096
-May l sit down?
-You're nice enough to ask.

237
00:22:20,392 --> 00:22:22,814
lt's the same questions, Mrs. Little.

238
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,467
-Since your husband's death...
-Murder. Murder.

239
00:22:26,824 --> 00:22:31,079
...there's a question as to whether you
can raise these children alone.

240
00:22:32,456 --> 00:22:34,399
These are my children.

241
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,634
They're mine.

242
00:22:38,664 --> 00:22:40,190
And they ain't no question.

243
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:45,127
Sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor
is the only kindness.

244
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:47,395
All your children are delinquent...

245
00:22:47,592 --> 00:22:50,591
...and one at least,
Malcolm, is a thief.

246
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:51,423
Get out!

247
00:22:51,623 --> 00:22:54,972
Your control over your
children is nonexistent.

248
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:56,583
Did you hear me?

249
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:00,416
You will regret this.

250
00:23:00,615 --> 00:23:04,706
lf you don't move through that door,
you'll be past regretting!

251
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:10,683
We were parceled out, all of us.

252
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:15,076
I truly believe that if ever
a state agency destroyed a family...

253
00:23:15,397 --> 00:23:16,707
...it destroyed ours.

254
00:23:17,254 --> 00:23:21,989
I was sent to a detention
home and lived at this woman's house.

255
00:23:22,246 --> 00:23:23,620
Mrs. Swerlin.

256
00:23:23,814 --> 00:23:26,813
Boys, this is Malcolm, our new guest.

257
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:28,832
We'll treat him like a brother.

258
00:23:29,926 --> 00:23:33,154
I was special. The only
colored kid in the class.

259
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,608
I became sort of a mascot,
like a pink poodle.

260
00:23:37,253 --> 00:23:40,700
I got called a nigger so much,
I didn't think it was wrong.

261
00:23:40,902 --> 00:23:42,756
I thought it was my name.

262
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:46,686
They talked about me like I wasn't
there. Like a pedigreed dog...

263
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:48,260
...or a horse.

264
00:23:48,998 --> 00:23:50,207
Like I was invisible.

265
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:54,142
The important thing
is to be realistic.

266
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,728
We all like you here, you know that.

267
00:23:57,316 --> 00:23:58,746
But you're a nigger...

268
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,112
...and a lawyer is no realistic
goal for a nigger.

269
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,795
But why, Mr. Ostrowski?

270
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,329
l gets the best grades in class.

271
00:24:07,524 --> 00:24:10,819
l got voted class president.
l want to be a lawyer.

272
00:24:11,011 --> 00:24:14,012
l want you to think about
something that you can be.

273
00:24:14,531 --> 00:24:17,630
You're good with your hands,
making things.

274
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,089
People would give you work. l would.

275
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,136
Why not become a carpenter?

276
00:24:23,843 --> 00:24:26,264
That's a good profession for a colored.

277
00:24:27,362 --> 00:24:28,989
Wasn't your pa a carpenter?

278
00:24:30,116 --> 00:24:31,774
Jesus was a carpenter.

279
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:35,836
People like you as a person.
You're doing real well.

280
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:39,127
Remember what we said.

281
00:24:39,555 --> 00:24:42,010
"Nothing succeeds like success."
Say it.

282
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,511
Nothing succeeds like success.

283
00:24:44,705 --> 00:24:46,528
As long as you're realistic.

284
00:24:46,722 --> 00:24:48,380
lt's not the end of the world.

285
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:52,825
l said, "Don't...

286
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:55,935
...let them give that boy no pig."

287
00:24:56,481 --> 00:24:58,204
It wasn't the end
of the world for me.

288
00:24:58,401 --> 00:25:00,638
But it was the beginning of the end
for my mother.

289
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:07,935
A right cross to thejaw by Louis.

290
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:14,237
Louis takes Conn's head back
with a right uppercut.

291
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:15,993
Louis hits left and right.

292
00:25:16,193 --> 00:25:19,541
And Conn is down
with a right cross to thejaw!

293
00:25:19,777 --> 00:25:21,272
He's taking the count.

294
00:25:21,472 --> 00:25:24,025
Four, five, six...

295
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,769
...seven. He's on his back.
Eight. Nine.

296
00:25:28,033 --> 00:25:31,742
He's getting up!
The referee says it's all over!

297
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,437
What in hell is going on?

298
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:38,587
Nothing, Mr. Cooper.

299
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:40,190
The customer's are hungry.

300
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,078
Soup done finished, Mr. Cooper.

301
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:43,931
Right, Mr. Charlie.

302
00:25:44,512 --> 00:25:45,821
The name is Mr. Cooper.

303
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:47,607
Don't you forget it.

304
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:49,977
Mr. Cooper.

305
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:55,454
What's the matter with you?
You want me to get fired!

306
00:25:55,647 --> 00:25:56,858
l got a wife and six kids!

307
00:25:57,054 --> 00:25:59,357
Mr. Cooper is good white folk!

308
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:01,884
You is a young fool!

309
00:26:10,078 --> 00:26:12,663
There'll never be another one like that!

310
00:26:14,013 --> 00:26:15,126
He's done it!

311
00:26:15,326 --> 00:26:17,561
And by a knockout...

312
00:26:17,757 --> 00:26:21,139
...and still the world's
heavyweight champion:

313
00:26:21,374 --> 00:26:23,446
Joe Louis!

314
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:25,336
Ham and cheese!
Excuse me, sir.

315
00:26:25,534 --> 00:26:28,183
Ham and cheese here! l got coffee.

316
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:30,902
-Lemon meringue pie.
-Hey, boy!

317
00:26:31,164 --> 00:26:34,362
-Ham and cheese.
-Yes, sir. Best in the house.

318
00:26:34,557 --> 00:26:37,209
-You're pleased with yourself.
-l aims to please, sir.

319
00:26:37,404 --> 00:26:38,484
l'm pleased to aim.

320
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:40,179
-l like you, boy.
-Thank you.

321
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:44,857
lKeep the change.

322
00:26:45,052 --> 00:26:47,290
Right, sir!
Ham and cheese!

323
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:55,929
Harlem!

324
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:19,542
And here's Joe Lewis,
back in Harlem.

325
00:27:20,091 --> 00:27:22,131
They're celebrating!
They're going crazy!

326
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:25,397
They're dancing! They're hanging
from street signs!

327
00:27:25,594 --> 00:27:27,254
Everybody's out!

328
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:30,512
Everyone's having a great time!
Listen to them roar!

329
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:07,350
Joe's a credit to his race.
What a fine gentleman!

330
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:09,496
But he's also a fine American.

331
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,886
The Brown Bomber, Joe Louis!

332
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,465
Hey, sugar.

333
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,282
-Slow down. What's your hurry?
-No hurry.

334
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:21,007
Let me show you something new.

335
00:28:22,104 --> 00:28:24,078
l got gold watches, diamond rings.

336
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:26,134
Any one of these. Whatever you need.

337
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:27,349
l don't need that.

338
00:28:27,543 --> 00:28:30,480
You need something, baby.
Whatever you need!

339
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:32,436
A couple of these
make a player look good.

340
00:29:02,423 --> 00:29:03,698
My man!

341
00:29:03,894 --> 00:29:07,952
-The word is "excuse me," boy.
-"Excuse me" don't shine my shoes.

342
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,775
Then stay out of my way.

343
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:13,938
Old country nigger.

344
00:29:18,198 --> 00:29:19,888
What you gonna do?

345
00:29:26,261 --> 00:29:27,374
Go home to your mama?

346
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:41,648
Nigger, don't you ever in your life
say anything against my mother!

347
00:30:02,547 --> 00:30:03,726
Give me a whiskey.

348
00:30:12,628 --> 00:30:14,221
l ordered a single, Jack.

349
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,840
The double's on that gentleman, "Jack."

350
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,443
Who is that?

351
00:30:23,315 --> 00:30:25,323
That's West lndian Archie.

352
00:30:25,747 --> 00:30:27,340
What's his angle?

353
00:30:28,531 --> 00:30:31,018
Some of this, some of that.

354
00:30:43,473 --> 00:30:45,132
Nothing's gonna bite you.

355
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:48,776
You look like you're new in town.

356
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:51,977
From what l can see,
you're pretty handy with a bottle.

357
00:30:52,177 --> 00:30:52,974
He had it coming.

358
00:30:54,481 --> 00:30:55,691
Pull up a chair.

359
00:31:05,937 --> 00:31:07,344
What do they call you?

360
00:31:07,697 --> 00:31:08,776
Red.

361
00:31:09,585 --> 00:31:10,762
And l ain't no punk.

362
00:31:11,024 --> 00:31:12,301
You better not be.

363
00:31:13,008 --> 00:31:15,595
Any cat toe you down here,
you stand up or make tracks.

364
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:16,905
Man live by his rep.

365
00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:17,996
Better believe it.

366
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,869
So what do you do?

367
00:31:21,073 --> 00:31:22,021
Working on the train.

368
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:24,492
Like that job?

369
00:31:24,944 --> 00:31:28,424
-lKeeps me out of the Army.
-They want you, nothing'll keep you out.

370
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:29,420
Not this boy.

371
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,646
So l hear tell
you're a good man to know.

372
00:31:33,838 --> 00:31:35,781
-Where you hear that?
-Boston, where l'm from.

373
00:31:35,985 --> 00:31:37,445
lKiss my neck.

374
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:39,269
l've never been in Beantown.

375
00:31:39,471 --> 00:31:42,189
Like the man said, a man's rep travels.

376
00:31:43,183 --> 00:31:44,458
How about that!

377
00:31:46,607 --> 00:31:47,687
You bullshitting me?

378
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:50,788
My father told me
never bullshit a West lndian.

379
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,168
Your daddy's West lndian?

380
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:53,479
My mama.

381
00:31:54,126 --> 00:31:55,818
She's from Grenada.

382
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,321
Grenada.

383
00:32:01,103 --> 00:32:01,932
l like this guy.

384
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,173
l like your country.

385
00:32:04,942 --> 00:32:06,185
Grenada.

386
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,838
Where'd you get them
goddamn vines you got on?

387
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,660
And them shoes?

388
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:11,754
Oh, my.

389
00:32:11,949 --> 00:32:13,323
We can do something about that.

390
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:16,649
But he's putting a hurting
on my vision, man!

391
00:32:16,845 --> 00:32:17,959
Relax.

392
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:19,588
How do l find you?

393
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,935
You can't.

394
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,019
l get ahold of you.

395
00:32:23,214 --> 00:32:25,286
All right, l'll write it down.

396
00:32:25,484 --> 00:32:27,241
Don't ever write anything down.

397
00:32:27,437 --> 00:32:29,096
File it up here.

398
00:32:29,422 --> 00:32:30,762
Like l do.

399
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:34,826
lf the man don't have any paper,
he will never have any proof.

400
00:32:35,341 --> 00:32:36,355
Dig?

401
00:32:37,837 --> 00:32:40,324
Yeah, l dig. Right.

402
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,181
Look me in the face.

403
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,974
Did you just con me?

404
00:32:50,764 --> 00:32:51,811
Yes, sir.

405
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:53,065
Why?

406
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,722
Because l want in.

407
00:32:55,563 --> 00:32:58,116
lt don't take a lot to know
you're already there.

408
00:32:58,316 --> 00:32:59,909
At least he ain't lying.

409
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:01,482
l have a run to make.

410
00:33:01,677 --> 00:33:03,912
Let me make that run
with you, Mr. Archie.

411
00:33:12,748 --> 00:33:13,696
l like your heart.

412
00:33:14,763 --> 00:33:16,356
l like your style.

413
00:33:17,258 --> 00:33:19,200
You might just do, Mr. Red.

414
00:33:19,403 --> 00:33:22,469
Unless you have to
get back to your train job.

415
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:24,706
l've told him what to do
with that train.

416
00:33:24,907 --> 00:33:26,084
-When?
-Just now.

417
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,453
All right.

418
00:33:33,163 --> 00:33:34,275
Come with me.

419
00:33:34,602 --> 00:33:36,293
l'm taking you shopping.

420
00:33:37,963 --> 00:33:39,554
Cadillac's the name.

421
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:41,891
Sammy, man.

422
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,645
-You ready?
-Good.

423
00:33:47,914 --> 00:33:49,735
Button more buttons on the jacket.

424
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,617
You look good.

425
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,091
But you're missing something.

426
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:02,086
Frisk me.

427
00:34:02,729 --> 00:34:04,584
Go ahead, frisk me.

428
00:34:12,874 --> 00:34:13,985
Nothing, right?

429
00:34:19,944 --> 00:34:21,121
l'm still carrying.

430
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:23,073
This was my first gun.

431
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,760
Now it's yours.

432
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,829
Thank you.

433
00:34:34,023 --> 00:34:35,234
You wear it...

434
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,414
...wear it so.

435
00:34:38,696 --> 00:34:40,190
Small of the back.

436
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,554
Now you're outfitted.

437
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:46,561
Ready for the streets?

438
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,036
l'm ready.

439
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:49,667
Let them come.

440
00:34:49,862 --> 00:34:54,466
Let us now turn to
the Gospel According to St. John.

441
00:34:54,727 --> 00:34:55,937
Chapter 3...

442
00:34:56,134 --> 00:34:58,589
...verse 23.

443
00:34:59,079 --> 00:34:59,874
323.

444
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:04,772
"And John also was baptizing
in Aenon near Salim...

445
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:09,313
...because there was much water.

446
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:13,442
And they came...

447
00:35:14,054 --> 00:35:16,193
...and were baptized."

448
00:35:18,406 --> 00:35:19,867
313.

449
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:22,596
255.

450
00:35:23,045 --> 00:35:24,736
lt got to be 25 1.

451
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:26,146
403.

452
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,196
l saw it in my dream.

453
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:30,724
555.

454
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:33,305
-What do you know?
-l feel straight.

455
00:35:34,373 --> 00:35:35,618
Your lucky day.

456
00:35:35,813 --> 00:35:37,122
Roll it for me.

457
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:40,671
l told you, no paper, no trouble.

458
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:42,532
l'm working on it.

459
00:35:43,557 --> 00:35:45,857
l keep my numbers in my head.

460
00:35:46,053 --> 00:35:49,794
l've never written a number down yet.
Remember that.

461
00:36:04,098 --> 00:36:05,243
Your turn.

462
00:36:11,363 --> 00:36:12,378
Easy.

463
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:17,052
Easy.

464
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,775
You there?

465
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:21,180
lf l ain't, l'm next door.

466
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:25,185
Nothing in this world can give you
that real deep cool.

467
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:27,007
The girl.

468
00:36:43,298 --> 00:36:45,305
About as mellow as l can be.

469
00:36:50,529 --> 00:36:51,577
Cool enough to kill.

470
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,119
l realize that.

471
00:36:55,617 --> 00:36:57,853
-Easy, easy, easy, easy.
-Stick them up.

472
00:37:01,537 --> 00:37:02,464
Archie!

473
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,005
Baby?

474
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,590
Malcolm, you're so funny.

475
00:37:15,935 --> 00:37:17,397
Give me some money, baby.

476
00:37:22,689 --> 00:37:24,314
Come on, baby.

477
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:26,267
The bitch move too slow.

478
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,210
Sometimes this guy
has a big ugly mouth.

479
00:37:33,407 --> 00:37:34,815
What time is it, baby?

480
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:37,813
8:21.

481
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:39,389
l like that. Combinate me.

482
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,623
821.

483
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:43,449
128.

484
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:46,133
218.

485
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:47,413
l'm taking the bet.

486
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,561
Time to reload.

487
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:42,163
l thought you said we was going
to the movies last night.

488
00:38:42,365 --> 00:38:43,226
You said that.

489
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:45,339
l'm sorry. l say a lot of things.

490
00:38:45,563 --> 00:38:46,426
l believed you.

491
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,035
Do your job now. Get me a pack
of Lucky Strikes and a cognac.

492
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:03,763
Daniel come in yet?

493
00:39:03,964 --> 00:39:05,392
Ain't that him?

494
00:39:06,139 --> 00:39:07,087
Gorgeous!

495
00:39:07,738 --> 00:39:10,608
How you been today?
You been waiting long?

496
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,973
Let me look at you.

497
00:39:15,611 --> 00:39:18,927
-l've been missing you today, Laura.
-How you doing, baby?

498
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,643
l'm all right. Copacetic. Great.
Did you work today?

499
00:39:22,842 --> 00:39:25,298
No, baby, l didn't go to work.

500
00:39:25,499 --> 00:39:28,345
-l need a five-spot.
-l gave you 10 this morning.

501
00:39:28,795 --> 00:39:31,128
Give me the goddamn $5!

502
00:39:31,323 --> 00:39:32,783
lt ain't the money.
l wanna...

503
00:39:32,986 --> 00:39:34,512
...make sure you're okay.

504

505
00:39:37,497 --> 00:39:38,642
l'll be right back.

506
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:41,303
Like last time?

507
00:39:41,498 --> 00:39:43,385
l swear, l'll be right back.

508
00:39:43,577 --> 00:39:45,552
Laura, l love you.

509
00:39:53,688 --> 00:39:55,150
You know that chick?

510
00:39:57,146 --> 00:39:58,933
You a private detective now?

511
00:39:59,128 --> 00:40:00,056
Just asking.

512
00:40:00,249 --> 00:40:02,255
Don't ask me no goddamn questions.

513
00:40:02,456 --> 00:40:05,009
l ask you the questions.
You understand?

514
00:40:05,848 --> 00:40:08,150
-She come in here a lot?
-Almost every night.

515
00:40:08,345 --> 00:40:09,326
With him?

516
00:40:10,937 --> 00:40:13,303
-She know he's high?
-lf she got eyes, she do.

517
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:16,462
She ain't hooking?

518
00:40:16,825 --> 00:40:18,580
Not yet, Red.

519
00:40:19,095 --> 00:40:22,096
But the way things are,
he'll turn her out any day now.

520
00:40:26,935 --> 00:40:28,343
You stuck on her?

521
00:40:28,536 --> 00:40:32,048
That's your problem.
You need to mind your own business.

522
00:40:35,062 --> 00:40:36,077
Don't do that!

523
00:40:36,278 --> 00:40:38,963
l wanna talk to you, all right?
Have a seat.

524
00:40:47,734 --> 00:40:49,874
-Don't pay him any mind, hear?
-All right.

525
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,630
-All right?
-l'm all right.

526
00:40:58,037 --> 00:41:00,046
Buy yourself something nice.

527
00:41:11,382 --> 00:41:12,527
Hey, baby.

528
00:41:17,622 --> 00:41:18,996
Give me a light.

529
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,279
You look uptight.
What's the problem?

530
00:41:31,477 --> 00:41:32,426
-No problem.
-Sure?

531
00:41:32,628 --> 00:41:35,476
Everything's all right.
l'm not worrying about it.

532
00:41:37,972 --> 00:41:39,727
l'm thinking about my money.

533
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:41,936
Six big ones you owe me, right?

534
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:42,928
What?

535
00:41:43,124 --> 00:41:44,204
821.
lt hit, didn't it?

536
00:41:44,404 --> 00:41:45,898
You didn't have 821.

537
00:41:46,355 --> 00:41:49,650
Were you high? l threw the slats
at you, told you to combinate me.

538
00:41:50,035 --> 00:41:51,247
You never had it.

539
00:41:51,444 --> 00:41:53,680
l tell you l did. Sophia was there.

540
00:41:54,036 --> 00:41:55,530
You remember, don't you?

541
00:41:55,731 --> 00:41:56,680
What would she say?

542
00:41:58,131 --> 00:41:59,657
Don't do this.

543
00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:00,841
All right?

544
00:42:01,236 --> 00:42:02,513
All right.

545
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:06,028
All right, skip it.

546
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,818
But you're slipping, aren't you?

547
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,439
You done slipped.

548
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,984
Archie, wait.

549
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,849
Come on, Archie. Look....

550
00:42:28,594 --> 00:42:31,376
Come on. You want a drink
or something? l'm buying.

551
00:42:31,569 --> 00:42:32,780
l ain't drinking with you.

552
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,329
All right?

553
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:41,482
Come, Sam.

554
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:44,750
l'll be right there, man.

555
00:42:51,056 --> 00:42:53,130
Twenty-two years.

556
00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:56,808
Twenty-two years, l never
knowed him to forget a number.

557
00:42:57,009 --> 00:42:58,415
First time for everything.

558
00:42:58,608 --> 00:43:00,397
What are you talking about?

559
00:43:00,592 --> 00:43:05,000
The first thing he'll do is check
with the collector for an oversight.

560
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:08,134
His rep is on the line. So is yours.

561
00:43:09,073 --> 00:43:13,033
And, Red, if you're lying,
you're a dead man.

562
00:43:13,648 --> 00:43:16,844
Dead, dead, dead.

563
00:43:18,737 --> 00:43:20,165
You go and tell him that.

564
00:43:27,087 --> 00:43:28,746
My man, Red.

565
00:43:29,614 --> 00:43:30,662
Night to you.

566
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:35,148
l don't understand Archie.
You had the number.

567
00:44:07,469 --> 00:44:09,957
Didn't l tell you never sit
with your back to no door?

568
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:16,901
You know what?

569
00:44:18,924 --> 00:44:20,583
You're a damn liar.

570
00:44:20,844 --> 00:44:22,088
And so is she.

571
00:44:25,549 --> 00:44:27,110
So you figure to take me...

572
00:44:27,309 --> 00:44:28,835
...you bastard?

573
00:44:29,644 --> 00:44:30,854
l'm taking you.

574
00:44:31,053 --> 00:44:33,289
-So it's you and me?
-That's right.

575
00:44:33,485 --> 00:44:35,010
l'll give you the $600.

576
00:44:35,212 --> 00:44:36,870
-l don't want it.
-l'm wearing.

577
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:40,067
There's three guns on you,
so you take your chances.

578
00:44:51,179 --> 00:44:52,390
Let's walk.

579
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,184
So this is how l'm going out?

580
00:45:02,922 --> 00:45:05,377
-ln a toe-down?
-Toe-down, yes.

581
00:45:06,379 --> 00:45:09,227
-Let's go.
-We'll let Billie finish.

582
00:45:53,225 --> 00:45:54,534
Thank you.

583
00:45:54,729 --> 00:45:57,380
Thank you very much. Thank you.

584
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:20,093
Wake up.

585
00:46:21,286 --> 00:46:22,532
Wake up!

586
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:26,013
There's somebody out there.

587
00:46:29,063 --> 00:46:30,493
Wake the kids.

588
00:46:43,975 --> 00:46:46,430
Follow me! Wait! Wait!

589
00:46:49,189 --> 00:46:49,985
Go! Go!

590
00:46:53,223 --> 00:46:54,171
Careful!

591
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:01,084
-Good thing we're all good Christians.
-lt's time for you to leave this town.

592
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:02,366
lt's a free country.

593
00:47:02,565 --> 00:47:05,914
We warned you about Garvey preaching!
Stirring up the good niggras!

594
00:47:06,117 --> 00:47:07,100
l ain't a boy!

595
00:47:07,301 --> 00:47:08,861
-l'm a man!
-You're a dead nigger.

596
00:47:09,062 --> 00:47:11,680
And a real man don't hide
behind sheets!

597
00:47:11,877 --> 00:47:14,267
You take these bullets for them sheets!

598
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:22,914
l know you're a better shot than that.

599
00:47:23,205 --> 00:47:24,732
You should've killed them.

600
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,109
You should've shot them all dead.

601
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,926
l just wanted to scare them.

602
00:47:29,796 --> 00:47:32,284
They won't be around here
bothering us no more.

603
00:47:33,764 --> 00:47:35,870
They won't be here no time soon.

604
00:47:36,452 --> 00:47:37,729
l'm a man!

605
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,925
That'll teach you.

606
00:47:48,067 --> 00:47:48,863
Get a doctor!

607
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,425
He doesn't need a doctor,
he needs a preacher.

608
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:54,521
l'm glad we got you out of there.

609
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:57,632
With Archie on your ass,
your name on the wire...

610
00:47:57,828 --> 00:48:00,413
...Boston's the best
goddamn place for you.

611
00:48:01,347 --> 00:48:03,486
We'll take it easy, huh, baby?

612
00:48:03,778 --> 00:48:07,194
l got a place fixed up for us
on Harvard Square. How's that sound?

613
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:10,076
Sounds good. We'll lay low for a while.

614
00:48:10,531 --> 00:48:13,497
Don't you worry about a thing.
l'll stake you.

615
00:48:13,762 --> 00:48:16,152
l got my band. l'm blowing great sax.

616
00:48:16,675 --> 00:48:18,267
You ain't even heard us play!

617
00:48:18,466 --> 00:48:20,441
Like every hustler, I was trapped.

618
00:48:20,642 --> 00:48:22,682
Cats that hung together
to find security...

619
00:48:22,882 --> 00:48:24,921
...to find an answer, found nothing.

620
00:48:25,121 --> 00:48:27,161
Cats that might've cured cancer....

621
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:30,111
West Indian Archie might've been
a mathematical genius.

622
00:48:30,305 --> 00:48:33,175
We were all victims
of the American social order.

623
00:48:33,505 --> 00:48:36,985
Until that time, there were
three things I was always afraid of:

624
00:48:37,186 --> 00:48:40,001
a job, a bust andjail.

625
00:48:40,193 --> 00:48:44,350
But I realized then that I wasn't
afraid of anything. I was an animal.

626
00:48:45,152 --> 00:48:46,745
He don't look too good.

627
00:48:49,025 --> 00:48:50,934
We're gonna rob this town blind.

628
00:48:51,138 --> 00:48:52,795
Anybody want out, say so now.

629
00:48:54,721 --> 00:48:57,469
l set up a stake, and l got
somebody to move the goods.

630
00:48:57,665 --> 00:48:59,803
We need a driver. Any suggestions?

631
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,561
How about Rudy?

632
00:49:02,336 --> 00:49:03,448
Who's Rudy?

633
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:08,475
l'm half-wop, half-nigger.
l'm not afraid of nobody.

634
00:49:10,337 --> 00:49:11,166
What do you do?

635
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,701
Name it, l claim it.

636
00:49:12,895 --> 00:49:15,350
Rudy does catering. Rich joints.

637
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:16,347
All right.

638
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,655
Tell him about Baldy.

639
00:49:20,576 --> 00:49:22,647
He's this old, rich ofay motherfucker.

640
00:49:22,847 --> 00:49:24,789
l give him a bath every Friday night.

641
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:28,667
Towel him off,
talcum powder on him, put him to bed.

642
00:49:29,055 --> 00:49:30,910
Just like a baby.
He gets his jollies off.

643
00:49:31,103 --> 00:49:32,150
What about him?

644
00:49:32,352 --> 00:49:36,148
Guy's got jewelry. He's got
a coin collection. He's got china.

645
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,522
-He's got rugs.
-That might be all right.

646
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:42,265
Shit, l know this town.
l got my own fences.

647
00:49:43,615 --> 00:49:44,542
Who is this guy?

648
00:49:46,269 --> 00:49:47,513
Who put you in charge?

649
00:49:48,222 --> 00:49:49,302
You wanna be in charge?

650
00:49:49,502 --> 00:49:50,299
l am in charge.

651
00:49:50,495 --> 00:49:53,561
-You head nigger in charge.
-l'm the head nigger in charge.

652
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,001
Big-head nigger.

653
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:58,069
l'll tell you what.

654
00:49:59,357 --> 00:50:00,884
Because l'm a fair man...

655
00:50:01,853 --> 00:50:03,926
...and l like
big-head niggers like you.

656
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,010
We'll flip for it.

657
00:50:07,389 --> 00:50:08,337
We'll flip this.

658
00:50:15,069 --> 00:50:16,497
She loves me.

659
00:50:17,372 --> 00:50:19,064
She loves me not.

660
00:50:19,868 --> 00:50:21,526
She loves me.

661
00:50:23,134 --> 00:50:24,888
She loves me not.

662
00:50:27,228 --> 00:50:28,176
She loves me.

663
00:50:43,163 --> 00:50:44,178
l'll flip first.

664
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:47,286
Red, cool it. Come on.

665
00:50:47,483 --> 00:50:49,206
Head man in charge, right?

666
00:50:49,756 --> 00:50:51,282
Put the gun down.

667
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:53,881
We believe you.

668
00:50:54,588 --> 00:50:55,994
We believe you.

669
00:50:57,146 --> 00:50:59,864
Red, stop clowning around, all right?
For chrissakes!

670
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:01,302
Your turn, Rudy.

671
00:51:01,499 --> 00:51:03,767
Quit fooling around. Come on, guys.

672
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:10,903
You don't wanna flip?

673
00:51:11,449 --> 00:51:13,655
-Let me show you how.
-Red, don't!

674
00:51:13,851 --> 00:51:15,705
He doesn't know how.
l have to show him.

675
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:17,904
Did you miss something?

676
00:51:18,107 --> 00:51:20,823
You got your eyes open?
Look at me.

677
00:51:21,274 --> 00:51:23,216
You don't have to do this, Red.

678
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:26,325
That was really dumb.

679
00:51:29,818 --> 00:51:33,494
Your flip. You wanna do it?
No, you don't, do you?

680
00:51:33,689 --> 00:51:34,966
l'll help you.

681
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:36,949
-Here.
-Red, don't.

682
00:51:39,193 --> 00:51:41,429
Should we shoot that
wop nose of yours off?

683
00:51:41,625 --> 00:51:44,974
Or is that the nigger side?
ls that the wop side or the nigger side?

684
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,467
ls that wop or nigger?
l guess that's the wop side.

685
00:51:48,696 --> 00:51:49,973
l'm not going to jail.

686
00:51:50,169 --> 00:51:53,071
Put the gun away.
Come on, this is enough.

687
00:51:53,272 --> 00:51:55,281
Say goodbye, Rudy.

688
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:00,495
Rudy said something.

689
00:52:00,696 --> 00:52:02,006
What'd you say?

690
00:52:03,383 --> 00:52:04,812
Speak up.

691
00:52:07,576 --> 00:52:10,804
Jesus Christ!
When are you gonna stop?

692
00:52:11,832 --> 00:52:13,653
l did two, so l owe you two.

693
00:52:13,912 --> 00:52:15,056
You got it.

694
00:52:15,254 --> 00:52:17,809
-l got it. What did you say?
-You got it.

695
00:52:18,008 --> 00:52:19,600
Rudy says l got it.

696
00:52:20,983 --> 00:52:22,772
Rudy, don't you ever...

697
00:52:22,968 --> 00:52:26,164
...try and cross someone who
ain't afraid to die, you hear me?

698
00:52:27,576 --> 00:52:28,820
All right.

699
00:52:29,622 --> 00:52:30,832
This is what we'll do.

700
00:52:31,031 --> 00:52:33,332
We'll hit old Talcum Powder tonight.

701
00:52:33,527 --> 00:52:36,462
My friend Rudy's gonna
draw up the plans.

702
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,898
Everything that's in the house, right?

703
00:52:39,607 --> 00:52:42,902
Peg, Sophia, you get those tools
like l asked you.

704
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:47,218
We're gonna hit tonight because some of
us have high visibility during the day.

705
00:52:50,807 --> 00:52:52,660
lt's okay with you, right?

706
00:52:56,277 --> 00:52:57,969
Merry Christmas, Rudy.

707
00:52:58,166 --> 00:52:59,921
One big happy family.

708
00:53:03,286 --> 00:53:04,495
l love you.

709
00:53:26,676 --> 00:53:29,327
What happened to the bullet?
Did you palm that bullet?

710
00:53:29,525 --> 00:53:30,637
What bullet?

711
00:53:30,996 --> 00:53:32,240
The bullet.

712
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,015
You're crazy.

713
00:53:46,995 --> 00:53:47,943
Shorty!

714
00:54:04,467 --> 00:54:06,834
Easy, Shorty, easy.

715
00:55:11,855 --> 00:55:13,481
My man, Red.

716
00:55:14,864 --> 00:55:16,140
My man!

717
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:19,695
When's Rudy due back?

718
00:55:20,686 --> 00:55:22,147
Thirty minutes.

719
00:55:25,168 --> 00:55:26,955
l'm almost finished.

720
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:36,007
Girls ought to be getting back
from casing that rug joint.

721
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,449
They should be.

722
00:55:39,151 --> 00:55:40,874
We've done a good job.

723
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,631
We're killing them, ain't we?

724
00:55:45,614 --> 00:55:48,135
They don't know what's hitting them.

725
00:55:48,334 --> 00:55:51,367
-Let me work back in this kitchen.
-You getting the kitchen?

726
00:55:51,566 --> 00:55:53,835
Putting naps on in the kitchen.

727
00:55:54,029 --> 00:55:57,674
lf you can't take the heat,
get out of the kitchen.

728
00:55:58,734 --> 00:56:00,488
All right, let's go to the sink.

729
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:06,250
Come on, it's starting to heat up.

730
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,388
-lt's burning?
-lt's all right.

731
00:56:09,997 --> 00:56:11,524
Put your head down.

732
00:56:13,452 --> 00:56:15,842
-Come on, man.
-l turned it.

733
00:56:23,596 --> 00:56:25,767
lt's started to sting.
Get out of the way!

734
00:56:30,956 --> 00:56:31,752
lt's burning?

735
00:56:31,947 --> 00:56:33,508
Hell, yeah, it's burning!

736
00:56:37,164 --> 00:56:38,594
Goddamn it!

737
00:56:44,684 --> 00:56:47,302
Nigger, take your head
out of the shit bowl!

738
00:56:47,499 --> 00:56:49,125
That's it. Get up slowly.

739
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,362
Watch it! No funny business now.

740
00:56:52,554 --> 00:56:54,922
Red, the jig is up.

741
00:56:55,115 --> 00:56:57,701
The average first offender
gets two years for burglary.

742
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,937
We were all first offenders.
That's what the girls drew.

743
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:03,497
Two years in the women's reformatory.

744
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:05,000
Our crime wasn't burglary.

745
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:08,674
It was sleeping with white girls.
They threw the book at us.

746
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:11,776
Burglary, count one, 8 to 10 years.

747
00:57:11,979 --> 00:57:14,149
Count two, 8 to 10 years.

748
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,735
Count three, 8 to 10 years.

749
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:19,142
Count four, 8 to 10 years.

750
00:57:19,339 --> 00:57:21,378
Count five, 8 to 10 years.

751
00:57:21,578 --> 00:57:26,150
Count six, 8 to 10 years.
Count seven, 8 to 10 years.

752
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:28,515
Count eight, 8 to 10 years.

753
00:57:28,713 --> 00:57:32,991
Count nine, 8 to 10 years.
Count ten, 8 to 10 years.

754
00:57:33,194 --> 00:57:37,567
Count eleven, 8 to 10 years.
Count twelve, 8 to 10 years.

755
00:57:37,865 --> 00:57:41,093
Count thirteen, 8 to 10 years,
and count fourteen--

756
00:57:41,288 --> 00:57:43,808
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.

757
00:57:44,008 --> 00:57:45,950
Sentences to run concurrently.

758
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:50,727
Shorty thought he'd given us 100 years,
until I explained "concurrently. "

759
00:57:50,921 --> 00:57:53,310
It meant a minimum of
10 years hard labor...

760
00:57:53,513 --> 00:57:55,748
...at the Charlestown State Prison.

761
00:57:55,943 --> 00:57:58,049
The date was February 1946.

762
00:57:58,248 --> 00:57:59,458
Fuck you.

763
00:58:05,032 --> 00:58:07,170
Cellblock A, secure.

764
00:58:42,822 --> 00:58:44,032
Look at him.

765
00:58:44,231 --> 00:58:45,342
l see him.

766
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,328
He about to bust?

767
00:58:47,526 --> 00:58:50,873
He not gonna bust.
He wouldn't give them the pleasure.

768
00:58:51,526 --> 00:58:52,803
Little!

769
00:58:56,006 --> 00:58:56,769
Your number.

770
00:58:57,254 --> 00:58:58,049
Little!

771
00:58:58,725 --> 00:58:59,357
What?

772
00:58:59,557 --> 00:59:00,572
Give him a break.

773
00:59:00,997 --> 00:59:03,845
-He's a new fish.
-l'll give him a break.

774
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,816
Now state your number, Little.

775
00:59:07,557 --> 00:59:08,188
l forgot it.

776
00:59:08,805 --> 00:59:09,470
State it.

777
00:59:09,668 --> 00:59:10,301
l forgot it.

778
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,093
You can read it!

779
00:59:12,325 --> 00:59:14,016
-Can't you read, boy?
-Fuck you!

780
00:59:14,821 --> 00:59:16,381
l'll teach you a lesson.

781
00:59:19,397 --> 00:59:20,542
l forgot it!

782
00:59:20,995 --> 00:59:22,010
l forgot it!

783
00:59:22,244 --> 00:59:23,421
l forgot it!

784
00:59:28,901 --> 00:59:31,452
They ain't gonna break me down.

785
00:59:35,299 --> 00:59:38,714
l'm in this situation,
and l'm getting out.

786
00:59:39,362 --> 00:59:41,250
Anything go wrong, l'm strong.

787
00:59:42,691 --> 00:59:44,121
Time's up, Little.

788
00:59:44,835 --> 00:59:46,493
Now state your number.

789
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,772
Suit yourself. Ten more days.

790
00:59:55,938 --> 00:59:56,953
Water!

791
00:59:58,562 --> 00:59:59,609
Water!

792
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:17,440
You want a smoke?

793
01:00:25,697 --> 01:00:28,381
You know what a friend
you have in Jesus, son?

794
01:00:28,577 --> 01:00:29,755
A friend?

795
01:00:31,842 --> 01:00:35,005
He's a friend?
lf he's such a friend, where is he?

796
01:00:35,201 --> 01:00:36,378
What's he done for me?

797
01:00:36,578 --> 01:00:37,853
A friend!

798
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,372
Tell you what you do,
you tell him to call me.

799
01:00:42,017 --> 01:00:43,990
Call me and tell me
what kind of friend he is.

800
01:00:44,191 --> 01:00:46,681
Solitary 2-2607.

801
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,920
What he done for me, chappy?

802
01:00:49,121 --> 01:00:51,007
Where is he when l need him?

803
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,876
You tell me that! Where is this Jesus?
l'll tell you where.

804
01:00:55,135 --> 01:00:58,365
He's out with the police captain!
l'll straighten him out!

805
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,527
What's he done for me?
He ain't done nothing for me!

806
01:01:06,014 --> 01:01:09,560
"What a friend we have in Jesus."
Jesus can kiss my ass!

807
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:13,207
Tell Jesus to kiss my ass.
How about that? Tell him that.

808
01:02:04,796 --> 01:02:05,778
Little!

809
01:02:08,316 --> 01:02:09,910
State your number.

810
01:02:10,878 --> 01:02:12,306
Come on, state it!

811
01:02:13,277 --> 01:02:14,770
A-22....

812
01:02:14,972 --> 01:02:15,900
What?

813
01:02:16,092 --> 01:02:17,847
A-228....

814
01:02:19,132 --> 01:02:20,148
Come on.

815
01:02:36,092 --> 01:02:37,520
l know how you feel.

816
01:02:38,074 --> 01:02:39,733
Like you want to lay down and die.

817
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,377
l brought you something.

818
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:46,296
l don't need no more favors from you.

819
01:02:46,492 --> 01:02:47,474
lt's nutmeg.

820
01:02:47,675 --> 01:02:51,897
Put it in the water. You need something
to get the monkey off your back.

821
01:02:52,092 --> 01:02:54,480
lt's not cocaine,
but it'll help some.

822
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:03,668
Drink it slow.
The stuff is strong.

823
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:11,960
So what's your hype?

824
01:03:12,633 --> 01:03:15,797
l can show you how to get out
of prison. And it's no hype.

825
01:03:15,993 --> 01:03:18,066
Talk, daddy-o. l'm listening.

826
01:03:18,969 --> 01:03:22,995
-This ain't bad. You got some more?
-That's the last fix l'm giving you.

827
01:03:23,993 --> 01:03:25,554
So why'd you give it to me?

828
01:03:25,754 --> 01:03:29,746
Because you needed it.
Because you couldn't hear me without it.

829
01:03:31,033 --> 01:03:33,270
Nigger, get on out of my face.

830
01:03:33,497 --> 01:03:36,693
l think you got more sense
than any cat in this prison.

831
01:03:36,888 --> 01:03:38,830
Why the hell don't you use it?

832
01:03:40,152 --> 01:03:43,895
You can't bust out of here
like they do in the movies.

833
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,485
Even if you get out,
you're still in prison.

834
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:47,923
You ain't lying.

835
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:51,917
You'll bang against a stone wall.
You're not using your brain!

836
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,975
That's what the white man wants.

837
01:03:54,201 --> 01:03:57,397
Look at you, putting all
that poison in your hair.

838
01:03:57,592 --> 01:04:01,846
l think you been in prison too long.
Everybody on the outside conks.

839
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:04,243
Why does everybody on the outside conk?

840
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,439
They don't want to walk around
with a nappy head, looking like--

841
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,686
Looking like me?

842
01:04:08,919 --> 01:04:10,196
Like a nigger?

843
01:04:11,638 --> 01:04:13,297
Why not look like what you are?

844
01:04:13,494 --> 01:04:15,918
What makes you ashamed of being black?

845
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:19,435
Let me tell you something.
l'm not ashamed of being anything.

846
01:04:23,255 --> 01:04:25,296
You better let go.
l gotta wash this out.

847
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:28,363
-Let it burn!
-Nigger, get your hands off of me!

848
01:04:29,463 --> 01:04:31,372
Go on. Burn yourself. Pain yourself.

849
01:04:31,574 --> 01:04:35,252
Put all that poison in your hair,
in your body, trying to be white!

850
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:40,241
-l don't want to hear this.
-l thought you were smart.

851
01:04:40,437 --> 01:04:42,739
But you just another cat
strutting down the avenue...

852
01:04:42,934 --> 01:04:45,039
...in your clown suit
with all that mess on you!

853
01:04:45,334 --> 01:04:46,414
Looking like a monkey!

854
01:04:46,614 --> 01:04:50,410
The white man sees you and laughs
because he knows you ain't white.

855
01:04:50,613 --> 01:04:51,441
Who are you?

856
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,809
The question is, who are you?

857
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:56,367
l'll tell you.

858
01:04:57,109 --> 01:04:59,248
You are lost in the darkness.

859
01:05:01,205 --> 01:05:03,757
But Elijah Muhammad has come
to bring you into the light.

860
01:05:03,957 --> 01:05:04,687
Who?

861
01:05:04,884 --> 01:05:06,512
Elijah Muhammad...

862
01:05:06,773 --> 01:05:09,162
...can get you out of prison.

863
01:05:10,037 --> 01:05:12,207
Out of the prison of your mind.

864
01:05:13,012 --> 01:05:15,882
But maybe all you want is another fix.

865
01:05:30,772 --> 01:05:33,292
--you get used to this life,
and it puts you to sleep.

866
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:36,208
You stop thinking and acting
for yourself.

867
01:05:36,882 --> 01:05:40,331
lf you had to scrounge 3 squares a day,
you'd cut your throats.

868
01:05:40,658 --> 01:05:43,822
So you let them feed you,
give you dominoes to play with.

869
01:05:44,018 --> 01:05:47,314
-Let you shoot marbles, play baseball.
-Let's go. Cut the sermon.

870
01:05:47,507 --> 01:05:51,184
He blows his whistle and you sit,
you stand, you grab, gobble...

871
01:05:51,378 --> 01:05:52,361
...file out...

872
01:05:52,563 --> 01:05:54,602
...sleep, and sing out your number.

873
01:05:54,802 --> 01:05:56,558
l told you to knock it off.

874
01:05:58,739 --> 01:05:59,667
Now...

875
01:05:59,859 --> 01:06:01,516
...are you gonna take yard?

876
01:06:03,601 --> 01:06:04,877
l'm staying.

877
01:06:05,681 --> 01:06:06,576
Me too.

878
01:06:17,296 --> 01:06:19,239
What are you sniffing around for?

879
01:06:19,441 --> 01:06:21,994
l told you, l gave you your last fix.

880
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,275
What's your angle, nigger?

881
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:31,402
"Nigger"?
Who's wearing the conk?

882
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:35,080
You the only cat in this prison
l done seen act like you do.

883
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,822
You ain't even afraid of the guards.

884
01:06:39,023 --> 01:06:41,545
What's he gonna do to me
he hasn't done already?

885
01:06:43,377 --> 01:06:47,466
l mean, you don't cuss none. You don't
talk that "What-ya-know-daddy" jive.

886
01:06:47,663 --> 01:06:51,374
A man curses because he doesn't have
the words to say what's on his mind.

887
01:06:56,496 --> 01:06:59,047
l know you got a angle
some kind of way.

888
01:07:00,494 --> 01:07:01,291
Don't con me.

889
01:07:03,216 --> 01:07:05,452
Don't con me and don't try.

890
01:07:07,054 --> 01:07:10,315
Hey, just offering you a cigarette,
my man. Ain't no big deal.

891
01:07:16,048 --> 01:07:17,989
l read, study.

892
01:07:18,255 --> 01:07:21,036
The first thing a black man
must have is self-respect.

893
01:07:21,231 --> 01:07:23,335
Respect his body and his mind.

894
01:07:23,535 --> 01:07:26,022
Quit taking the white man's
poisons into his body.

895
01:07:26,254 --> 01:07:30,727
His cigarettes, his dope, his liquor,
his white women, his pork.

896
01:07:31,533 --> 01:07:32,483
Pork?

897
01:07:36,622 --> 01:07:38,793
My mama used to say don't eat no pork.

898
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:43,245
Your mama was right.
A pig is a filthy beast.

899
01:07:43,438 --> 01:07:46,732
Part rat, part cat
and the rest is dog.

900
01:07:46,925 --> 01:07:49,193
All right, pull my coat on this now.

901
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:51,495
What happen if you give all that up?

902
01:07:51,949 --> 01:07:55,244
l mean, the pork. You get sick
and you get a medical or something?

903
01:07:55,437 --> 01:07:58,786
Like when l was on the outside,
l ran this hustle. l tried--

904
01:07:58,989 --> 01:08:02,186
l'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle.

905
01:08:02,379 --> 01:08:04,007
And l'm gonna tell you...

906
01:08:04,204 --> 01:08:05,132
...God is black.

907
01:08:05,325 --> 01:08:08,073
God is black?
Everybody knows God is white.

908
01:08:08,269 --> 01:08:12,064
You accepted everything the white man
taught. He said you were a heathen...

909
01:08:12,269 --> 01:08:16,164
...and you believed him.
He said Jesus was blond and blue-eyed...

910
01:08:16,365 --> 01:08:17,291
...with white skin...

911
01:08:17,484 --> 01:08:18,827
...and you believed him.

912
01:08:19,467 --> 01:08:22,282
He said that black was a curse
and you believed that.

913
01:08:22,475 --> 01:08:24,898
-Ever look up the word "black"?
-For what?

914
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,336
Did you ever study anything
that wasn't a con?

915
01:08:27,532 --> 01:08:28,993
What the hell for, man?

916
01:08:31,946 --> 01:08:32,711
Come with me.

917
01:08:36,364 --> 01:08:38,852
"Black: Destitute of light...

918
01:08:39,052 --> 01:08:40,361
...devoid of color.

919
01:08:40,812 --> 01:08:42,272
Enveloped in darkness...

920
01:08:42,474 --> 01:08:44,743
...hence utterly dismal or gloomy...

921
01:08:45,195 --> 01:08:46,721
...as, 'The future looked black.' "

922
01:08:46,955 --> 01:08:48,677
Pretty good with them words.

923
01:08:49,035 --> 01:08:50,146
"Soiled with dirt...

924
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:51,520
...foul.

925
01:08:51,722 --> 01:08:52,421
Sullen...

926
01:08:52,619 --> 01:08:53,382
...hostile...

927
01:08:53,578 --> 01:08:56,481
...forbidding, as, 'a black day.'

928
01:08:57,226 --> 01:08:59,910
Foully or outrageously wicked...

929
01:09:00,107 --> 01:09:01,601
...as, 'black cruelty.'

930
01:09:01,802 --> 01:09:05,379
lndicating disgrace,
dishonor or culpability."

931
01:09:06,474 --> 01:09:09,637
And there's others.
"Blackmail. Blackball. Blackguard."

932
01:09:09,834 --> 01:09:11,208
That's something, all right.

933
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:13,119
Let's look up "white."

934
01:09:16,424 --> 01:09:17,440
Here.

935
01:09:18,633 --> 01:09:19,527
Read.

936
01:09:22,345 --> 01:09:23,238
"White:

937
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,335
The color of pure snow.

938
01:09:27,689 --> 01:09:30,406
Reflecting all the rays
of the spectrum.

939
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,000
The opposite of black.

940
01:09:37,063 --> 01:09:39,366
Free from spot or blemish.

941
01:09:41,353 --> 01:09:42,912
lnnocent. Pure."

942
01:09:47,047 --> 01:09:49,504
Ain't this something?
"Without evil intent.

943
01:09:49,704 --> 01:09:50,816
Harmless.

944
01:09:51,272 --> 01:09:52,929
Honest, square-dealing...

945
01:09:53,127 --> 01:09:54,719
...and honorable."
Wait a minute.

946
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:58,018
This was written by white folks, though.

947
01:09:58,247 --> 01:10:00,735
-Sure ain't no black man's book.
-So why read it?

948
01:10:00,936 --> 01:10:03,521
So you can read the truth
behind the words.

949
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:07,679
You got to take everything the white man
says and use it against him.

950
01:10:11,942 --> 01:10:14,082
There's a whole lot of words in here.

951
01:10:14,631 --> 01:10:17,119
Here. Let's start at the beginning.

952
01:10:17,637 --> 01:10:21,435
We'll look them up, write them down
and find out what they mean.

953
01:10:21,703 --> 01:10:24,572
Page one. The first word: "Aardvark."

954
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:29,439
"Aardvark.

955
01:10:29,638 --> 01:10:32,420
Earth pig.
African, ant-eating mammal.

956
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:34,212
Abacus:

957
01:10:34,406 --> 01:10:37,917
Chinese calculating instrument.

958
01:10:40,263 --> 01:10:41,342
Abaddon:

959
01:10:41,542 --> 01:10:44,857
The place of the lost in Sheol.

960
01:10:45,062 --> 01:10:46,403
The bottomless pit."

961
01:10:46,597 --> 01:10:49,018
lf you take one step toward Allah...

962
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:51,130
...he'll take two steps toward you.

963
01:10:56,261 --> 01:10:57,602
Lights out!

964
01:11:35,012 --> 01:11:36,734
Boy'll wear out a baseball.

965
01:11:37,603 --> 01:11:39,545
-What's the score, my man?
-10 to 1.

966
01:11:39,746 --> 01:11:42,233
We're murdering them!
Didn't you hear?

967
01:11:42,466 --> 01:11:43,360
No. What happened?

968
01:11:43,556 --> 01:11:47,614
The Dodgers brought up Jackie Robinson!
We're pouding them, celebrating!

969
01:11:47,811 --> 01:11:49,469
That's all right.

970
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:50,911
Sure.

971
01:11:51,618 --> 01:11:54,619
White man throw us a bone
and we're supposed to forget...

972
01:11:54,818 --> 01:11:56,345
...400 years of oppression.

973
01:11:57,059 --> 01:11:58,487
Yeah, but a nigger--

974
01:11:59,521 --> 01:12:01,855
A Negro in the big leagues,
that's something.

975
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:05,215
l told you to go behind the words
and dig out the truth.

976
01:12:05,538 --> 01:12:08,319
They let us sing and dance
and smile...

977
01:12:08,769 --> 01:12:11,638
...and then they let one
so-called Negro into the majors.

978
01:12:11,842 --> 01:12:14,330
That doesn't cancel out history's
greatest crime.

979
01:12:14,595 --> 01:12:17,495
When that grafted, blue-eyed devil
locked us in chains...

980
01:12:17,697 --> 01:12:20,795
...one hundred million of us,
broke up our families...

981
01:12:20,992 --> 01:12:22,335
...tortured us...

982
01:12:22,529 --> 01:12:26,206
...cut us off from our language,
our religion, our history....

983
01:12:27,905 --> 01:12:30,140
Let me tell you about black history.

984
01:12:30,337 --> 01:12:32,824
We are the original man.

985
01:12:33,025 --> 01:12:35,959
The first men on earth were black.
They ruled.

986
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,844
And there wasn't
a white face anywhere.

987
01:12:39,136 --> 01:12:41,558
But they teach us
that we swung from trees.

988
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,958
That's a lie.
Black men never did that.

989
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:47,608
We were a race of kings
when the white man...

990
01:12:47,808 --> 01:12:49,814
...crawled on all fours in Europe.

991
01:12:50,015 --> 01:12:51,989
Do they know who they are?

992
01:12:53,918 --> 01:12:56,603
Do you know where you came from?
What's your name?

993
01:12:56,832 --> 01:12:57,661
Malcolm Little.

994
01:12:58,783 --> 01:13:01,882
That's the name of the slave masters
that owned your family.

995
01:13:02,655 --> 01:13:04,564
You don't even know who you are.

996
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:07,287
You're nothing.
Less than nothing.

997
01:13:07,487 --> 01:13:08,916
Who are you?

998
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:14,423
Look, l ain't--
Shit!

999
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:21,277
All right, l ain't Malcolm Little.
Or Red. Or Satan.

1000
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:22,932
That's right.
So who are you?

1001
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:29,627
-l don't know.
-We are a nation...

1002
01:13:29,981 --> 01:13:31,803
...of the tribe of Shabazz...

1003
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:35,510
...lost in this wilderness called
North America.

1004
01:13:42,878 --> 01:13:44,120
Tribe of Shabazz.

1005
01:13:44,318 --> 01:13:46,651
The merciful Allah
has sent us a messenger...

1006
01:13:46,845 --> 01:13:49,017
...a black man
named Elijah Muhammad.

1007
01:13:49,469 --> 01:13:52,819
He reveals to us the true
knowledge about ourselves.

1008
01:13:53,085 --> 01:13:56,913
He teaches that the true nature
of the original man, the black man...

1009
01:13:57,148 --> 01:13:58,677
...is righteousness.

1010
01:13:59,132 --> 01:14:01,434
lf the black man's nature
is righteousness....

1011
01:14:01,628 --> 01:14:04,247
Then the true nature of
the white man is wickedness.

1012
01:14:04,443 --> 01:14:05,937
l knew you'd get it.

1013
01:14:06,203 --> 01:14:09,881
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches
that the white man is a devil.

1014
01:14:10,077 --> 01:14:12,443
l sure met some in my life.

1015
01:14:14,363 --> 01:14:18,421
Elijah Muhammad does not say
that some white men are devils.

1016
01:14:18,843 --> 01:14:22,105
He teaches us that
all white men are devils.

1017
01:14:22,683 --> 01:14:26,676
Have you ever known a good white man?
Think back in all your life.

1018
01:14:27,482 --> 01:14:30,037
Have you ever met one
who wasn't evil?

1019
01:14:37,819 --> 01:14:39,445
The body is a sacred temple...

1020
01:14:39,644 --> 01:14:41,815
...it must be purified.

1021
01:14:43,322 --> 01:14:46,040
l will not touch
the white man's poison:

1022
01:14:46,234 --> 01:14:47,576
His drugs...

1023
01:14:47,993 --> 01:14:49,401
...his liquor...

1024
01:14:50,362 --> 01:14:52,467
...his swine...

1025
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:53,713
...his women.

1026
01:14:54,522 --> 01:14:57,074
A Muslim must be strikingly upright...

1027
01:14:57,305 --> 01:14:59,029
...an outstanding example...

1028
01:14:59,226 --> 01:15:02,542
...so that those in the darkness
can see the power of the light.

1029
01:15:04,603 --> 01:15:07,700
l will not commit
adultery or fornication.

1030
01:15:09,241 --> 01:15:10,803
l will not lie...

1031
01:15:11,001 --> 01:15:12,660
...cheat or steal.

1032
01:15:13,945 --> 01:15:16,279
But the key to lslam is submission.

1033
01:15:20,665 --> 01:15:23,981
That is why five times daily,
we turn to Mecca to pray...

1034
01:15:24,185 --> 01:15:26,574
...to bend our knees in submission.

1035
01:15:30,039 --> 01:15:32,278
l can't do that, Brother Baines.

1036
01:15:32,856 --> 01:15:34,962
The lost, found,
must bend their knees...

1037
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,589
...to admit their guilt.

1038
01:15:36,791 --> 01:15:41,298
To implore Allah's forgiveness
is the hardest thing on earth.

1039
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,235
The hardest and the greatest.

1040
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,596
l don't know
what l would say to Allah.

1041
01:15:57,143 --> 01:15:59,477
Have you ever bent your knees?

1042
01:16:02,198 --> 01:16:04,109
Yes, when l was...

1043
01:16:05,142 --> 01:16:07,531
...picking a lock
to rob someone's house.

1044
01:16:07,735 --> 01:16:08,945
Tell Allah that.

1045
01:16:20,118 --> 01:16:23,948
You can grovel and crawl for sin
but not to save your soul?

1046
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:26,093
Pick the lock.
Pick it.

1047
01:16:26,678 --> 01:16:28,271
l want to.

1048
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:33,683
God knows l want to.

1049
01:16:44,212 --> 01:16:47,824
I received a letter that day
from the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1050
01:16:48,085 --> 01:16:50,189
The dear Holy Apostle
wrote to me...

1051
01:16:50,388 --> 01:16:53,106
...a nobody, a junkie, a pimp
and a convict.

1052
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:56,148
I have come to give you...

1053
01:16:56,566 --> 01:17:00,077
...something which can
never be taken away from you.

1054
01:17:00,308 --> 01:17:05,042
I bring to you
a sense of your own worth...

1055
01:17:05,844 --> 01:17:08,495
...the worth of one human being.

1056
01:17:08,692 --> 01:17:11,081
The knowledge of self.

1057
01:17:11,284 --> 01:17:15,407
It was like a blinding light. I was
aware that he was in the room with me.

1058
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:18,770
He wore a dark suit,
and on his face I saw a wisdom...

1059
01:17:18,963 --> 01:17:22,476
...and pain so old and deep
that I could scarcely look at him.

1060
01:17:23,444 --> 01:17:26,094
But I knew I wasn't dreaming.
He was there with me.

1061
01:17:26,292 --> 01:17:28,080
I tell you...

1062
01:17:29,427 --> 01:17:32,624
...the most dangerous creation
in the world...

1063
01:17:32,946 --> 01:17:35,118
...in any society...

1064
01:17:35,667 --> 01:17:38,155
...is the man with nothing to lose.

1065
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:43,121
You do not need 10 such men
to change the world.

1066
01:17:43,986 --> 01:17:45,895
One will do.

1067
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:49,744
The earth belongs to us...

1068
01:17:49,938 --> 01:17:51,280
...the black man.

1069
01:17:51,602 --> 01:17:53,871
And whatever is around it...

1070
01:17:54,065 --> 01:17:56,935
...or on it, or in it...

1071
01:17:57,201 --> 01:17:59,143
...belongs to us.

1072
01:17:59,346 --> 01:18:01,419
And then as suddenly as he came...

1073
01:18:01,617 --> 01:18:02,698
...he was gone.

1074
01:18:04,754 --> 01:18:06,248
And then I could do it.

1075
01:18:09,041 --> 01:18:10,286
We're taught that Paul...

1076
01:18:10,482 --> 01:18:13,710
...on the road to Damascus,
heard the voice of Christ.

1077
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:16,817
He was so smitten by the truth
that he fell from his horse.

1078
01:18:17,008 --> 01:18:19,081
Now, I don't liken myself to Paul...

1079
01:18:19,345 --> 01:18:20,937
...but I do understand.

1080
01:18:22,449 --> 01:18:23,943
You see, it happened to me.

1081
01:18:24,144 --> 01:18:25,192
Why me?

1082
01:18:26,928 --> 01:18:31,401
Dear Brother Malcolm: I am back
in the bosom of Islam, praise Allah.

1083
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:34,795
We don't have much,
but what we have is yours.

1084
01:18:34,992 --> 01:18:38,734
My wife and my sonjoin me in saying
that when you come out...

1085
01:18:38,927 --> 01:18:41,165
...which won't be long,
come straight to us.

1086
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:42,287
Next.

1087
01:18:48,367 --> 01:18:49,798
What'll it be?

1088
01:18:51,408 --> 01:18:52,750
Take it all off.

1089
01:18:52,944 --> 01:18:55,332
-Getting rid of that conk, huh?
-Yes, sir.

1090
01:18:56,783 --> 01:18:58,757
You write, thanking me.

1091
01:18:59,662 --> 01:19:03,721
Don't thank me, thank Allah.
He did it all.

1092
01:19:06,318 --> 01:19:07,878
Dear Brother Baines:

1093
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:11,079
Please thank Elijah Muhammad
for the money...

1094
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:14,027
...and tell him
I haven't written him...

1095
01:19:14,222 --> 01:19:16,109
...because I've
not yet proven myself.

1096
01:19:16,302 --> 01:19:20,360
But I have shared his teachings
with old running buddies in Harlem...

1097
01:19:20,557 --> 01:19:23,854
...and with my main man, Shorty,
who was transferred upstate.

1098
01:19:24,047 --> 01:19:25,257
He's gone nuts.

1099
01:19:25,455 --> 01:19:26,829
"Dear Brothers:

1100
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:29,637
l thank you for
your time and concern.

1101
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:34,284
All praises due to Allah
for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1102
01:19:34,606 --> 01:19:37,191
l wrote the mayor, the governor
and the President...

1103
01:19:37,388 --> 01:19:40,552
...but for some reason
l haven't heard from them."

1104
01:19:41,742 --> 01:19:43,334
Please tell Elijah...

1105
01:19:43,534 --> 01:19:47,974
...I have dedicated my life to telling
the white devil the truth to his face.

1106
01:19:48,172 --> 01:19:52,068
I greet you with the ancient words
ofpeace, "As-Salaam-Alaikum. "

1107
01:19:52,653 --> 01:19:55,750
P. S. I finally copied out the
entire dictionary.

1108
01:19:57,293 --> 01:20:00,391
l think the brother is coming along.

1109
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:05,446
"The thief cometh not
but for to steal...

1110
01:20:05,708 --> 01:20:09,221
...and to kill, and to destroy.

1111
01:20:09,547 --> 01:20:11,140
But l am come...

1112
01:20:11,692 --> 01:20:13,350
...that they might have life...

1113
01:20:14,091 --> 01:20:17,441
...and that they might have it
more abundantly."

1114
01:20:18,891 --> 01:20:22,536
Saint John 10, verse 10.
Are there any questions?

1115
01:20:26,698 --> 01:20:29,284
Watch it, baby.
This cat is heavy on religion.

1116
01:20:31,595 --> 01:20:34,247
l see this has become a struggle
between good and evil.

1117
01:20:34,443 --> 01:20:35,686
"Satan" has a question.

1118
01:20:36,811 --> 01:20:39,231
Yes, sir. But since
neither of us are God...

1119
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:42,401
...neither of us can say
who's good and who's evil.

1120
01:20:42,603 --> 01:20:43,780
Just ask your question.

1121
01:20:43,977 --> 01:20:47,491
We were discussing the Disciples.
What color were they?

1122
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:50,078
Well, l don't think...

1123
01:20:50,538 --> 01:20:51,815
...we know for certain.

1124
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:53,985
-But they were Hebrews?
-That's right.

1125
01:20:54,184 --> 01:20:56,161
As was Jesus.
Jesus was also a Hebrew.

1126
01:20:57,450 --> 01:20:58,791
Just ask your question.

1127
01:20:58,985 --> 01:21:00,359
What color were the Hebrews?

1128
01:21:00,554 --> 01:21:03,868
l have told you that
we don't know that for certain.

1129
01:21:04,074 --> 01:21:08,001
Then you can't believe for certain
that Jesus was white.

1130
01:21:08,201 --> 01:21:10,405
Just a moment. Just a moment.

1131
01:21:11,528 --> 01:21:14,375
God is white.
lsn't it obvious?

1132
01:21:14,568 --> 01:21:17,286
That's obvious, but it's
not obvious that God is white.

1133
01:21:17,481 --> 01:21:19,007
Elijah Muhammad teaches us...

1134
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,696
...that Jesus didn't have
blond hair and blue eyes.

1135
01:21:21,896 --> 01:21:24,351
Elijah Muhammad teaches that
images of Jesus...

1136
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:27,235
...in prisons and churches
throughout the world...

1137
01:21:27,433 --> 01:21:29,058
...are not historically correct.

1138
01:21:29,257 --> 01:21:30,882
Because history teaches us...

1139
01:21:31,079 --> 01:21:34,113
...Jesus was born in a region where
the people had color.

1140
01:21:34,312 --> 01:21:36,734
There's proof in the Bible
you ask us to read...

1141
01:21:36,936 --> 01:21:39,686
...in Revelations, chapter 1,
verses 14 and 15...

1142
01:21:39,879 --> 01:21:41,701
...that Jesus had hair like wool...

1143
01:21:41,895 --> 01:21:43,619
...and feet the color of brass.

1144
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:46,303
-What're you saying?
-l'm not saying anything.

1145
01:21:46,504 --> 01:21:50,300
l'm proving to you that Jesus was not,
to quote an lndian brother...

1146
01:21:50,504 --> 01:21:52,893
...he was not a paleface.

1147
01:21:54,855 --> 01:21:55,454
Amen.

1148
01:21:56,231 --> 01:21:57,890
lsn't that interesting!

1149
01:22:01,224 --> 01:22:02,500
Brother Malcolm.

1150
01:22:02,822 --> 01:22:04,099
Brother Malcolm.

1151
01:22:05,478 --> 01:22:07,454
He's waiting for you.

1152
01:22:50,404 --> 01:22:52,095
My son....

1153
01:22:54,757 --> 01:22:57,690
You have been a thief...

1154
01:22:58,403 --> 01:23:01,122
...a drug dealer and a hustler...

1155
01:23:02,501 --> 01:23:05,370
...and the world
is still full of temptation.

1156
01:23:09,861 --> 01:23:14,365
When God spoke to the devil about
how faithful Job was...

1157
01:23:14,596 --> 01:23:15,838
...the devil argued...

1158
01:23:16,035 --> 01:23:19,002
...that it was only
God's protective hedge around him...

1159
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:21,472
...that kept him pure.

1160
01:23:22,051 --> 01:23:23,480
ln fact, the devil said:

1161
01:23:23,684 --> 01:23:28,059
"Remove that hedge
and he will curse his Maker."

1162
01:23:29,602 --> 01:23:30,814
Well, Malcolm...

1163
01:23:32,483 --> 01:23:35,297
...your hedge has been removed.

1164
01:23:37,698 --> 01:23:40,086
And l believe...

1165
01:23:41,379 --> 01:23:42,393
...you...

1166
01:23:43,298 --> 01:23:44,924
...will remain faithful.

1167
01:23:45,570 --> 01:23:46,813
Yes, sir.

1168
01:23:51,106 --> 01:23:52,122
Thank you, sister.

1169
01:23:52,323 --> 01:23:53,882
How many of these should we make?

1170
01:23:54,082 --> 01:23:55,642
-Five hundred.
-Make it 1000.

1171
01:23:56,193 --> 01:23:59,870
Brother Malcolm, this is Brother Earl.
He just accepted the teachings.

1172
01:24:02,242 --> 01:24:04,958
Brother Earl's dedicated.
We need good men like him.

1173
01:24:05,282 --> 01:24:08,314
l'm a willing servant for
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1174
01:24:08,577 --> 01:24:10,333
Go ahead, brothers.
lKeep it busy.

1175
01:24:10,912 --> 01:24:13,499
Take a real good look
at not just where you live...

1176
01:24:13,698 --> 01:24:16,861
...but take a good look
at where everybody you know lives.

1177
01:24:17,056 --> 01:24:20,220
l don't want you to think
you're some bad-luck accident.

1178
01:24:20,416 --> 01:24:23,319
Then l want you to go downtown,
to Central Park West....

1179
01:24:26,336 --> 01:24:27,579
Go in other communities....

1180
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:30,591
You've never seen
a Booker T. Washington store...

1181
01:24:30,784 --> 01:24:32,158
...in an ltalian community.

1182
01:24:32,352 --> 01:24:35,319
You've never seen no
Frederick Douglass delicatessen...

1183
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,796
...in the Jewish community.

1184
01:24:36,993 --> 01:24:40,375
Why's everybody in this community
making money but us?

1185
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,444
lt's time for black men and women
to stand up...

1186
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:45,589
...and take control of our dollars.

1187
01:24:45,791 --> 01:24:49,468
lt's time for us to use our dollars
for our liberation.

1188
01:24:49,664 --> 01:24:52,979
We can do what everyone else can
if we become producers...

1189
01:24:53,183 --> 01:24:56,031
...and if we become
the masters of our own destiny.

1190
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:58,841
We can have wool from sheep
just like anyone else.

1191
01:24:59,038 --> 01:25:00,860
But where are our clothing stores?

1192
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:05,178
We can get milk from cows,
but where are our grocery stores?

1193
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:09,085
We need to control our dollars!
We need to control our destiny!

1194
01:25:09,278 --> 01:25:12,245
The only thing they respect
is our dollars!

1195
01:25:14,366 --> 01:25:16,602
--the so-called freedom
we should have.

1196
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:18,902
The Statue of Liberty
stands like this.

1197
01:25:19,102 --> 01:25:22,134
For us, it may as well say,
"Stop, don't come no further."

1198
01:25:23,645 --> 01:25:25,370
"Don't come no further."

1199
01:25:25,566 --> 01:25:27,606
Brothers and sisters,
l want you to....

1200
01:25:27,806 --> 01:25:29,813
l want you to come down
to the temple.

1201
01:25:30,013 --> 01:25:31,606
Oh, l'm so surprised!

1202
01:25:31,805 --> 01:25:34,772
l'm so surprised.
You all been in church two hours...

1203
01:25:34,973 --> 01:25:38,552
...expecting to see heaven,
but you're still here on earth.

1204
01:25:38,749 --> 01:25:41,237
Why don't you come on down
to the temple at 2:00?

1205
01:25:41,437 --> 01:25:43,575
You'll hear truth,
the black man's truth.

1206
01:25:43,772 --> 01:25:47,515
No, you can't deny it.
You been on your knees for hours...

1207
01:25:47,709 --> 01:25:49,880
...begging some God to help you
in the hereafter.

1208
01:25:50,077 --> 01:25:53,459
But the hereafter is right now.
The hereafter is here and now.

1209
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:55,317
Let me talk to you, brother.

1210
01:25:55,515 --> 01:25:58,265
l know you're a smart man
and a wise man.

1211
01:25:58,461 --> 01:25:59,354
You look good.

1212
01:25:59,548 --> 01:26:02,865
Now, you're in church every day,
praying to this God.

1213
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:05,074
But these so-called white Christians...

1214
01:26:05,276 --> 01:26:07,578
...hang our black Christians
from trees.

1215
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:11,215
This man hates you.
He doesn't do anything for you.

1216
01:26:11,419 --> 01:26:13,656
He tells you to foam at
the mouth and sing...

1217
01:26:13,851 --> 01:26:16,153
...and hope for something
in the hereafter.

1218
01:26:16,347 --> 01:26:17,558
We can have it now.

1219
01:26:17,756 --> 01:26:19,893
-Come on down, 2:00.
-See you later.

1220
01:26:20,091 --> 01:26:23,189
As-Salaam-Alaikum
That means, "Peace be unto you."

1221
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:26,322
We have two children.
Carla, who's two, and....

1222
01:26:26,523 --> 01:26:29,141
Don't be ashamed when l call
you black. You are.

1223
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:32,209
You're black and you're beautiful.
Black is beautiful.

1224
01:26:32,411 --> 01:26:35,639
You don't have to come here
begging these folks for a job.

1225
01:26:35,834 --> 01:26:38,682
You can wash their clothes
and scrub floors for them.

1226
01:26:38,875 --> 01:26:41,941
You can rock their little
brats to sleep your whole life.

1227
01:26:42,138 --> 01:26:43,632
You'll still end up poor.

1228
01:26:43,833 --> 01:26:46,703
Yet you're here on the auction block
being examined...

1229
01:26:46,906 --> 01:26:48,979
...like you're a horse or a slave.

1230
01:26:49,177 --> 01:26:52,079
You see this here?
This is who you are. Beautiful.

1231
01:26:52,281 --> 01:26:55,730
Your beautiful black selves,
with pride and dignity.

1232
01:26:58,233 --> 01:27:01,135
l'd also expect you to work one
Saturday every month...

1233
01:27:01,338 --> 01:27:03,955
...and occasionally in the evening--

1234
01:27:09,432 --> 01:27:13,207
See, these are the questions
you and l have to ask:

1235
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,807
"How did we get this mind?"

1236
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,677
You're not an American, but an African
who happens to be in America.

1237
01:27:18,935 --> 01:27:20,595
You must understand the difference.

1238
01:27:20,793 --> 01:27:24,141
We didn't come over on the Nina,
the Pinta and the whatchamacallit.

1239
01:27:24,376 --> 01:27:27,988
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock.
Plymouth Rock landed on us.

1240
01:27:28,344 --> 01:27:30,765
Landed right on top of us.

1241
01:27:33,273 --> 01:27:34,200
Shorty?

1242
01:27:35,255 --> 01:27:36,749
ls that you, brother?

1243
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:40,727
Now, this is exactly what l'm talking
about, the slave mentality...

1244
01:27:40,919 --> 01:27:41,934
...the slave mind.

1245
01:27:42,135 --> 01:27:43,958
This brother and l had
the slave mind.

1246
01:27:44,152 --> 01:27:46,934
We used to rob together.
We slept with white women.

1247
01:27:47,126 --> 01:27:48,719
We even went to prison together.

1248
01:27:48,919 --> 01:27:51,822
Don't be surprised.
Some of you are still in prison...

1249
01:27:52,055 --> 01:27:53,365
...prisons of your mind.

1250
01:27:53,559 --> 01:27:55,184
Stand up, brother.
Come on.

1251
01:27:56,695 --> 01:27:58,484
The brother's a little shy.

1252
01:27:58,678 --> 01:28:00,750
Come on, brother.
Give me a hug.

1253
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:04,204
That's all right, brother.

1254
01:28:05,622 --> 01:28:07,510
Look, he's still got his hair fried.

1255
01:28:07,703 --> 01:28:10,352
That's the slave mind.

1256
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:13,551
Red, that's the best preacher hype
l ever did hear.

1257
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:15,538
No hype, brother.
lt's the truth.

1258
01:28:15,734 --> 01:28:17,708
Come back to the temple
and hear more.

1259
01:28:17,909 --> 01:28:19,600
l can't pay that shit no mind.

1260
01:28:19,797 --> 01:28:22,100
You need to pay it all your mind.
What's left.

1261
01:28:22,292 --> 01:28:24,596
Take it easy.
This is me. Shorty.

1262
01:28:24,789 --> 01:28:26,416
Let's go around the corner....

1263
01:28:27,892 --> 01:28:31,089
No, sir. Not anymore.
l've been clean for eight years.

1264
01:28:31,284 --> 01:28:32,846
-Eight years?
-Eight years.

1265
01:28:33,045 --> 01:28:36,906
My trouble is, l love pigs feet
and white women too much.

1266
01:28:37,174 --> 01:28:39,311
So l damn sure can't be no Muslim.

1267
01:28:39,509 --> 01:28:43,251
That's because you're lost, brother.
That's because you're lost.

1268
01:28:43,734 --> 01:28:45,326
But we can find you.

1269
01:28:49,428 --> 01:28:51,337
What do you hear about
the old gang?

1270
01:28:51,892 --> 01:28:53,320
You heard about Sammy?

1271
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:57,875
Dead. Knocked over in bed with
a chick 25 years younger than he was.

1272
01:28:58,067 --> 01:29:02,801
Had 25 grand in his pocket, also.
Guess it was his lucky number.

1273
01:29:03,315 --> 01:29:05,803
What about....

1274
01:29:06,004 --> 01:29:07,148
What was his name?

1275
01:29:07,349 --> 01:29:08,723
Cadillac?

1276
01:29:08,915 --> 01:29:09,930
Gone too?

1277
01:29:10,131 --> 01:29:14,124
Hooked on heroin. Been in and out
of Lexington five or six times.

1278
01:29:14,322 --> 01:29:15,120
Sophia?

1279
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:17,617
Still happily married
to that rich ofay.

1280
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:19,884
-She married him?
-She married him.

1281
01:29:20,307 --> 01:29:21,736
Went for the money.

1282
01:29:22,034 --> 01:29:24,401
-The money.
-Thank you, honey.

1283
01:29:25,907 --> 01:29:27,630
l haven't seen
West lndian Archie.

1284
01:29:27,826 --> 01:29:30,575
Grapevine says
he's living in the Bronx.

1285
01:29:30,771 --> 01:29:32,592
If you wanna call that living.

1286
01:29:32,787 --> 01:29:34,477
It's been good seeing you.

1287
01:29:34,675 --> 01:29:36,201
Same here, Red.

1288
01:29:42,355 --> 01:29:46,861
Get the hell away from me, bitch!

1289
01:29:50,258 --> 01:29:52,624
l'll pay you tomorrow!

1290
01:30:06,546 --> 01:30:07,658
How you doing, Archie?

1291
01:30:08,145 --> 01:30:09,901
My man, Red.

1292
01:30:12,465 --> 01:30:13,893
Come here, man.

1293
01:30:18,065 --> 01:30:20,203
No, don't get up.
lt's all right.

1294
01:30:27,665 --> 01:30:28,940
ls...

1295
01:30:30,927 --> 01:30:32,683
...really you, Red?

1296
01:30:33,743 --> 01:30:35,085
Yes, it's me.

1297
01:30:39,345 --> 01:30:41,001
l came to...

1298
01:30:41,807 --> 01:30:43,334
...just to thank you...

1299
01:30:45,103 --> 01:30:46,729
...for saving my life.

1300
01:30:46,927 --> 01:30:50,342
When l think back to when
we were in Harlem trying to...

1301
01:30:50,671 --> 01:30:52,012
...gun each other down--

1302
01:30:52,206 --> 01:30:54,346
l wasn't going to shoot you, man.

1303
01:30:55,887 --> 01:30:56,835
lt was...

1304
01:30:57,453 --> 01:30:58,917
...just my rep.

1305
01:30:59,822 --> 01:31:00,771
You know?

1306
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:04,842
All l had was my rep.

1307
01:31:06,445 --> 01:31:07,492
But now...

1308
01:31:09,775 --> 01:31:11,017
...you tell me this.

1309
01:31:11,502 --> 01:31:14,536
You did really have that number?

1310
01:31:16,333 --> 01:31:18,058
l don't know, Archie....

1311
01:31:18,381 --> 01:31:20,324
l don't remember,
and it's not important.

1312
01:31:20,526 --> 01:31:24,202
The important thing now
is to get you back on your feet.

1313
01:31:25,581 --> 01:31:27,970
You know, l have some angles...

1314
01:31:29,869 --> 01:31:31,593
...ain't been figured yet.

1315
01:31:39,244 --> 01:31:40,325
lt's all right.

1316
01:31:45,133 --> 01:31:47,074
Help me with my arm.

1317
01:31:48,491 --> 01:31:50,695
l need to exercise my arm.

1318
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,143
That's better?

1319
01:31:59,339 --> 01:32:01,544
Yep.
lt feels good.

1320
01:32:01,741 --> 01:32:03,714
Good.

1321
01:32:07,563 --> 01:32:11,786
What happened to our women?
They could've been doctors, lawyers...

1322
01:32:11,979 --> 01:32:15,046
...or teachers or mothers.
Who'll raise our children?

1323
01:32:15,244 --> 01:32:16,738
What happened to our men?

1324
01:32:16,939 --> 01:32:20,964
Men who could've been mathematicians,
electricians, physicians.

1325
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:23,431
What's the little boy gonna do...

1326
01:32:23,627 --> 01:32:26,562
...when he's looking for his father
who's in jail?

1327
01:32:26,890 --> 01:32:28,100
What'll the girl do...

1328
01:32:28,298 --> 01:32:31,974
...when she's looking for her mother
who's out selling herself?

1329
01:32:32,171 --> 01:32:36,808
I'm telling you, that devil has made
dead souls out of you and I.

1330
01:32:37,193 --> 01:32:38,721
You're dead, spiritually.

1331
01:32:38,922 --> 01:32:42,499
You're dead to the knowledge
of yourself and your people...

1332
01:32:42,698 --> 01:32:44,901
...and to the knowledge
of your God.

1333
01:32:45,098 --> 01:32:48,098
Why, he should get down on his knees.

1334
01:32:48,298 --> 01:32:49,377
He should beg our mercy.

1335
01:32:50,216 --> 01:32:51,710
Oh, my brothers and sisters...

1336
01:32:51,913 --> 01:32:54,435
...his kind has committed
God's greatest crime...

1337
01:32:54,634 --> 01:32:58,016
...against your and my kind
every day of his life!

1338
01:32:58,218 --> 01:33:01,763
He should get on his knees
and say he's committed a crime.

1339
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:02,975
But does he do that?

1340
01:33:03,176 --> 01:33:06,177
Does he do that?
No, no, he scorns you.

1341
01:33:06,378 --> 01:33:08,482
He splits your head with
his nightstick.

1342
01:33:08,681 --> 01:33:11,169
He busts you in the head
with his billy club.

1343
01:33:11,369 --> 01:33:12,962
And he calls you a nigger...

1344
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:16,869
...a coon. That's what he says to you.
"Boy!" "Nigger!"

1345
01:33:17,065 --> 01:33:18,974
Four hundred years is long enough.

1346
01:33:19,175 --> 01:33:22,492
You've sat down and laid down
and bowed down for 400 years.

1347
01:33:22,696 --> 01:33:26,243
l think it's time to stand up.
l think it's time to stand up.

1348
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:28,196
-We're with you!
-All right.

1349
01:33:28,393 --> 01:33:29,286
Bless you.

1350
01:33:36,008 --> 01:33:38,592
Glory! My Lord!
Praise Him!

1351
01:33:52,231 --> 01:33:54,019
Yes, sir.
Next Wednesday, 8:00.

1352
01:33:54,214 --> 01:33:55,557
l'll see you there.

1353
01:33:56,774 --> 01:33:58,717
Brother Baines?
Excuse me, sister.

1354
01:33:58,918 --> 01:34:01,854
Do you think we can get
a loudspeaker set up outside?

1355
01:34:02,055 --> 01:34:03,233
l'm sure we can.

1356
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:05,437
Brother Malcolm,
this is Sister Betty.

1357
01:34:05,638 --> 01:34:08,256
She lectures our Muslim women
on hygiene and diet.

1358
01:34:08,454 --> 01:34:11,453
She stresses care for the body
and regular eating habits.

1359
01:34:11,718 --> 01:34:12,862
Good.

1360
01:34:13,062 --> 01:34:15,713
-As-Salaam-Alaikum.
-Alaikum-Salaam, sister.

1361
01:34:17,382 --> 01:34:18,810
Brother Minister...

1362
01:34:19,014 --> 01:34:22,309
...the sister wonders if you know
what Harriet Tubman did...

1363
01:34:22,502 --> 01:34:25,371
...between taking souls to the
Promised Land?

1364
01:34:25,572 --> 01:34:27,713
No. What's that, sister?

1365
01:34:28,998 --> 01:34:30,372
She ate.

1366
01:34:33,636 --> 01:34:34,913
Excuse me.

1367
01:34:43,653 --> 01:34:44,731
She's interesting.

1368
01:34:44,933 --> 01:34:48,161
Minister, l was hoping
you'd come and speak to my class.

1369
01:34:49,381 --> 01:34:51,169
Yes, l'll speak to your class.

1370
01:34:51,972 --> 01:34:54,622
-But l'm a hard man on the women.
-Are you?

1371
01:34:55,332 --> 01:34:57,753
We must be very careful
when it comes to women.

1372
01:34:57,956 --> 01:35:00,192
Too many of our women...

1373
01:35:01,219 --> 01:35:03,128
...have too much
of the devil in them.

1374
01:35:03,523 --> 01:35:05,564
Bleaching and dyeing...

1375
01:35:07,042 --> 01:35:09,247
...and ironing their hair.

1376
01:35:10,212 --> 01:35:14,074
Running around
in the streets half-naked.

1377
01:35:16,067 --> 01:35:17,278
Talking too much.

1378
01:35:17,474 --> 01:35:19,035
Listening to the wrong men...

1379
01:35:19,235 --> 01:35:22,650
...making them
deceitful, untrustworthy, fresh.

1380
01:35:22,851 --> 01:35:25,086
And you men are to blame too.

1381
01:35:25,283 --> 01:35:28,991
We don't protect, we don't value,
we don't even support them.

1382
01:35:29,539 --> 01:35:31,164
See, the building of
a new nation...

1383
01:35:32,193 --> 01:35:33,949
...begins with the woman.

1384
01:35:34,434 --> 01:35:36,124
Because the mother...

1385
01:35:36,513 --> 01:35:38,847
...is the first teacher of the child.

1386
01:35:39,073 --> 01:35:42,619
The message she gives that child,
the child gives to the world.

1387
01:35:43,394 --> 01:35:46,656
When it comes to choosing a mate...

1388
01:35:47,169 --> 01:35:51,360
...Samson, the strongest man
that ever lived, was destroyed...

1389
01:35:51,554 --> 01:35:53,943
...by the woman
that slept in his arms.

1390
01:35:54,145 --> 01:35:56,511
Should l tell my sisters, then...

1391
01:35:56,768 --> 01:35:59,071
...that we don't believe in marriage?

1392
01:35:59,264 --> 01:36:01,753
No, we don't oppose marriage.

1393
01:36:01,952 --> 01:36:03,708
We're not Catholic priests.

1394
01:36:03,905 --> 01:36:05,596
We don't believe in celibacy.

1395
01:36:05,793 --> 01:36:07,963
Mr. Muhammad teaches
that if a woman...

1396
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:10,779
...is the right height
and complexion for a man--

1397
01:36:10,977 --> 01:36:12,254
lf she's...

1398
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,138
...half the man's age, plus seven.

1399
01:36:16,456 --> 01:36:17,917
And if...

1400
01:36:18,119 --> 01:36:22,559
...she understands that man's
essential nature is strong...

1401
01:36:22,887 --> 01:36:24,828
...and she's
willing to support that.

1402
01:36:25,351 --> 01:36:26,813
And if she...

1403
01:36:27,302 --> 01:36:29,636
...can sew and cook and...

1404
01:36:30,183 --> 01:36:31,393
...loves children...

1405
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:33,566
...and stays out of trouble....

1406
01:36:33,767 --> 01:36:36,700
l think you've made your points,
Brother Minister.

1407
01:36:36,902 --> 01:36:37,829
Good.

1408
01:36:38,022 --> 01:36:40,389
You haven't any time for marriage.

1409
01:36:42,118 --> 01:36:45,434
So what l'll do is
write the chapters down for you...

1410
01:36:45,797 --> 01:36:46,627
All right.

1411
01:36:46,823 --> 01:36:49,986
...as well as the New Testament
chapters in St. Matthew.

1412
01:36:50,277 --> 01:36:51,520
Brother Minister....

1413
01:36:51,717 --> 01:36:54,368
l hope you'll still
come visit my class, though.

1414
01:36:54,565 --> 01:36:57,434
No, l'd love to come to your class.
l love to teach.

1415
01:36:57,766 --> 01:37:01,114
l love sharing. This is the wonderful
thing about Mr. Muhammad:

1416
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:05,473
When he gives you this knowledge,
you can't help but share it--

1417
01:37:05,670 --> 01:37:08,320
Excuse me, Brother Minister...

1418
01:37:08,517 --> 01:37:10,142
...would it be okay if we...

1419
01:37:10,341 --> 01:37:12,129
...just sat down for a moment?

1420
01:37:12,324 --> 01:37:14,713
lt's a big building and....

1421
01:37:16,516 --> 01:37:19,648
Sister, l'm sorry.
l've had you on your feet all day.

1422
01:37:20,483 --> 01:37:21,596
My mistake.

1423
01:37:21,796 --> 01:37:23,933
You've been on your feet for days.

1424
01:37:24,932 --> 01:37:28,227
And you didn't even finish your salad.

1425
01:37:30,659 --> 01:37:32,961
So let's talk about you
for a change.

1426
01:37:33,475 --> 01:37:34,753
How tall are you?

1427
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:37,372
Why do you ask?

1428
01:37:37,571 --> 01:37:38,748
ldle question.

1429
01:37:39,299 --> 01:37:43,521
Well, if it's just an idle question,
l hope l'm not forced to answer.

1430
01:37:44,483 --> 01:37:47,035
No, l won't force you.

1431
01:37:51,874 --> 01:37:55,322
Brother Baines says that
l'm tall enough for a tall man.

1432
01:37:55,523 --> 01:37:57,279
He's briefed you also?

1433
01:37:59,459 --> 01:38:00,953
How old are you, sister?

1434
01:38:01,730 --> 01:38:04,861
You know, there are
a few things about women...

1435
01:38:05,058 --> 01:38:06,968
...that you don't understand.

1436
01:38:07,171 --> 01:38:10,334
Some of us, we're
quite possessive, very vain...

1437
01:38:11,042 --> 01:38:14,238
...and persistent when
we've set our mind to something.

1438
01:38:14,753 --> 01:38:17,120
What have you set your mind to?

1439
01:38:19,170 --> 01:38:20,827
Being a good Muslim...

1440
01:38:21,633 --> 01:38:23,292
...a good nurse...

1441
01:38:24,993 --> 01:38:26,487
...and a good wife.

1442
01:38:27,394 --> 01:38:28,637
Brother Malcolm?

1443
01:38:28,833 --> 01:38:30,295
-Excuse me.
-Certainly.

1444
01:38:30,498 --> 01:38:33,017
Brother Johnson was attacked
by the police.

1445
01:38:34,976 --> 01:38:35,805
Excuse me.

1446
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,824
-A scuffle!
-He was just watching.

1447
01:38:38,017 --> 01:38:41,180
-The cop said, "Move on!"
-He didn't move quick enough for him.

1448
01:38:41,377 --> 01:38:43,514
Crack! He was bleeding
like a stuck hog.

1449
01:38:43,712 --> 01:38:45,785
So what you gonna do?

1450
01:38:46,464 --> 01:38:49,246
He'll rap a little.
He's a Muslim!

1451
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:52,256
But you ain't gonna do nothing
but make a speech.

1452
01:38:52,704 --> 01:38:55,834
Muslims talk a good game,
but they never do nothing...

1453
01:38:56,288 --> 01:38:58,906
...unless somebody bothers Muslims.

1454
01:39:18,847 --> 01:39:20,538
We demand to see Brother Johnson.

1455
01:39:20,735 --> 01:39:22,457
Who the hell are you?

1456
01:39:22,654 --> 01:39:24,476
The minister
of Muslim Temple No. 7.

1457
01:39:24,670 --> 01:39:26,262
Never heard of you.

1458
01:39:26,493 --> 01:39:27,901
-Where is he?
-Not here.

1459
01:39:28,094 --> 01:39:30,234
Wait a second.
What is your name?

1460
01:39:30,431 --> 01:39:32,633
Don't worry about what my name is.

1461
01:39:32,830 --> 01:39:36,442
Two witnesses saw Johnson brought here
beat up, but not brought out.

1462
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:39,638
You didn't hear the sergeant?
Outside!

1463
01:39:39,838 --> 01:39:42,260
l suggest you look outside
that window.

1464
01:39:53,118 --> 01:39:54,546
Jimmy, come here a second.

1465
01:39:54,749 --> 01:39:57,051
We intend to see Brother Johnson.

1466
01:39:57,820 --> 01:39:58,932
Who the hell are they?

1467
01:39:59,133 --> 01:40:01,403
They're brothers of Brother Johnson.

1468
01:40:05,341 --> 01:40:07,379
Eddie, let me take a look
at that blotter.

1469
01:40:16,989 --> 01:40:19,257
We got a Muslim.
Relief must've put it down.

1470
01:40:19,451 --> 01:40:21,361
-Must have.
-But you can't see him.

1471
01:40:21,564 --> 01:40:24,379
-Because you ain't his lawyer.
-No lawyer, no see.

1472
01:40:24,573 --> 01:40:28,762
Until l'm satisfied that Johnson
is receiving proper medical care...

1473
01:40:28,956 --> 01:40:30,549
...nobody will move.

1474
01:40:44,987 --> 01:40:46,874
Get an ambulance. Now!

1475
01:41:04,761 --> 01:41:06,768
Break it up. You got what you wanted.

1476
01:41:06,970 --> 01:41:09,336
No, l'm not satisfied.

1477
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:11,190
To the hospital.

1478
01:43:06,036 --> 01:43:09,071
We want justice!
We want justice!

1479
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:11,155
All right, that's enough.

1480
01:43:11,348 --> 01:43:12,941
Move these people out of here.

1481
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:17,449
Fruit of lslam are disciplined men.
They haven't broken any laws...yet.

1482
01:43:17,651 --> 01:43:18,514
What about them?

1483
01:43:18,708 --> 01:43:20,235
That's your headache.

1484
01:43:20,437 --> 01:43:22,574
But if Brother Johnson dies,
l pity you.

1485
01:43:23,956 --> 01:43:24,882
Doctor?

1486
01:43:25,075 --> 01:43:27,441
He'll live. He's getting
the best care we have.

1487
01:43:27,636 --> 01:43:28,717
-Thank you.
-Certainly.

1488
01:43:29,812 --> 01:43:31,405
All right, okay.

1489
01:43:31,795 --> 01:43:33,388
Now, let's disperse this mob!

1490
01:44:24,081 --> 01:44:26,863
That's too much power
for one man to have.

1491
01:44:27,057 --> 01:44:29,990
Brother Minister, l'm ready
to take some heads.

1492
01:44:30,191 --> 01:44:32,332
We gotta do something
to put fear in those devils.

1493
01:44:32,529 --> 01:44:36,620
l'm ready to do something also. The
word out of Chicago was to be patient.

1494
01:44:36,816 --> 01:44:39,566
-l'm tired of being patient.
-Then you get on the phone--

1495
01:44:40,337 --> 01:44:43,468
You get on the phone, call Chicago
and let Mr. Muhammad know.

1496
01:45:00,015 --> 01:45:01,422
Have a seat, son.

1497
01:45:04,912 --> 01:45:07,083
The only thing l like integrated...

1498
01:45:08,527 --> 01:45:09,323
...is my coffee.

1499
01:45:11,406 --> 01:45:12,870
What can l do for you?

1500
01:45:16,078 --> 01:45:17,639
Well, Mr. X...

1501
01:45:18,959 --> 01:45:20,518
...my name is Benjamin.

1502
01:45:21,069 --> 01:45:22,978
l was out there tonight.

1503
01:45:23,471 --> 01:45:24,846
Take it easy now.

1504
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:27,565
And l saw what it is that you did.

1505
01:45:27,758 --> 01:45:30,408
The way you talked
to them policeman and all.

1506
01:45:34,606 --> 01:45:36,034
Well, Mr. X...

1507
01:45:38,542 --> 01:45:40,331
...l want to be a Muslim.

1508
01:45:40,686 --> 01:45:43,303
l ain't never seen a nigger--
l mean...

1509
01:45:43,565 --> 01:45:44,843
...colored person--

1510
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:47,716
Negro...

1511
01:45:48,685 --> 01:45:50,889
...talk to no police like that before.

1512
01:45:51,085 --> 01:45:53,899
And you want to be Muslim?
Join the Nation Of lslam?

1513
01:45:54,093 --> 01:45:56,875
You know what that means?
To be a Muslim?

1514
01:45:58,894 --> 01:45:59,973
Do you?

1515
01:46:03,403 --> 01:46:06,251
No, not exactly.
But l wanna be one.

1516
01:46:06,605 --> 01:46:07,620
Just like you.

1517
01:46:07,821 --> 01:46:11,617
You shouldn't join any organization
unless you know what it's about.

1518
01:46:18,028 --> 01:46:19,272
Thank you.

1519
01:46:20,876 --> 01:46:23,113
You shouldn't give up
so easily either.

1520
01:46:25,068 --> 01:46:28,200
We could use more young warriors
like yourself.

1521
01:46:28,427 --> 01:46:30,761
Come on by the temple
next Wednesday, 8:00.

1522
01:46:30,987 --> 01:46:32,133
8:00 sharp.

1523
01:46:32,331 --> 01:46:34,086
Yes, sir. 8:00 sharp.

1524
01:46:34,283 --> 01:46:37,447
Thank you, Mr. X. And l won't
make you out a liar either.

1525
01:46:37,644 --> 01:46:38,822
l don't think you will.

1526
01:46:51,467 --> 01:46:52,841
Tonight, l shall...

1527
01:46:53,321 --> 01:46:57,119
...introduce you
as my national minister.

1528
01:46:58,314 --> 01:47:00,681
lt will be a difficult task.

1529
01:47:01,066 --> 01:47:02,592
Your assignment...

1530
01:47:03,402 --> 01:47:05,955
...is to build temples
all over this nation.

1531
01:47:07,016 --> 01:47:09,025
More work than you've ever done.

1532
01:47:09,227 --> 01:47:10,241
Yes, sir.

1533
01:47:10,443 --> 01:47:12,384
You will be in the public eye.

1534
01:47:12,586 --> 01:47:15,105
Beware of them cameras.

1535
01:47:17,385 --> 01:47:18,662
Them cameras are...

1536
01:47:19,402 --> 01:47:21,539
...bad as any narcotic.

1537
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:26,946
White devil will be watching
your every step.

1538
01:47:27,561 --> 01:47:29,928
And your own brothers will be...

1539
01:47:30,984 --> 01:47:32,358
...jealous...

1540
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,658
...hostile.

1541
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:36,803
Go slowly.

1542
01:47:37,096 --> 01:47:38,176
Yes, sir.

1543
01:47:39,465 --> 01:47:40,839
Here's a glass.

1544
01:47:47,367 --> 01:47:49,256
lt's dirty water.

1545
01:47:49,449 --> 01:47:50,496
Foul.

1546
01:47:52,232 --> 01:47:54,566
lf you offer this to the people...

1547
01:47:54,759 --> 01:47:56,515
...they have no choice.

1548
01:47:56,935 --> 01:47:58,341
They'll drink from it...

1549
01:47:59,270 --> 01:48:00,765
...if they're thirsty.

1550
01:48:01,672 --> 01:48:03,427
But if you offer them...

1551
01:48:04,199 --> 01:48:05,824
...this glass...

1552
01:48:08,518 --> 01:48:11,617
...and let them make
their own decision...

1553
01:48:12,423 --> 01:48:15,554
...they will choose the pure vessel.

1554
01:48:17,478 --> 01:48:18,886
lslam is...

1555
01:48:19,302 --> 01:48:21,474
...the only religion...

1556
01:48:22,599 --> 01:48:25,598
...that addresses
the needs and the problems...

1557
01:48:25,797 --> 01:48:29,856
...of the so-called Negro in America.
Especially in the slums...

1558
01:48:30,054 --> 01:48:31,397
...in the ghettos.

1559
01:48:32,070 --> 01:48:35,998
lslam is the only way out
for drugs and crime...

1560
01:48:36,197 --> 01:48:38,302
...and unemployment, prostitution...

1561
01:48:38,502 --> 01:48:40,061
...alcohol...

1562
01:48:40,262 --> 01:48:41,603
...gambling...

1563
01:48:41,797 --> 01:48:43,969
...and adultery, fornication.

1564
01:48:45,221 --> 01:48:46,269
This sweet...

1565
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:50,657
...gentle man, at whose feet I kneeled,
gave me the truth from his own mouth.

1566
01:48:50,917 --> 01:48:52,062
Present the pure vessel.

1567
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:56,416
I adored him in the sense of
the Latin root of the word adorare...

1568
01:48:56,613 --> 01:48:58,586
...which means to worship and to fear.

1569
01:48:59,108 --> 01:49:00,864
He was the first man I ever feared.

1570
01:49:01,060 --> 01:49:03,581
I don't mean fear
such as one has of a gun...

1571
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:07,424
...but the fear one has
of the power of the sun.

1572
01:49:07,715 --> 01:49:10,879
I pledged myself to him,
even if it cost me my life.

1573
01:49:14,213 --> 01:49:15,903
-Hello?
-Hello, Betty?

1574
01:49:16,196 --> 01:49:17,373
Yeah, this is Malcolm.

1575
01:49:17,765 --> 01:49:20,317
-l know.
-Right, I'm here in Detroit.

1576
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:26,299
-Will you marry me?
-Yes.

1577
01:49:26,692 --> 01:49:28,066
You heard what I said, right?

1578
01:49:28,260 --> 01:49:30,561
-Did you hear my answer?
-Yes, l think so.

1579
01:49:32,994 --> 01:49:35,548
-Are you eating?
-l've been eating.

1580
01:49:35,779 --> 01:49:36,793
Good.

1581
01:49:37,508 --> 01:49:38,816
I love you, Betty.

1582
01:49:41,313 --> 01:49:43,223
I love you back.

1583
01:49:53,090 --> 01:49:54,431
lt's not gonna be easy.

1584
01:49:54,627 --> 01:49:56,088
No choice.

1585
01:49:56,577 --> 01:49:58,104
l'll be away a lot.

1586
01:49:58,913 --> 01:50:00,124
l know.

1587
01:50:02,817 --> 01:50:04,706
ln fact, l'm leaving in the morning.

1588
01:50:04,899 --> 01:50:06,328
Hush, now.

1589
01:50:07,138 --> 01:50:09,210
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia...

1590
01:50:10,818 --> 01:50:14,428
...Trenton, Newark, up through number 7
all the way up to Boston.

1591
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:22,554
You're with me...

1592
01:50:23,808 --> 01:50:25,697
...even when you're away.

1593
01:50:41,537 --> 01:50:43,772
l've never told you this...

1594
01:50:46,273 --> 01:50:48,989
...but the very first time
l ever saw you...

1595
01:50:50,016 --> 01:50:52,022
...standing up on the podium...

1596
01:50:54,526 --> 01:50:56,667
...you were cleaning your glasses...

1597
01:50:59,232 --> 01:51:01,848
...and l felt so sorry for you.

1598
01:51:02,751 --> 01:51:04,027
Sorry for me?

1599
01:51:04,479 --> 01:51:05,306
Why?

1600
01:51:05,503 --> 01:51:09,944
Because no one as young as you
should be so serious.

1601
01:51:12,799 --> 01:51:14,741
But l don't think that anymore.

1602
01:51:15,359 --> 01:51:16,667
What do you think?

1603
01:51:19,551 --> 01:51:22,333
l want to have
a lot of babies with you.

1604
01:51:25,950 --> 01:51:27,377
Dear heart.

1605
01:51:29,854 --> 01:51:31,228
l love you.

1606
01:51:33,375 --> 01:51:36,156
We're waiting on you folks.
Trying to starve us?

1607
01:51:39,454 --> 01:51:41,493
Brother Malcolm, Sister Betty...

1608
01:51:41,693 --> 01:51:46,035
...we pray that Allah blesses you
with a happy and fruitful marriage.

1609
01:51:48,925 --> 01:51:51,162
Congratulations, Brother Minister.

1610
01:51:53,373 --> 01:51:55,544
Check them out. Front page!

1611
01:51:59,868 --> 01:52:04,538
l must emphasize at the start that
Elijah Muhammad is not a politician.

1612
01:52:05,149 --> 01:52:09,786
So l'm not here this afternoon
as a Republican nor as a Democrat.

1613
01:52:11,293 --> 01:52:13,845
Not as a Mason nor as an Elk.

1614
01:52:15,132 --> 01:52:17,749
Not as a Protestant nor a Catholic.

1615
01:52:17,947 --> 01:52:20,533
Not as a Christian nor a Jew.

1616
01:52:20,731 --> 01:52:22,968
Not as a Baptist nor a Methodist.

1617
01:52:23,164 --> 01:52:25,464
ln fact, not even as an American.

1618
01:52:26,171 --> 01:52:28,178
Because if l was an American...

1619
01:52:28,410 --> 01:52:31,891
...the problem that confronts our people
today wouldn't even exist.

1620
01:52:35,163 --> 01:52:38,458
So l have to stand here today
as what l was when l was born...

1621
01:52:38,747 --> 01:52:40,241
...a black man.

1622
01:52:44,666 --> 01:52:49,172
Before there was any such thing as a
Republican or a Democrat, we were black.

1623
01:52:49,370 --> 01:52:53,015
Before there was any such thing
as a Mason or an Elk, we were black.

1624
01:52:53,210 --> 01:52:57,269
Before there was any such thing as a Jew
or a Christian, we were black people.

1625
01:52:57,466 --> 01:53:01,656
ln fact, before there was any such place
as America, we were black.

1626
01:53:01,914 --> 01:53:05,263
And after America has long passed
from the scene...

1627
01:53:05,465 --> 01:53:07,832
...there will still be black people.

1628
01:53:08,824 --> 01:53:11,377
l'm gonna tell you like it really is!

1629
01:53:12,090 --> 01:53:16,694
Every election year, these politicians
are sent up here to pacify us.

1630
01:53:16,890 --> 01:53:19,572
They're sent here and set up here
by the white man.

1631
01:53:19,768 --> 01:53:21,013
This is what they do.

1632
01:53:21,209 --> 01:53:23,990
They send drugs in Harlem down here
to pacify us!

1633
01:53:24,185 --> 01:53:26,770
They send alcohol down here
to pacify us!

1634
01:53:26,969 --> 01:53:29,816
They send prostitution down here
to pacify us!

1635
01:53:30,009 --> 01:53:33,271
You can't get drugs in Harlem
without the white man's permission.

1636
01:53:33,464 --> 01:53:36,628
You can't get prostitution in Harlem
without the white man's permission.

1637
01:53:36,825 --> 01:53:39,857
You can't get gambling in Harlem
without the white man's permission.

1638
01:53:40,056 --> 01:53:42,772
Every time you break the seal
on that liquor bottle...

1639
01:53:42,967 --> 01:53:45,424
...that's a government seal
you're breaking.

1640
01:53:45,623 --> 01:53:49,333
l say, and l say it again,
you been had.

1641
01:53:49,527 --> 01:53:50,989
You been took.

1642
01:53:51,192 --> 01:53:52,718
You been hoodwinked.

1643
01:53:53,046 --> 01:53:55,535
Bamboozled. Led astray.

1644
01:53:55,768 --> 01:53:58,156
Run amuck. This is what he does.

1645
01:53:58,423 --> 01:54:01,008
You know, some people
call this hate-teaching.

1646
01:54:01,334 --> 01:54:03,221
This isn't hate-teaching.

1647
01:54:03,414 --> 01:54:04,975
This is love-teaching.

1648
01:54:05,559 --> 01:54:07,979
l wouldn't tell you this
if l didn't love you.

1649
01:54:08,183 --> 01:54:10,865
l wouldn't stick my neck out for you
if l didn't love you.
