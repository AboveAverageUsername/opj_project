All around the world, lies.
My followers silenced.

They think we are
helpless here.

Far from Europe,
in Mexico, under protection.

96
00:16:57,128 --> 00:16:59,959
Stalin is furios,
why still they chase us?

97
00:17:00,864 --> 00:17:02,592
They know we are right.

98
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:06,695

This operation may not

120
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,739
It doesn't matter.

121
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:02,906
Some objective will have been achieved,
some fronts like painting.

Workers, citizens were
organize in this country ...

They have shown their
hostility to Trotksy.

124
00:23:11,386 --> 00:23:15,185
That will still be
a serious buisness.

125
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:38,126
You do not talk.

126
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:45,101

00:32:28,504 --> 00:32:30,902
By the way you achieved a certain sympathy.

182
00:32:31,872 --> 00:32:33,863
And how do i achieve my own death?

183
00:32:34,073 --> 00:32:36,304
What aim could i possibly can achieved,
I venturing ...

184
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:39,501
in an act so dangerous?
Why? what for?

185
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,871
I would have risk my own fate,
the fate of my family ...

186
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,603
my political reputation.

187
00:32:43,814 --> 00:32:45,941
The reputation of people
whom I serve.

188
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:48,178
What did I  stand to gain?

189
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,816
Luck was on the side of justice.
The intruders were incompetent.

190
00:32:56,322 --> 00:32:59,154
Then why didn't one of your guards
not fire back?

191
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,818
They are Americans.

192
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:05,221
Perhaps, they have too much respect for
police uniforms.

193
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:08,264
You trust them?
completly.

194
00:33:08,732 --> 00:33:11,426
In my profession,
you learn to trust, Colonel.

195
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,666
-I love that boy.
-He may be dead.

196
00:33:16,436 --> 00:33:18,665
He w'not cover up.
Anything else but this.

197
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,634
There are murders in the city,
saboteurs.

198
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,397
You know them.
Arrest them.

199
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,970
You have a theory
who was responsible?

200
00:33:29,212 --> 00:33:30,611
I must Certainly do.

201
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,510
Joseph Stalin.

202
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:47,852
Come on.

203
00:33:51,194 --> 00:33:57,062
Of the 12 apostles, only Judas
was a traitor, but ...

204
00:33:57,398 --> 00:33:59,628
if he had
a quiet power ...

205
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:02,829
He already left,
would have been the traitor.

206
00:34:12,142 --> 00:34:14,268
How I love you, Natasha.

207
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,609
My only one, faithfull, one my eternal ...

208
00:34:18,813 --> 00:34:21,781
One my love, my victum.

209
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:25,883
You always carrying me
on your shoulders ...

210
00:34:28,185 --> 00:34:30,881
as you carrying me
throughout our lives.

211
00:34:41,863 --> 00:34:43,762
You can be alone now.

212
00:34:46,732 --> 00:34:49,165
Most of our
friends will be arrested.

213
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:54,465
But I will not arrest you,
you are a businessman.

214
00:34:55,238 --> 00:34:57,967
-You will survive.
-Where will you be?

215
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:02,742
-I have had my falure.
-It was not yours.

216
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:08,106
It might have been a success,
such a dialectical.

217
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:11,949
Now a days there is a popular feeling
against Trotsky.

218
00:35:12,149 --> 00:35:14,982
Not just one madman
with a gun.

219
00:35:18,887 --> 00:35:20,320
-What will happen?
When?

220
00:35:20,522 --> 00:35:21,921
To you?

221
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,719
I'm not important.
I be looked after.

222
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:29,552
And if the next attemp
is a success ...

223
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:33,195
It even be looked after
very well.

224
00:35:44,205 --> 00:35:46,638
It is a peculiar situation.

225
00:35:47,474 --> 00:35:51,704
If the Soviet Union goes,
everything goes.

226
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:54,668
Be overturned.

227
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:58,775
Stalin is realistic.

228
00:35:59,049 --> 00:36:02,541
If the Soviet Union win
Stalin has to the real issue.

229
00:36:03,685 --> 00:36:07,018
This can only be done by some sacrifice
of all principles.

230
00:36:09,355 --> 00:36:11,289
Trotsky is an idealist.

231
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:13,925
He dreams of the perfect International
Workers State.

232
00:36:14,127 --> 00:36:15,354
We all do

233
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:17,856
But we are up again gangisters , armies!

234
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:21,655
Trotksy says he wants
the Soviet Union defended.

235
00:36:21,864 --> 00:36:23,922
But wants he would bring down
Stalin's government

236
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:26,157
in the name of
Marxist principles!

237
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:31,166
This would mean civil war.
That would defeat us.

238
00:36:31,805 --> 00:36:33,271
Look at your Spanish!
yes

239
00:36:33,472 --> 00:36:37,272
It was not the fascist
who owns us, but the Trotskyists!

240
00:36:37,942 --> 00:36:39,876
And now, with the fascists
over the Europe ...

241
00:36:40,077 --> 00:36:41,476
It might happen again.

242
00:36:42,545 --> 00:36:46,446
-I know of this.
"But you do not know is Trotsky.

243
00:36:48,215 --> 00:36:50,842
Trotksy is still has
certain power ...

244
00:36:51,117 --> 00:36:54,210
even he is alone, persuades
people all over the world.

245
00:36:54,521 --> 00:36:55,852
Look at his guards:

246
00:36:56,055 --> 00:36:58,683
They might have been college boys
Sweden, Germany.

247
00:36:58,891 --> 00:37:01,084
It will not persuade me.

248
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:03,892
Not like the police, the press.

249
00:37:04,828 --> 00:37:07,192
Trotksy was once the most popular man
in Russia.

250
00:37:08,296 --> 00:37:10,230
He is equal to Lenin.

251
00:37:11,365 --> 00:37:13,093
But forget it now.

252
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:18,401
But you don't have to do it.

253
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,335
Its your choice.

254
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,434
Well  Anyway,
we should have a federal think.

255
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:29,873
He is not the only one.
I also know persuade.

256
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:31,974
And I will not be alone.

257
00:37:33,548 --> 00:37:36,277
There are some things to handle.
For these hands.

258
00:37:36,582 --> 00:37:38,607
Go through here.

259
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,910
And I'm not important.

260
00:37:51,826 --> 00:37:55,193
now shot?
you could just sitdown?

261
00:37:56,262 --> 00:37:58,493
You are using my
try.

262
00:37:58,697 --> 00:38:00,722
For God sake, you men!
You men!

263
00:38:00,933 --> 00:38:02,696
I do not understand.

264
00:38:04,335 --> 00:38:06,768
And they all seem to be playing.

265
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:12,136
I think there is something going on
, somewhere ...

266
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:15,535
Behing my back,
and no one will tells me about.

267
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,003
What is it?

268
00:38:21,214 --> 00:38:23,545
You don't seems to be  interested
in living.

269
00:41:41,851 --> 00:41:45,116
Why does man not
closer to the horns?

270
00:41:45,355 --> 00:41:48,084
-He 's scared?
-He doesn't get scared.

271
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:49,980
He does.

272
00:41:50,357 --> 00:41:52,189
They do not leave the
oxes being killed ...

273
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:54,953
they take them out, treat them
and put them back again.

274
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,910
Why only bind
for the oxes?

275
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,614
What do you like it?
Blood?

276
00:42:33,854 --> 00:42:35,516
-Shut up.
What?

277
00:43:16,018 --> 00:43:17,449
-I have never seen people ...
"Go away!

278
00:43:17,651 --> 00:43:18,777
What?

279
00:43:18,986 --> 00:43:21,146
Its stupid, if you want to see
bullfighting, look!

280
00:43:21,354 --> 00:43:24,948
You have never seen people
having so much fun!

281
00:44:57,553 --> 00:44:58,815
Jacques!

282
00:45:08,328 --> 00:45:10,296
damn to your oxes!

283
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:19,897
Why not learn
about things? The reality?

284
00:45:20,336 --> 00:45:23,100
You think fighting since
committees, reviews ...

285
00:45:23,372 --> 00:45:27,135
and let the world rot,
for your own sport.

286
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:32,206
I will not,I will not
I be different.

287
00:45:32,711 --> 00:45:34,804
Jacques!
-I am not Jacques!

288
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,013
I know.
-you know nothing!

289
00:45:42,384 --> 00:45:46,286
This can not be decided now.
Seventeen years after the event ...

290
00:45:46,488 --> 00:45:51,718
Whether or not the deaths in Kromstadt,
which will my responsibility ...

291
00:45:52,724 --> 00:45:54,919
be justified
by history or not.

292
00:45:55,126 --> 00:45:57,252
I been was fotological.
correct or not."

293
00:45:58,594 --> 00:46:02,428
The civil war is not a
school for human behavior.

294
00:46:03,265 --> 00:46:07,429
Idealists and pacifists always
blame revolution for excesses.

295
00:46:07,702 --> 00:46:10,295
But the excesses bring from
nature of the revolution ...

296
00:46:10,503 --> 00:46:13,870
Which is, in itself,
an excess history.

297
00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:18,436
Those who wish to do so they
reject the revolution.

298
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:20,940
I do not reject.

299
00:46:21,944 --> 00:46:23,776
-They haven't found?
-No.

300
00:46:27,815 --> 00:46:30,215
And how is your family, Sheldon?

301
00:46:34,921 --> 00:46:38,755
This is not the time, for my friends
and idealists who have left ...

302
00:46:38,956 --> 00:46:41,925
to exsumed double their
amount of moral if you could heard

303
00:46:42,126 --> 00:46:44,287
the same way
a man, feare ...

304
00:46:44,495 --> 00:46:48,190
present double the amount of its
normal perspiration.

305
00:46:50,431 --> 00:46:52,990
I do not let him trust you,
Sheldon.

306
00:46:54,701 --> 00:46:55,963
Sheldon ...

307
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:02,898
Otto, I mean, Otto.

308
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:08,333
I trust that I will earn
my place in history ...

309
00:47:08,611 --> 00:47:12,307
Beside Lincoln, the
American Civil War.

310
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:15,403
History has
different measures.

311
00:47:16,349 --> 00:47:19,283
The slave owner used
his cunning and violence ...

312
00:47:19,484 --> 00:47:21,042
to chain the slaves ...

313
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:24,277
and the slaves used cunning and
violence to break chains.

314
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:28,947
Only contemptible eunuchs,
would say they are equal

315
00:47:29,158 --> 00:47:31,250
before a court
morality.

316
00:47:32,694 --> 00:47:35,959
Only contemptible eunuchs
would say that they are equal.

317
00:47:36,164 --> 00:47:38,426
before a court
morality.

318
00:47:39,532 --> 00:47:42,727
-You can repeat the final?
- "History has different measures ...

319
00:47:42,933 --> 00:47:44,663
The slave used
cunning and violence ... "

320
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,234
Not after!

321
00:47:55,642 --> 00:47:57,371
"Okay?
-All right.

322
00:48:00,847 --> 00:48:04,179
And the slaves used cunning and
violence to break chains.

323
00:48:04,383 --> 00:48:07,943
Only contemptible eunuchs
would say that they are equal.

324
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,209
before a court
of morality.

325
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:13,343
"All means are acceptable,
to lead to the true libration

326
00:48:13,556 --> 00:48:15,386
of mankind. "
-Are mandatory.

327
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:19,282
"They are only acceptable if they lead
the unity of the worker. "

328
00:48:19,693 --> 00:48:21,319
Or help them fight
against oppression.

329
00:48:21,528 --> 00:48:24,052
Therefore, not all
means are acceptable.

330
00:48:24,296 --> 00:48:26,696
You still hav'nt found
the leader of the attack?

331
00:48:26,898 --> 00:48:29,867
Sealed doors, shutters
windows, new balconies.

332
00:48:30,067 --> 00:48:31,931
It will come as
easily next time.

333
00:48:32,135 --> 00:48:36,331
We live in a submarine.
With my faithful periscope: Natasha.

334
00:48:36,605 --> 00:48:39,368
No more money
my books in France, is not it?

335
00:48:39,707 --> 00:48:41,435
Oh, France.

336
00:48:42,275 --> 00:48:45,211
None of this, or what,
but understanding.

337
00:48:45,545 --> 00:48:47,535
"Of course, all with
purpose of order ...

338
00:48:47,745 --> 00:48:50,976
-Nazi conquest of Europe. "
-Before Hitler was defeated ...

339
00:48:51,182 --> 00:48:54,809
There are many in
Europe who will be viped out.

340
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,482
Great tragedies of our times
are working for us.

341
00:48:57,853 --> 00:49:00,117
We are all exiles now
Marguerita.

342
00:49:00,321 --> 00:49:03,517
I am very grateful for having
Sieve France taken in time.

343
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:07,419
-Sieva miss you.
-perhaps less than me.

344
00:49:07,693 --> 00:49:09,990
Let's drink a Sieve.
A future revolutionary.

345
00:49:10,195 --> 00:49:11,560
We hope..

346
00:49:15,631 --> 00:49:17,656
You know why Catarina,
the Great, died?

347
00:49:17,866 --> 00:49:19,960
In his laboratory.
Reading encyclopedias.

348
00:49:21,469 --> 00:49:23,460
I love it!

349
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:48,142
Sheldon?

350
00:52:49,045 --> 00:52:51,240
Anyway,
we all love you

351
00:52:52,515 --> 00:52:54,278
and not Trotksy.

352
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:09,822
He is an extraordinary man.
i think you have to see him.

353
00:53:10,194 --> 00:53:12,092
He may need you.

354
00:53:12,729 --> 00:53:15,287
Probably has a lot
people that flatters.

355
00:53:16,999 --> 00:53:18,660
If you want an excuse,
for going in

356
00:53:18,866 --> 00:53:20,857
can say is
visiting Rosmonds.

357
00:53:22,268 --> 00:53:23,632
They will leaving soon?
yes

358
00:53:25,237 --> 00:53:27,364
-How are they going?
-By Vera Cruz.

359
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:33,504
Well, I can go to Vera Cruz.
I could take them.

360
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,440
Would you?

361
00:53:36,478 --> 00:53:39,311
But I thought you did not want to meet
Trotsky .

362
00:53:39,547 --> 00:53:42,036
-I am not frieghten.
what you have been?

363
00:53:44,384 --> 00:53:46,545
I want to ...

364
00:53:48,954 --> 00:53:50,319
What?

365
00:54:04,096 --> 00:54:06,530
For the same reason that it felt to
my loss ...

366
00:54:06,732 --> 00:54:08,631
to take part in
great events.

367
00:54:08,833 --> 00:54:11,802
my past now cuffs
me off from chances of action.

368
00:54:12,302 --> 00:54:17,604
I am reduced to interpreting events
and trying to foresee their future course.

369
00:54:22,576 --> 00:54:23,873
Lev?

370
00:54:26,247 --> 00:54:28,679
Where's the food?
"I've had our food.

371
00:54:28,881 --> 00:54:31,441
The food for the rabbits.

372
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:33,240
-What day is today?
-Sunday.

373
00:54:33,451 --> 00:54:36,078
Sunday? in mexico.

374
00:54:39,321 --> 00:54:42,289
We've all fattened
for the table.

375
00:54:44,259 --> 00:54:47,819
It's so hot here.
It's like being drowned.

376
00:54:52,864 --> 00:54:54,092
Fools!

377
00:54:55,267 --> 00:54:56,756
Monkeys!

378
00:54:59,736 --> 00:55:02,225

379
00:56:06,415 --> 00:56:08,041
Want to come in?

380
00:56:12,253 --> 00:56:13,981
Why not?

381
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:26,556
I take it over from you.

382
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:31,691
Take a snap through there.
Will be nice.

383

you have  builting some building.

384
00:56:47,911 --> 00:56:49,276
Sure.

385
00:56:49,712 --> 00:56:51,179
That's good.

386
00:56:55,483 --> 00:56:57,745
like these?
-What are they?

387
00:56:57,916 --> 00:57:01,352
- "Lucky Strike."
No, I prefer these Mexicans.

388
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,145
Thank you.

389
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:11,484
-What do you do?
-Import and export.

390
00:57:11,994 --> 00:57:13,655
What, for God sake?

391
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,997
I need the faces
of the poor.you Know?

392
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,427
I be a nice communist
who will mixes up with you?

393
00:57:28,505 --> 00:57:31,201
Well, there is one thing for sure,
you are not trying to get in.

394
00:57:31,507 --> 00:57:34,304
You are about the only person in this
demn town that is'nt.

395
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:39,801
But I admire him, you know?
might be able to help.

396
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,178
Put him in touch
with one or two ...

397
00:57:45,184 --> 00:57:47,743
This must have cost
quiet a lot.

398
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:52,049
In war times.
You know, I could be useful.

399
00:57:59,293 --> 00:58:02,557
No politics.
too much talking politics.

400
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:04,393
Like a woman.

401
00:58:05,497 --> 00:58:07,397
The old man like that.

402
00:58:08,532 --> 00:58:10,262
I'll tell him.

403
00:58:10,769 --> 00:58:12,235
Yeah you tell him.

404
00:58:14,204 --> 00:58:17,640
Who was there to say that Trotsky
was hated only by Stalin?

405
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,670
Trotksy was hated
millions ...

406
00:58:20,207 --> 00:58:22,801
of all nationalities,
all over the world.

407
00:58:23,177 --> 00:58:25,666
We convinced of his
traitor's role.

408
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:34,612
Trotksy: encounter-revolutionary.
and Enemy of the working class.

409
00:58:37,586 --> 00:58:43,546
If he have to die, or
be killed, I would personaly be pleased.

410
00:58:44,391 --> 00:58:46,723
This does not mean
I would kill him...

411
00:58:46,926 --> 00:58:48,950
or cause him to be killed.

412
00:58:51,462 --> 00:58:55,261
The Mexican Communist Party does not
gives orders for person to be killed.

413
00:58:57,333 --> 00:59:01,825
Trotksy is a political ,
not a personal enemy.

414
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:07,263
We shall open enemy doctrine .
acts of personnel terrorism .

415
00:59:10,977 --> 00:59:16,378
However, if the evidence
that you have,before is true ...

416
00:59:17,981 --> 00:59:21,813
If indeed I did helped in preparation for
the Trotksy revenge...

417
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:27,952
then you have every right
to make the logical assumption ...

418
00:59:29,288 --> 00:59:32,985
I might been involved,in
the assassination attempt.

419
00:59:53,138 --> 00:59:54,799
Okay, take a hold up now, Jim.

420
00:59:57,275 --> 00:59:59,798
To be uninitiated it may
seem incomprehensible ...

421
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:02,534
that Stalin plea to the first
exile me...

422
01:00:02,745 --> 01:00:04,906
and then should attemt to kill me,
abroad.

423
01:00:05,114 --> 01:00:07,172
Tighten.
Tighten a little more

424
01:00:11,084 --> 01:00:12,914
It may seem incomprehensible  ...

425
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,052
that Stalin plea to the first
exile me...

426
01:00:15,253 --> 01:00:17,118
and then should attemt to kill me,
abroad.

427
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,413
I got it, Ed

428
01:00:18,622 --> 01:00:20,646
would have been simpler,
give me a shot in Moscow ...

429
01:00:20,857 --> 01:00:21,846
like so many others.

430
01:00:22,058 --> 01:00:25,321
I'm Peter, a friend and
companion of Trotksy.

431
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:28,419
I am informed that Stalin sevral
times admitted ...

432
01:00:28,629 --> 01:00:30,756
that my exile role was a  ...

433
01:00:31,799 --> 01:00:33,266
It is a tombstone.

434
01:00:36,636 --> 01:00:39,330
Jim, a man
come with a plate.

435
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:43,163
Have you checked the plate?
no i havn't checked any damn plate.

436
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,569
Who the hell are you?

437
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:48,667
He says he is Peter, come
fix a plate.

438
01:00:48,909 --> 01:00:51,537
Jim, my  security chief in
New York. he is new.

439
01:00:53,313 --> 01:00:55,281
He says he is a friend of Valdez.

440
01:00:56,081 --> 01:00:58,140
I am Sam, the miniapalos Union.

441
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:00,011
"joined the rmy,
see the world. "

442
01:01:00,217 --> 01:01:01,616
Who said you
could come in here any way?

443
01:01:01,819 --> 01:01:03,582
He does not may like,to seeing
any body today.

444
01:01:03,788 --> 01:01:05,187
Workman he is a friend..

445
01:01:05,389 --> 01:01:06,480
What that?

446
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:09,283
The old man does not stop him
to see him.

447
01:01:09,491 --> 01:01:12,117
All are welcome.
What else does he got?

448
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:19,995
IN MEMORY OF ROBERT SHELDON
MURDERED BY STALIN

449
01:01:20,298 --> 01:01:21,788
Come!

450
01:01:24,134 --> 01:01:28,536
The repetition of the attack
is inevitable. In what form?

451
01:01:29,739 --> 01:01:32,571
Possibly once again, in the form
a pure terrorist attack ...

452
01:01:32,774 --> 01:01:35,206
wher along with machine guns or bombs.

453
01:01:35,509 --> 01:01:37,601
Look good.
Still alive.

454
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:42,436
By the permission of Stalin.

455
01:01:43,614 --> 01:01:46,877
It is the desire of some.
I can understand that.

456
01:01:47,084 --> 01:01:49,551
Health, vitality, strength, life.

457
01:01:50,419 --> 01:01:53,409
I am death wish of your
modern religions.

458
01:01:55,222 --> 01:01:56,553

01:02:08,431 --> 01:02:11,331
-Stop it.
doing my job.

464
01:02:12,134 --> 01:02:14,432
See the animals understand.
They have premonitions.

465
01:02:15,303 --> 01:02:17,498
I do'nt like you
talking like that.

466
01:02:17,838 --> 01:02:19,703
Why? because I said
I was lucky?

467
01:02:22,874 --> 01:02:27,037
Art is one of the ways which
man finds his support in the world.

468
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,441
No one has much chance
enter here ...

469
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:37,584
what is this noise.

470
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,611
-How are you?
-Welcome.

471
01:02:39,819 --> 01:02:42,287
This alarm is very loud.

472
01:02:47,892 --> 01:02:49,756
I have a little button
in my room now.

473
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,019
If i press it, I summons
legions of helpers.

474
01:02:52,229 --> 01:02:54,128
I was so sad,
with what happened.

475
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:55,797
How wonderful!

476
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:59,329
You are wonderful.
Looks like a battleship!

477
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,065
Now no one can get in.
no one.

478
01:03:02,669 --> 01:03:04,135
I can't believe
you're going.

479
01:03:04,337 --> 01:03:06,464
All good things
start to an end.

480
01:03:06,906 --> 01:03:09,873
Well,we'll see you in Berlin
Alfredo.

481
01:03:10,074 --> 01:03:11,837
In the Nazi-Soviet State?

482
01:03:12,109 --> 01:03:13,369
Not you coming?

483
01:03:13,943 --> 01:03:16,274
-Just for a day?
-A counter-revolutionary?

484
01:03:16,478 --> 01:03:18,378
I hear our friends
are outraged ...

485
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:21,275
About the Nazi-Soviet pact.
I think he come to kidnap me.

486
01:03:21,481 --> 01:03:23,039
I think is understandable?

487
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:27,345
And my dear friend,i find it childish to deny
the Soviet Union the Title of Workers State .

488
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:31,044
Hysteria and Marxism are
absolutely irreconcilable.

489
01:03:31,256 --> 01:03:33,155
They want to take revenge on Stalin.

490
01:03:33,357 --> 01:03:36,052
Trotsky one Trotskyism,
without Trotsky.

491
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:42,091
I'm Sorry, I must work,
I can not come with you.

492
01:03:42,295 --> 01:03:45,958
-Thank your friend for asking.
Are you sure he wants to take us?

493
01:03:46,399 --> 01:03:48,889
Will the Stock Exchange
manage without you?

494
01:03:49,101 --> 01:03:50,329
Yes

495
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,264
Why did'nt he come in?

496
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:55,898
-He is shy.
-Is shy? from us?

497
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,107
Jacques!
-You call him Jacques?

498
01:03:59,308 --> 01:04:01,936
He is Fred.
Fred Jacson. Jacques!

499
01:04:06,313 --> 01:04:08,371
Jacques, come here.

500
01:04:09,382 --> 01:04:11,042
He is shy.

501
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:17,315
He is been working to meet you .

502
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:19,651
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

503
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,183

504
01:04:43,406 --> 01:04:44,771

505
01:04:45,806 --> 01:04:48,331
-How many?
-Six.

506
01:04:53,613 --> 01:04:55,240
Do you like rabbits?

507
01:04:57,715 --> 01:05:00,878
He is a great breader.
he is favorite .

508
01:05:01,418 --> 01:05:04,215
Thank you for taking
Margaret and Albert.

509
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,077
I would'nt even
Vera Cruz,any way  sir.

510
01:05:06,287 --> 01:05:08,652
-You found your way here?
you're well-guarded.

511
01:05:08,856 --> 01:05:11,619
Its Sieva he takes up the attention most
of my guards.

512
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,793
-I heard about our little trouble?
-Yes.

513
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:16,321
They wouldn't try the same,
thing twice.

514
01:05:21,298 --> 01:05:23,926
Is a man-informed.
I think so.

515
01:05:24,168 --> 01:05:26,396
Guita told me you're not
interested in politics.

516
01:05:26,602 --> 01:05:28,536
I think the policy a rival.

517
01:05:28,737 --> 01:05:30,864
Gita, he says
politics have its rival.

518
01:05:31,073 --> 01:05:33,664
No, you are.
me.. Old men are dangerous.

519
01:05:33,874 --> 01:05:35,273
If they are old enough.

520
01:05:35,475 --> 01:05:37,101
"She does not agree with me.
-I agree with you.

521
01:05:37,309 --> 01:05:38,866
Come on.

Goodbye.

524
01:05:42,913 --> 01:05:44,539
- "Au-revoir."
-Goodbye.

525
01:05:46,414 --> 01:05:48,246
He won't talk about politics.

526
01:05:56,923 --> 01:05:58,720
Should be more careful,
Comrade Trotksy.

527
01:05:58,925 --> 01:06:00,448
Yes

528
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:14,257
can not, without disgust
and horror ...

529
01:06:14,501 --> 01:06:18,436
read the poems and novels,
or look at pictures and sculptures ...

530
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:22,471
in which officers, armed
pen, brush or chisel ...

531
01:06:23,075 --> 01:06:26,167
supervised by officers,
armed with revolvers ...

532
01:06:26,644 --> 01:06:29,543
glorify the great leaders
and genius.

533
01:06:59,899 --> 01:07:03,026
Officers armed
pen, brush or chisel ...

534
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:06,996
supervised by officers,
armed with guns ...

535
01:07:07,504 --> 01:07:10,267
glorify the great leaders
to e geniuses ...

536
01:07:10,539 --> 01:07:13,371
in which there is
the slightest ...

537
01:07:13,576 --> 01:07:15,975
of genius or scope.

538
01:07:17,045 --> 01:07:19,445
The art of the Age of Stalin
will remain ...

539
01:07:19,647 --> 01:07:23,103
the most strongest expression,
steep decline ...

540
01:07:23,883 --> 01:07:26,282
Of proletariat revolution .

541
01:07:42,929 --> 01:07:44,987
-What are you doing?
-Writing.

542
01:07:45,197 --> 01:07:46,994
-What?
-An article.

543
01:08:46,841 --> 01:08:49,706
43 years,
my conscious life ...

544
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:51,839
I have been a revolutionary.

545
01:08:52,411 --> 01:08:57,813
And for 42 of those years, i have fought under
the banner of Marxism.

546
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:04,977
If I were to begin again i would,
try to avoid this or that mistakes ...

547
01:09:05,852 --> 01:09:08,912
but the main course of my
life would remain the same.

548
01:09:10,256 --> 01:09:14,783
I should die a proletarian revolutionary
the  ...

549
01:09:16,328 --> 01:09:17,623
a Marxist ...

550
01:09:18,129 --> 01:09:20,187
a dialectical materialist ...

551
01:09:20,764 --> 01:09:24,164
and consequently
an irreconcilable atheist.

552
01:09:25,733 --> 01:09:29,293
The nature of my illness
is such, as I understand ...

553
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:34,035
that the end must come suddenly
probably through a brain hemorrhage.

554
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:40,306
If, however, I should be threatened
with a lasting disability  ...

555
01:09:41,512 --> 01:09:44,674
then, I reserve
the right to determine ...

556
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:47,446
for my self the time of my own death.

557
01:09:48,549 --> 01:09:51,779
This suicide
if such a term is appropriate ...

558
01:09:52,385 --> 01:09:55,411
Will not any sanse reflect
despair ...

559
01:09:55,854 --> 01:09:58,651
or helplessness
or holessness.

560
01:09:59,356 --> 01:10:01,347
Whatever the circumstances

561
01:10:02,125 --> 01:10:07,823
I should die utterly believing
in the communist future.

562
01:10:14,468 --> 01:10:17,436
Natasha just come from the window,
from the courtyard ...

563
01:10:18,737 --> 01:10:23,331
And opened it wider, so that the air may enter
more freely into my room.

564
01:10:25,108 --> 01:10:28,098
I can see a bright stripe of green,
under the wall ...

565
01:10:29,177 --> 01:10:31,168
and sunlight everywhere.

566
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:37,572
In addition to the happiness of being a
fighter for the cause socialism  ...

567
01:10:38,684 --> 01:10:42,949
fate has given me the happiness
to be the husband of Natasha.

568
01:10:44,955 --> 01:10:48,720
She has been
inexhaustible ...

569
01:10:50,592 --> 01:10:55,187
tenderness,
love and magnanimity.

570
01:10:57,329 --> 01:10:58,922
Life is beautiful ...

571
01:11:00,099 --> 01:11:03,431
That future generations
get rid of all ...

572
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:07,768
evil
violence and oppression ...

573
01:11:09,406 --> 01:11:10,997
and enjoy it...

574
01:11:12,674 --> 01:11:14,107
fully.

575
01:11:47,531 --> 01:11:50,863
Sorry. Lev Davidovich
sleeping.

576
01:11:54,836 --> 01:11:56,701
Will  you come in?

577
01:12:17,051 --> 01:12:19,541
Please take a seat.

578
01:12:22,822 --> 01:12:25,552
Would you like some coffee?
No, thank you.

579
01:12:26,324 --> 01:12:28,689
A glass of water.
-All right.

580
01:12:43,837 --> 01:12:46,134
I am sorry,
he spent the night awake.

581
01:12:46,338 --> 01:12:49,932
He worked so hhard.
I know he would like to see it.

582
01:12:53,644 --> 01:12:56,634
-Is he sick?
No, just tired.

583
01:13:05,019 --> 01:13:06,714
I have something to ask.

584
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:10,848
"I got an article.
-An article?

585
01:13:15,325 --> 01:13:19,522
Frank ... may i call you
Frank? have Heard so much about you.

586
01:13:21,529 --> 01:13:24,156
-Where do you come from?
-Belgium.

587
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:31,301
"But Jackson is an English name.
-Canadian.

588
01:13:32,171 --> 01:13:33,933
I needed a passport.

589
01:13:37,842 --> 01:13:38,899
Why?

590
01:13:39,108 --> 01:13:42,339
To get away from the war.
the Capitalist war.

591
01:13:47,114 --> 01:13:49,273
And where did you lived?

592
01:13:51,517 --> 01:13:52,745
Paris.

593
01:14:00,823 --> 01:14:02,848
Our son was in Paris.

594
01:14:03,159 --> 01:14:04,251
Lev ..

595
01:14:06,293 --> 01:14:07,521
You..

596
01:14:12,331 --> 01:14:14,697
He was about your age,

597
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:17,596
Did you know him?

598
01:14:18,235 --> 01:14:20,896
I didn't have much to do about politics

599
01:14:28,141 --> 01:14:30,439
What is your article about?

600
01:14:30,644 --> 01:14:33,669
France.
the present situation in France.

601
01:14:35,848 --> 01:14:38,280
Our son was murdered
in Paris.

602
01:14:47,222 --> 01:14:50,748
They took him to the hospital,
he was getting well, but ...

603
01:14:52,291 --> 01:14:54,156
just as he was better...

604
01:14:57,463 --> 01:15:02,263
I do not agree with Guita,
you see i think Davidovich wishes is right ...

605
01:15:03,568 --> 01:15:05,693
Soviet Union
should be defended.

606
01:15:06,402 --> 01:15:09,801
Me And Guita would had it
quite a querell.

607
01:15:11,539 --> 01:15:13,029
Oh these fighting...

608
01:15:45,495 --> 01:15:47,019
Felipe?

609
01:15:55,703 --> 01:15:58,171
There will be a car, and
the shipment is complete.

610
01:15:58,371 --> 01:15:59,838
You shouldn't have much trouble.

611
01:16:01,906 --> 01:16:03,669
But there mustn't be any noise.

612
01:16:04,108 --> 01:16:06,906
-What happened to Philip?
- perfectly well.

613
01:16:07,111 --> 01:16:08,577
As you will.

614
01:16:09,145 --> 01:16:11,773
Yo got the money?
-its is not the money.

615
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:13,847
Ah no off course.

616
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:20,378
It will be a hero.

617
01:17:01,314 --> 01:17:03,146
You been in a house?

618
01:17:10,321 --> 01:17:12,913
Yes.
I know, is difficult ,We all find that.

619
01:17:13,123 --> 01:17:14,749
Never mind.

620
01:17:17,859 --> 01:17:20,224
Its up to you, of course.

621
01:17:20,861 --> 01:17:22,692
You always say that.

622
01:17:23,664 --> 01:17:25,688
I saw your mother the other day.

623
01:17:28,666 --> 01:17:30,361
She was well.

624
01:17:45,645 --> 01:17:47,612
He says he is Belgian.
but

625
01:17:48,214 --> 01:17:51,273
he looks more like a
Spanian to me.

626
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:57,147
He said he made contributions to
party funds.

627
01:18:00,422 --> 01:18:03,822
You should not trust him.
I do feel you  have to ask him...

628
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:11,321
I brought some chocolates
for your wife.

629
01:18:12,163 --> 01:18:14,461
She said she likes
chocolate.

630
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:18,594
They are from Switzerland.
-How did you get in?

631
01:18:18,868 --> 01:18:23,133
-The guards are friendly.
-Natasha is not here today.

632
01:18:24,173 --> 01:18:26,298
You should not sit so much in the sun.

633
01:18:27,141 --> 01:18:30,735
I fainted my self the other day.
It's the altitude here.

634
01:18:33,145 --> 01:18:36,375
I ate some fish.
Fish does not do agree with me.

635
01:18:38,982 --> 01:18:42,075
-You got the article?
-It is a draft.

636
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:44,043
A rough draft.

637
01:19:31,118 --> 01:19:32,982
Why don't you take your coat off?

638
01:20:05,641 --> 01:20:08,269
Spends most
your time here.

639
01:20:22,286 --> 01:20:24,584
Looks like a monk's cell.

640
01:20:29,759 --> 01:20:31,727
You  should get out more.

641
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,627
In the mountains.

642
01:20:38,599 --> 01:20:40,531
I told you like mountains.

643
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:44,628
Too cold, young man.

644
01:20:46,003 --> 01:20:48,300
Need more

645
01:20:49,006 --> 01:20:50,268

646
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:58,607
What do you want?

647
01:21:01,448 --> 01:21:04,813
-Shall I go?
-Yes.

648
01:21:06,784 --> 01:21:08,375
Will I come back?

649
01:21:09,919 --> 01:21:11,511

01:22:09,193 --> 01:22:11,128
I saw your gun.

657
01:22:12,397 --> 01:22:14,023
That scared me.

658
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:20,632
You know ...

659
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:31,032

Are you sick?

662
01:23:00,696 --> 01:23:02,629
Maybe you should see to the doctor.

663
01:23:02,831 --> 01:23:04,354
I know a good one,
in New York.

664
01:23:04,565 --> 01:23:07,124
They can do things

665
01:23:11,471 --> 01:23:15,199

You know?

670
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:25,616
but you don't have to do it.

671
01:24:27,789 --> 01:24:29,450

01:26:05,757 --> 01:26:08,021
You never call me Guita.

688
01:26:13,029 --> 01:26:14,723
I just call you Guita.

689
01:26:52,990 --> 01:26:55,616

692
01:27:10,036 --> 01:27:12,696
Hey you need your haircut.

693
01:27:15,806 --> 01:27:18,329
Often, i wake in the
morning, so I think:

694
01:27:18,573 --> 01:27:20,438
"Why do we wake?"

695
01:27:22,176 --> 01:27:25,941
But then there is you.
My Natasha.

696
01:27:29,114 --> 01:27:31,844
The old work horse.

01:27:32,051 --> 01:27:34,314
Perhaps, we go out later.
To collect some cacti.

698
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,611

mountains.

699
01:27:38,955 --> 01:27:42,979
You are very patient with me natasha.
I'm an cross old man.

700
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:47,452
When we first came here
I use to think.

701
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:52,761
"What cruel trick,we had no home
of own home for such a long time. "

702
01:27:54,331 --> 01:27:57,767
But now I think we may have
built something here, Natasha.

703
01:27:57,968 --> 01:28:01,095
Not just walls.
But a place with some sanity.

704
01:28:01,304 --> 01:28:02,930
I know that its impossible.

705
01:28:03,138 --> 01:28:06,470
Away to get a message
out of this house and around the world ...

706
01:28:06,674 --> 01:28:08,937
In through,
the back door.

707
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:12,607
Who?

708
01:28:14,379 --> 01:28:16,642
Frank Jackson.

709
01:28:32,092 --> 01:28:35,026
Healed? Why do you
carry that coat?

710
01:28:37,528 --> 01:28:41,156
Be careful what you eat.
The food is dangerous.

711
01:28:42,399 --> 01:28:46,299
Fish and vegetables are all right,
as long as you wash them before you eat them.

712
01:28:47,901 --> 01:28:50,300
Its not at high altitude.

713
01:28:58,677 --> 01:29:00,871
They say that when
the old worshipers of the sun ..

714
01:29:01,079 --> 01:29:04,774
drew the hearts out of their still living
victims...

715
01:29:04,981 --> 01:29:08,210
It was the study the cardial effects
of high altitudes.

716
01:29:11,486 --> 01:29:14,420
Best joke.
Jewish joke.

717
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:16,554
Bronstein-Trotsky joke .

718
01:29:25,561 --> 01:29:28,325
The great thing about political writing
is clarity.

719
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:31,020
Do not try to say too many things
for the same time.

720
01:29:44,074 --> 01:29:45,541
They like simplicity ...

721
01:29:47,009 --> 01:29:49,068
analyzed separately.

722
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:56,413
Question of accuracy.

723
01:30:01,486 --> 01:30:03,113
Of will.

724
01:30:05,488 --> 01:30:07,115
Life is complex ...

725
01:30:08,091 --> 01:30:11,151
but in the end
is simple.

726
01:30:29,273 --> 01:30:31,137
Help!

727
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:35,907
Lev!

728
01:30:38,445 --> 01:30:41,469
Help!
Help!

729
01:30:42,948 --> 01:30:44,643
Help!

730
01:30:59,126 --> 01:31:01,492
Lev! Lev!

731
01:31:09,432 --> 01:31:10,899
Lev!

732
01:31:24,377 --> 01:31:25,935
He did.

733
01:31:26,246 --> 01:31:28,543
The saboteur.at last.

734
01:31:37,852 --> 01:31:39,648
I stopped him.

735
01:31:40,921 --> 01:31:43,253
Tell them not to kill him.
He must talk.

736
01:31:43,989 --> 01:31:45,855
Move!
hurry! hurry!

737
01:31:47,526 --> 01:31:48,550
Come!

738
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:53,729
She had nothing
to do with it!

739
01:32:02,869 --> 01:32:05,429
She had nothing with it.
They took my mother!

740
01:32:05,939 --> 01:32:08,872
-Quick, grab the guy!
-They took my mother!

741
01:32:10,141 --> 01:32:12,268
And no one stopped them!

742
01:32:15,845 --> 01:32:17,608
Mother!

743
01:32:18,114 --> 01:32:20,445
Mother! Mother!

744
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:12,649
Easy.

745
01:33:37,802 --> 01:33:40,099
There is nothing to say.

746
01:33:41,405 --> 01:33:44,032
Get them out of here.

747
01:34:03,853 --> 01:34:08,515
See the barbarians
also come.

748
01:34:23,033 --> 01:34:24,364
Natasha.

749
01:34:25,902 --> 01:34:28,234
Do not let them undress me.

750
01:34:31,339 --> 01:34:33,603
I want you to
undress me.

751
01:34:35,909 --> 01:34:36,876
Yes

752
01:35:16,038 --> 01:35:17,503
Lies.

753
01:35:19,072 --> 01:35:21,005
All lies.

754
01:36:01,101 --> 01:36:02,795
Who are you?

755
01:36:16,545 --> 01:36:18,638
Who gave the orders?

756
01:36:28,086 --> 01:36:30,315
What were your motives?

757
01:36:33,289 --> 01:36:35,757
What were your motives?

758
01:37:12,117 --> 01:37:13,812
-Kill him!
"Who gave the orders?

759
01:37:14,019 --> 01:37:15,747
-Kill him!
-What were your orders?

760
01:37:15,953 --> 01:37:17,250
Kill him!

761
01:37:17,455 --> 01:37:18,820

Kill him!

766

768
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:21,430
