{106}{178}-Hey, look who's here.|-Maestro!
{231}{341}You couldn't play something good, huh?|Like Hank Williams?
{351}{435}They broke the door down|before I could take requests.
{441}{535}-Was it worth two weeks?|-Easiest time I ever did.
{541}{667}-No such thing as easy time in the hole.|-A week in the hole is like a year.
{673}{772}-Damn straight.|-I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.
{778}{867}So they let you tote|that record player down there, huh?
{940}{981}It was in here.
{1006}{1043}In here.
{1077}{1140}That's the beauty of music. They...
{1146}{1216}...can't get that from you.
{1322}{1393}Haven't you ever felt|that way about music?
{1447}{1541}Well, I played a mean harmonica|as a younger man.
{1573}{1623}Lost interest in it, though.
{1629}{1677}Didn't make much sense in here.
{1687}{1747}Here's where it makes the most sense.
{1763}{1825}You need it so you don't forget.
{1842}{1878}Forget?
{1889}{1982}Forget that there are...
{1988}{2031}...places...
{2046}{2161}...in the world|that aren't made out of stone.
{2191}{2236}There's something...
{2246}{2288}...inside...
{2296}{2355}...that they can't get to...
{2361}{2402}...that they can't touch.
{2418}{2461}That's yours.
{2507}{2555}What are you talking about?
{2586}{2623}Hope.
{2655}{2695}Hope.
{2753}{2813}Let me tell you something, my friend.
{2837}{2906}Hope is a dangerous thing.
{2941}{3011}Hope can drive a man insane.
{3033}{3097}It's got no use on the inside.
{3103}{3169}You'd better get used to that idea.
{3244}{3289}Like Brooks did?

{4049}{4079}Sit down.
{4239}{4338}Says here that you've served|30 years of a life sentence.
{4374}{4435}You feel you've been rehabilitated?
{4441}{4478}Oh, yes, sir.
{4516}{4556}Without a doubt.
{4591}{4663}I can honestly say I'm a changed man.
{4723}{4781}No danger to society here.
{4797}{4843}God's honest truth.
{4920}{4983}Absolutely rehabilitated.
{5283}{5323}Thirty years.
{5382}{5439}Jesus, when you say it like that....
{5465}{5519}You wonder where it went.
{5592}{5657}I wonder where 1 0 years went.
{5806}{5837}Here.
{5850}{5932}A little parole rejection present.
{5970}{6021}Go ahead and open it.
{6054}{6114}Went through one of your competitors.
{6121}{6215}I hope you don't mind.|I wanted it to be a surprise.
{6516}{6560}It's very pretty.
{6612}{6648}Thank you.
{6725}{6769}You going to play it?
{6906}{6944}No.
{7052}{7094}Not right now.
{7624}{7657}Roll in!
{8742}{8779}Lights out!
{9816}{9880}Andy was as good as his word.
{9891}{9974}He wrote two letters a week|instead of one.
{10036}{10159}In 1959, the state senate|finally clued in to the fact...
{10166}{10260}...they couldn't buy him off|with just a $200 check.
{10266}{10395}Appropriations Committee|voted an annual payment of $500...
{10401}{10458}...just to shut him up.
{10464}{10554}And you'd be amazed how far|Andy could stretch it.
{10560}{10648}He made deals with book clubs,|charity groups.
{10654}{10737}He bought remaindered books|by the pound....
{10752}{10798}Treasure Island.
{10814}{10854}Robert Louis--
{10860}{10890}Stevenson.
{10897}{10938}Fiction, adventure.
{11015}{11045}What's next?
{11052}{11143}I got here Auto Repair...
{11166}{11201}...and Soap Carving.
{11207}{11304}Trade skills and hobbies.|Under "Educational," behind you.
{11310}{11366}Count of Monte Crisco.
{11380}{11449}That's "Cristo," you dumb shit.
{11482}{11511}By Alexandree...
{11526}{11564}...Dum-ass.
{11574}{11605}Dumb ass.
{11674}{11706}Dumb ass?
{11793}{11852}Dumas. Know what that's about?
{11920}{11979}You'd like it.|It's about a prison break.
{11985}{12102}We ought to file that|under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?
{12128}{12251}The rest of us did our best|to pitch in when and where we could.
{12268}{12321}By the year Kennedy was shot...
{12328}{12462}...Andy had transformed a storage room|smelling of turpentine...
{12472}{12565}...into the best prison library|in New England...
{12586}{12674}...complete with a fine selection|of Hank Williams.
{12895}{12953}That was also when Warden Norton...
{12959}{13047}...instituted his famous|"Inside Out" program.
{13061}{13123}You may remember reading about it.
{13130}{13222}It made the papers|and got his picture in Look magazine.
{13229}{13268}It's no free ride...
{13274}{13371}..but rather a genuine|progressive advance...
{13377}{13451}...in corrections and rehabilitation.
{13462}{13537}Our inmates, properly supervised...
{13544}{13623}...will be put to work|outside these walls...
{13629}{13736}...performing all manner|of public service.
{13744}{13811}These men can learn the value...
{13817}{13931}...of an honest day's labor and|provide a service to the community...
{13937}{14078}...at a bare minimum of expense|to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.
{14091}{14161}Of course he didn't tell the press...
{14167}{14270}...that "bare minimum of expense"|is a fairly loose term.
{14277}{14368}There are 100 different ways|to skim off the top.
{14374}{14449}Men, materials, you name it.
{14459}{14546}And oh, my Lord,|how the money rolled in!
{14552}{14627}At this rate,|you'll put me out of business.
{14634}{14767}With this pool of slave labor,|you can underbid any contractor in town.
{14784}{14873}We're providing|a valuable community service.
{14879}{14989}That's fine for the papers,|but I've got a family to feed.
{15069}{15114}We go back a long way.
{15154}{15302}I need this highway contract. I don't|get it and I go under. That's a fact.
{15329}{15383}You have some of this fine pie...
{15390}{15490}...my missus made for you.|You think about that.
{15738}{15819}I wouldn't worry too much|about this contract.
{15826}{15918}I already got my boys|committed elsewhere.
{15977}{16068}You be sure and thank Maisie|for this fine pie.
{16102}{16167}And behind every shady deal...
{16177}{16256}...behind every dollar earned...
{16264}{16356}...there was Andy, keeping the books.
{16368}{16406}Two deposits.
{16413}{16537}Maine National and New England First.|Night drops as always, sir.
{17442}{17572}Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits|for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
{17586}{17692}If they over-starch my shirts again,|they'll hear from me.
{17698}{17738}How do I look?
{17769}{17844}-Very nice.|-Big charity to-do up Portland way.
{17850}{17895}Governor will be there.
{17938}{17982}You want the rest of this?
{18022}{18080}Woman can't bake worth shit.
{18117}{18157}Thank you, sir.
{18242}{18339}He's got his fingers|in a lot of pies, from what I hear.
{18345}{18490}He's got scams you haven't even|dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks.
{18496}{18567}A river of dirty money|running through here.
{18573}{18688}Sooner or later, he'll have to|explain where it came from.
{18694}{18747}That's where I come in.
{18765}{18834}I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.
{18840}{18925}Stocks, securities,|tax-free municipals.
{18935}{19041}I send it out into the real world,|and when it comes back....
{19047}{19136}-Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh?|-Cleaner.
{19154}{19262}By the time Norton retires,|I'll have made him a millionaire.
{19332}{19462}If they ever catch on, he'll wind up|in here wearing a number himself.
{19470}{19551}I thought you had|more faith in me than that.
{19557}{19647}I know you're good,|but all that paper leaves a trail.
{19654}{19756}Now anybody gets curious,|FBI, IRS...
{19762}{19792}...whatever.
{19805}{19844}It'll lead to somebody.
{19850}{19966}Sure it is, but not to me,|and certainly not to the warden.
{20097}{20126}All right, who?
{20133}{20181}Randall Stevens.
{20197}{20225}Who?
{20231}{20291}The "silent" silent partner.
{20297}{20389}He's the guilty one,|the man with the bank accounts.
{20395}{20460}It's where the filtering|process starts.
{20466}{20552}They trace anything,|it'll just lead to him.
{20570}{20607}But who is he?
{20613}{20731}He's a phantom, an apparition.|Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.
{20765}{20799}I conjured him...
{20806}{20847}...out of thin air.
{20871}{20953}He doesn't exist, except on paper.
{21045}{21116}You can't just make a person up.
{21122}{21215}Sure you can,|if you know how the system works.
{21230}{21315}It's amazing what you|can accomplish by mail.
{21325}{21404}Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...
{21410}{21473}...driver's license, Social Security.
{21482}{21512}You're shitting me.
{21518}{21619}If they trace any accounts,|they'll wind up chasing...
{21625}{21677}...a figment of my imagination.
{21683}{21743}Well, I'll be damned!
{21783}{21835}Did I say you were good?
{21846}{21895}Shit, you are Rembrandt.
{21917}{21969}The funny thing is...
{21975}{22097}...on the outside, I was an honest man,|straight as an arrow.
{22110}{22180}I had to come to prison to be a crook.
{22446}{22485}Ever bother you?
{22528}{22620}I don't run the scams.|I just process the profits.
{22628}{22688}A fine line, maybe...
{22705}{22766}...but I also built that library...
{22773}{22863}...and used it to help guys|get their high school diploma.
{22870}{22937}Why do you think|he lets me do all that?
{22943}{23009}Keep you happy and doing the laundry.
{23015}{23059}Money instead of sheets.
{23070}{23148}Well, I work cheap.|That's the tradeoff.
{23665}{23744}Tommy Williams|came to Shawshank in 1965...
{23751}{23818}...on a two-year stretch for B and E.
{23825}{23895}That's breaking and entering to you.
{23903}{24030}Cops caught him sneaking TV sets|out the back door of a JC Penney.
{24043}{24082}Young punk.
{24088}{24137}Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...
{24143}{24188}...cocky as hell.
{24195}{24267}Come on, old boys.|Moving like molasses!
{24274}{24327}Making me look bad.
{24333}{24387}We liked him immediately.
{24394}{24506}I'm backing out the door|and I got the TV like this.
{24515}{24624}A big old thing. I couldn't see shit.|Then I hear this voice.
{24643}{24702}"Freeze, kid, hands in the air."
{24708}{24842}I was standing there, holding onto|that TV. Finally the voice says:
{24848}{24962}"You hear what I said, boy?"|I say, "Yes, sir. I did.
{24968}{25071}But if I drop this, you get me|on destruction of property too."
{25206}{25275}You done some stretch|in Cashman, right?
{25290}{25409}Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,|let me tell you.
{25417}{25475}Weekend furloughs.|Work programs.
{25481}{25513}Not like here.
{25519}{25592}Sounds like you done time all over.
{25605}{25677}I've been in and out since I was 1 3.
{25683}{25749}Name it, chances are I've been there.
{25755}{25835}Perhaps you should try a new profession.
{25878}{25925}What I mean is...
{25935}{26038}...you're not a very good thief.|You should try something else.
{26045}{26142}Yeah, what the hell|you know about it, Capone?
{26154}{26202}What are you in for?
{26210}{26240}Me?
{26313}{26362}A lawyer fucked me.
{26480}{26569}Everybody's innocent in here.|Don't you know that?
{26806}{26938}As it turned out, Tommy had himself|a young wife and a new baby girl.
{26955}{27019}Maybe he thought of them|on the streets...
{27025}{27099}...or his child growing up|not knowing her daddy.
{27109}{27150}Whatever it was...
{27160}{27233}...something lit a fire|under that boy's ass.
{27348}{27434}Thought I might try for|my high school equivalency.
{27440}{27515}Hear you helped|a couple of fellas with that.
{27556}{27623}I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.
{27665}{27740}I ain't no goddamn loser.
{27792}{27847}-You mean that?|-Yeah.
{27897}{27940}You really mean that?
{27971}{28012}Yes, sir, I do.
{28018}{28077}Good. Because if we do this...
{28083}{28201}...we do it all the way,|a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.
{28209}{28263}Thing is, see...
{28301}{28347}...I don't read so good.
{28382}{28415}"Well."
{28475}{28527}You don't read...
{28534}{28579}...so well.
{28650}{28694}We'll get to that.
{28828}{28892}So Andy took Tommy under his wing.
{28898}{28976}Started walking him through his ABC's.
{29041}{29107}Tommy took to it pretty well too.
{29115}{29198}Boy found brains he never knew he had.
{29268}{29371}Before long, Andy started him|on his course requirements.
{29377}{29427}He really liked the kid.
{29433}{29540}Gave him a thrill to help a youngster|crawl off the shit heap.
{29555}{29623}But that wasn't the only reason.
{29644}{29710}Prison time is slow time.
{29724}{29802}So you do what you can to keep going.
{29812}{29873}Some fellas collect stamps.
{29886}{29960}Others build matchstick houses.
{29978}{30057}Andy built a library.
{30073}{30131}Now he needed a new project.
{30157}{30201}Tommy was it.
{30221}{30340}It was the same reason he spent years|shaping and polishing those rocks.
{30357}{30454}The same reason he hung|his fantasy girlies on the wall.
{30481}{30519}In prison...
{30527}{30639}...a man will do most anything|to keep his mind occupied.
{30662}{30808}By 1966, right about the time Tommy|was getting ready to take his exams...
{30815}{30880}...it was lovely Raquel.
{31377}{31406}Time.
{31588}{31617}Well?
{31666}{31730}Well, it's for shit.
{31745}{31830}I wasted a whole year|of my time with this bullshit.
{31836}{31881}It's probably not that bad.
{31887}{32014}I didn't get a thing right.|It might as well have been in Chinese.
{32020}{32072}Let's see how the score comes out.
{32078}{32167}I'll tell you|how the goddamn score comes out.
{32225}{32266}Two points, right there!
{32272}{32318}There's your goddamn score!
{32326}{32437}Goddamn cats crawling up trees,|5 times 5 is 25....
{32465}{32514}Fuck this place!
{32521}{32555}Fuck it!
{33129}{33167}I feel bad.
{33173}{33209}I let him down.
{33215}{33267}That's crap, kid.
{33273}{33313}He's proud of you.
{33323}{33409}We're old friends,|I know him as good as anybody.
{33415}{33461}Smart fellow, ain't he?
{33468}{33562}Smart as they come.|He was a banker on the outside.
{33568}{33635}What's he in here for anyway?
{33645}{33674}Murder.
{33718}{33759}The hell, you say.
{33823}{33893}You wouldn't think it|to look at the guy.
{33930}{34052}Caught his wife in bed|with some golf pro. Greased them both.
{34293}{34323}What?
{34363}{34439}About four years ago...
{34448}{34545}...I was in Thomaston|on a two-to-three stretch.
{34560}{34599}I stole a car.
{34610}{34670}It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.
{34690}{34757}About six months left to go...
{34766}{34823}...I get a new cellmate in.
{34844}{34893}Elmo Blatch.
{34914}{34954}Big, twitchy fucker.
{34980}{35084}Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.|You know what I'm saying?
{35091}{35173}Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.
{35181}{35249}Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.
{35255}{35403}Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.|You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.
{35435}{35573}Talked all the time too. That's|the other thing. He never shut up.
{35580}{35629}Places he'd been in...
{35638}{35730}...jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.
{35737}{35803}Even people he killed.
{35840}{35924}People who "gave him shit."
{35943}{35989}That's how he put it.
{36068}{36129}So one night, like a joke...
{36163}{36268}...I say to him,|"Elmo, who did you kill?"
{36275}{36307}So he says:
{36314}{36432}I got me this job one time,|busing tables at a country club...
{36453}{36570}...so I could case all these big|rich pricks that come in.
{36633}{36693}So I pick out this guy...
{36720}{36767}...go in one night...
{36773}{36825}...and do his place.
{36868}{36908}He wakes up...
{36930}{36983}...and gives me shit.
{37015}{37064}So I killed him.
{37118}{37203}Him and this tasty bitch he was with.
{37245}{37313}And that's the best part.
{37333}{37407}She's fucking this prick, see...
{37413}{37504}...this golf pro,|but she's married to some other guy.
{37523}{37599}Some hotshot banker.
{37643}{37718}And he's the one they pinned it on.
{38062}{38178}I have to say that's|the most amazing story I ever heard.
{38216}{38291}What amazes me most|is you'd be taken in by it.
{38313}{38342}Sir?
{38409}{38517}It's obvious this fellow Williams|is impressed with you.
{38535}{38653}He hears your tale of woe|and naturally wants to cheer you up.
{38659}{38724}He's young, not terribly bright.
{38740}{38843}It's not surprising he wouldn't|know what a state he put you in.
{38855}{38902}Sir, he's telling the truth.
{38925}{39050}Let's say for the moment|this Blatch does exist.
{39058}{39197}You think he'd just fall to his knees|and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.
{39203}{39284}By the way,|add a life term to my sentence."
{39290}{39374}With Tommy's testimony,|I can get a new trial.
{39380}{39454}That's assuming Blatch is still there.
{39461}{39519}Chances are, he'd be released by now.
{39525}{39599}They'd have his last known address.
{39605}{39663}It's a chance, isn't it?
{39733}{39785}How can you be so obtuse?
{39813}{39842}What?
{39888}{39932}What did you call me?
{39938}{39990}Obtuse. Is it deliberate?
{40001}{40046}You're forgetting yourself.
{40056}{40144}The country club|will have his old timecards.
{40150}{40233}Records, W-2s with his name on them.
{40239}{40320}If you want to indulge this fantasy,|it's your business.
{40326}{40403}Don't make it mine.|This meeting is over.
{40410}{40488}If I got out, I'd never mention|what happens here.
{40507}{40596}I'd be as indictable as you|for laundering that money.
{40652}{40740}Don't ever mention money to me,|you son of a bitch!
{40746}{40795}Not in this office...
{40802}{40860}...not anywhere.|Get in here, now!
{40867}{40948}I just wanted to put you at ease,|that's all.
{40967}{41005}Solitary. A month.
{41035}{41074}What's wrong with you?
{41080}{41119}Get him out of here.
{41125}{41172}This is my chance to get out!
{41178}{41232}It's my life! Understand?!
{41238}{41300}Get him out!
{41353}{41412}A month in the hole.
{41418}{41499}That's the longest stretch|I ever heard of.
{41505}{41544}It's all my fault.
{41550}{41597}Bullshit.
{41618}{41699}You didn't pull the trigger|or convict him.
{41705}{41777}Are you saying Andy is innocent?
{41783}{41843}I mean, for real innocent?
{41850}{41890}It looks that way.
{41903}{41960}Sweet Jesus.
{41968}{42023}How long has he been here now?
{42035}{42133}1 947. What is that?|Nineteen years.
{42140}{42218}-Williams, Thomas.|-Yeah, over here.
{42393}{42428}What you got?
{42447}{42487}Board of Education.
{42493}{42539}That son of a bitch mailed it.
{42545}{42663}You going to open it or stand there|with your thumb up your butt?
{42670}{42735}Thumb up my butt sounds better.
{42750}{42835}Skeets, come on.|Give me that, you shithead.
{42860}{42900}Floyd, come on.
{43063}{43135}Will you throw that away, please?
{43303}{43355}Well, shit.
{43735}{43819}The kid passed. C + average.
{43825}{43887}Thought you'd like to know.
{44374}{44418}Warden wants to talk.
{44830}{44861}Out here?
{44868}{44935}That's what the man said.
{45418}{45447}Warden?
{45748}{45869}I'm asking you to keep this conversation|just between us.
{45915}{45983}I feel awkward enough as it is.
{46536}{46598}We got a situation here.
{46624}{46687}I think you can appreciate that.
{46693}{46730}Yes, sir.
{46738}{46780}I sure can.
{46788}{46908}I tell you, son, this thing really|came along and knocked my wind out.
{46953}{47030}It's got me up nights.|That's the truth.
{47098}{47153}The right thing to do...
{47203}{47315}...sometimes it's hard to know|what that is.
{47345}{47388}Do you understand?
{47457}{47505}I need your help, son.
{47548}{47612}If I'm going to move on this...
{47623}{47718}...there can't be|the least little shred of doubt.
{47740}{47772}I have to know...
{47778}{47857}...if what you told Dufresne|was the truth.
{47863}{47897}Yes, sir.
{47903}{47940}Absolutely.
{47955}{48045}Would you be willing to swear|before a judge and jury...
{48051}{48111}...with your hand on the Good Book...
{48117}{48197}...and take an oath|before Almighty God himself?
{48203}{48257}Just give me that chance.
{48385}{48425}That's what I thought.
{49836}{49893}I'm sure by now you've heard.
{49946}{49976}Terrible thing.
{50025}{50069}A man that young...
{50079}{50157}...less than a year to go,|trying to escape.
{50173}{50247}Broke Captain Hadley's heart|to shoot him.
{50270}{50315}Truly, it did.
{50405}{50478}We just have to put it behind us.
{50528}{50564}Move on.
{50613}{50657}I'm done.
{50697}{50745}Everything stops.
{50805}{50875}Get someone else to run your scams.
{50913}{50968}Nothing stops.
{51008}{51042}Nothing.
{51145}{51238}Or you will do|the hardest time there is.
{51250}{51319}No more protection from the guards.
{51326}{51473}I'll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton|and cast you down with the sodomites.
{51515}{51588}You'll think you've been|fucked by a train.
{51630}{51675}And the library?
{51695}{51724}Gone.
{51743}{51820}Sealed off, brick by brick.
{51834}{51914}We'll have us a little|book barbecue in the yard.
{51920}{51984}They'll see the flames for miles.
{51990}{52075}We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.
{52113}{52202}You understand me? Catching my drift?
{52315}{52371}Or am I being obtuse?
{52724}{52803}Give him another month|to think about it.
{54204}{54295}My wife used to say|I'm a hard man to know.
{54320}{54375}Like a closed book.
{54399}{54459}Complained about it all the time.
{54488}{54535}She was beautiful.
{54607}{54652}God, I loved her.
{54764}{54831}I didn't know how|to show it, that's all.
{54913}{54963}I killed her, Red.
{55019}{55073}I didn't pull the trigger...
{55116}{55168}...but I drove her away.
{55213}{55294}That's why she died, because of me...
{55300}{55341}...the way I am.
{55611}{55666}That don't make you a murderer.
{55767}{55820}Bad husband, maybe.
{55929}{56027}Feel bad about it if you want,|but you didn't pull the trigger.
{56033}{56073}No, I didn't.
{56085}{56143}Somebody else did.
{56180}{56243}And I wound up in here.
{56317}{56365}Bad luck, I guess.
{56521}{56564}It floats around.
{56595}{56662}It's got to land on somebody.
{56689}{56746}It was my turn, that's all.
{56767}{56850}I was in the path of the tornado.
{57028}{57146}I just didn't expect the storm|would last as long as it has.
{57277}{57327}Think you'll ever get out of here?
{57365}{57396}Me?
{57485}{57515}Yeah.
{57555}{57624}One day, when I got|a long, white beard...
{57630}{57725}...and two or three marbles|rolling around upstairs.
{57786}{57835}I tell you where I'd go.
{57879}{57929}Zihuatanejo.
{57955}{57990}Say what?
{58000}{58055}Zihuatanejo.
{58083}{58132}It's in Mexico.
{58174}{58238}A little place on the Pacific Ocean.
{58272}{58356}You know what the Mexicans say|about the Pacific?
{58410}{58469}They say it has no memory.
{58529}{58609}That's where I want to live|the rest of my life.
{58658}{58732}A warm place with no memory.
{58830}{58888}Open up a little hotel...
{58939}{58983}...right on the beach.
{59002}{59068}Buy some worthless old boat...
{59084}{59133}...and fix it up new.
{59215}{59252}Take my guests out...
{59277}{59318}...charter fishing.
{59433}{59485}Zihuatanejo.
{59591}{59707}In a place like that, I could use|a man that knows how to get things.
{59903}{59988}I don't think I could make it|on the outside.
{60188}{60250}I been in here most of my life.
{60293}{60346}I'm an institutional man now.
{60373}{60425}Just like Brooks was.
{60469}{60520}You underestimate yourself.
{60537}{60585}I don't think so.
{60700}{60818}In here I'm the guy who can get things|for you, sure, but...
{60841}{60916}...outside all you need|is the Yellow Pages.
{60923}{60990}Hell, I wouldn't know|where to begin.
{61054}{61103}Pacific Ocean?
{61115}{61152}Shit.
{61163}{61229}Scare me to death,|something that big.
{61235}{61274}Not me.
{61310}{61393}I didn't shoot my wife,|and I didn't shoot her lover.
{61445}{61542}Whatever mistakes I made,|I've paid for them and then some.
{61573}{61617}That hotel, that boat....
{61671}{61738}I don't think that's too much to ask.
{61885}{61958}You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.
{61964}{62024}This is just shitty pipe dreams.
{62038}{62112}Mexico is way down there|and you're in here...
{62118}{62164}...and that's the way it is.
{62175}{62260}Yeah, right.|That's the way it is.
{62305}{62377}It's down there and I'm in here.
{62454}{62536}I guess it comes down|to a simple choice.
{62623}{62668}Get busy living...
{62709}{62769}...or get busy dying.
{63133}{63215}If you ever get out of here,|do me a favor.
{63221}{63289}Sure, Andy. Anything.
{63345}{63461}There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.|You know where Buxton is?
{63505}{63598}-A lot of hayfields up there.|-One in particular.
{63605}{63723}It's got a long rock wall|with a big oak tree at the north end.
{63729}{63815}It's like something|out of a Robert Frost poem.
{63843}{63917}It's where I asked my wife to marry me.
{63960}{64022}We went there for a picnic...
{64035}{64097}...and made love under that oak...
{64118}{64185}...and I asked and she said yes.
{64305}{64360}Promise me, Red.
{64385}{64434}If you ever get out...
{64440}{64484}...find that spot.
{64520}{64665}At the base of that wall, there's a rock|that has no earthly business in Maine.
{64699}{64789}Piece of black, volcanic glass.
{64870}{64949}Something's buried under it|I want you to have.
{64973}{65010}What, Andy?
{65023}{65075}What's buried under there?
{65123}{65179}You'll have to pry it up...
{65185}{65222}...to see.
{65399}{65458}No, I'm telling you. The guy is....
{65478}{65530}He's talking funny.
{65563}{65614}I'm really worried about him.
{65626}{65669}Let's keep an eye on him.
{65675}{65773}That's fine during the day,|but at night he's all alone.
{65816}{65849}Oh, Lord.
{65890}{65915}What?
{65960}{66043}Andy come down|to the loading dock today.
{66049}{66111}He asked me for a length of rope.
{66118}{66143}Rope?
{66149}{66199}Six feet long.
{66206}{66247}And you gave it to him.
{66273}{66327}Sure. Why wouldn't l?
{66333}{66379}Jesus! Heywood.
{66398}{66457}How was I supposed to know?
{66463}{66509}Remember Brooks Hatlen?
{66570}{66628}Andy would never do that.
{66646}{66678}Never.
{66740}{66780}I don't know.
{66865}{66925}Every man has his breaking point.
{66996}{67064}Lickety-split.|Want to get home.
{67073}{67126}Just about finished, sir.
{67639}{67688}Three deposits tonight.
{67927}{67984}Get my stuff down to the laundry.
{67990}{68038}And shine my shoes.
{68045}{68133}-I want them looking like mirrors.|-Yes, sir.
{68298}{68342}It's good having you back.
{68370}{68426}Place wasn't the same without you.
{69831}{69862}Lights out!
{70847}{70922}I've had some long nights in stir.
{70939}{71019}Alone in the dark|with nothing but your thoughts...
{71025}{71105}...time can draw out like a blade.
{71265}{71354}That was the longest night of my life.
{71830}{71864}Give me a count!
{72000}{72085}Tier 3 south, clear!
{72179}{72274}Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!
{72280}{72312}Dufresne!
{72328}{72401}Come out. You're holding up the show!
{72495}{72597}Don't make me come down|or I'll thump your skull for you!
{72824}{72939}Damn it, you're putting me behind!|I got a schedule to keep.
{72945}{73044}You'd better be sick or dead in there.|I shit you not!
{73050}{73090}You hear me?
{73273}{73335}Oh, my Holy God.
{73845}{73922}I want every man|on this cellblock questioned.
{73935}{74011}-Start with that friend of his.|-Who?
{74089}{74136}Open 237.
{74241}{74350}What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"?|Don't say that to me.
{74377}{74417}Don't tell me that again.
{74423}{74454}But sir, he wasn't.
{74461}{74564}I can see that, Haig!|Think I'm blind?
{74585}{74627}Is that what you're saying?
{74633}{74712}-Am I blind, Haig?|-No, sir!
{74740}{74814}What about you. You blind?
{74830}{74906}-Tell me what this is.|-Last night's count.
{74913}{75012}You see Dufresne's name there?|I sure do. Right there.
{75018}{75058}"Dufresne."
{75108}{75152}He was in his cell...
{75159}{75188}...at lights out.
{75194}{75262}Reasonable he'd be here in the morning.
{75293}{75342}I want him found.
{75348}{75452}Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!
{75459}{75495}Yes, sir.
{75525}{75593}Let's go. Move your butts.
{75695}{75724}Stand.
{75768}{75800}Well?
{75903}{75932}Well, what?
{75939}{76043}I see you two all the time.|You're thick as thieves, you are.
{76075}{76119}He must have said something.
{76142}{76187}No, sir, Warden.
{76199}{76228}Not a word.
{76283}{76360}Lord, it's a miracle!
{76378}{76454}Man vanished like a fart in the wind.
{76475}{76509}Nothing left...
{76535}{76616}...but some damn rocks|on a windowsill.
{76623}{76705}And that cupcake on the wall.|Let's ask her.
{76711}{76764}Maybe she knows.
{76771}{76853}What say there, fuzzy-britches?|Feel like talking?
{76896}{76935}Guess not.
{76952}{77017}Why should she be any different?
{77050}{77100}This is a conspiracy.
{77119}{77174}That's what this is.
{77192}{77304}One big, damn conspiracy!
{77312}{77371}And everyone's in on it!
{77391}{77426}Including her!
{78476}{78526}In 1966...
{78533}{78605}...Andy Dufresne escaped...
{78611}{78657}...from Shawshank Prison.
{78725}{78802}All they found|was a muddy set of prison clothes...
{78821}{78866}...a bar of soap...
{78873}{78919}...and an old rock hammer...
{78926}{79000}...damn near worn down to the nub.
{79135}{79278}I had thought it'd take a man 600 years|to tunnel through the wall with it.
{79297}{79376}Old Andy did it in less than 20.
{79924}{79993}Oh, Andy loved geology.
{80016}{80111}I imagine it appealed to his|meticulous nature.
{80123}{80178}An ice age here...
{80191}{80265}...million years|of mountain building there.
{80296}{80381}Geology is the study|of pressure and time.
{80406}{80466}That's all it takes, really.
{80488}{80520}Pressure...
{80540}{80578}...and time.
{80618}{80680}That and a big goddamn poster.
{80801}{80829}Like I said...
{80844}{80963}...in prison, a man will do anything|to keep his mind occupied.
{81048}{81192}Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting|his wall out into the exercise yard...
{81208}{81266}...a handful at a time.
{81305}{81366}I guess after Tommy was killed...
{81373}{81462}...Andy decided|he'd been here long enough.
{81468}{81544}Lickety-split.|I want to get home.
{81567}{81627}I'm just about finished, sir.
{82271}{82329}Three deposits tonight.
{82548}{82617}Andy did like he was told.
{82623}{82727}Buffed those shoes|to a high mirror-shine.
{82838}{82907}The guards simply didn't notice.
{82916}{82960}Neither did l.
{82966}{83011}I mean, seriously...
{83018}{83107}...how often do you really look|at a man's shoes?
{86811}{86905}Andy crawled to freedom|through 500 yards...
{86913}{87013}...of shit-smelling foulness|I can't even imagine.
{87043}{87113}Or maybe I just don't want to.
{87245}{87316}Five hundred yards.
{87331}{87422}That's the length|of five football fields.
{87442}{87518}Just shy of half a mile.
{89174}{89311}The next morning, right about the time|Raquel was spilling her secret...
{89321}{89406}...a man nobody ever|laid eyes on before...
{89413}{89490}...strolled into|the Maine National Bank.
{89508}{89602}Until that moment,|he didn't exist.
{89620}{89691}-Except on paper.|-May I help you?
{89703}{89761}He had all the proper ID...
{89767}{89878}...driver's license, birth certificate,|Social Security card....
{89891}{89966}And the signature|was a spot-on match.
{89973}{90066}I must say I'm sorry|to be losing your business.
{90072}{90124}I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.
{90148}{90181}Thank you.
{90201}{90235}I'm sure I will.
{90263}{90363}Here's your cashier's check, sir.|Will there be anything else?
{90369}{90398}Please.
{90416}{90491}Would you add this|to your outgoing mail?
{90506}{90541}I'd be happy to.
{90596}{90636}Good day, sir.
{90664}{90797}Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks|in the Portland area that morning.
{90811}{90859}All told, he blew town...
{90865}{91010}...with better than $370,000|of Warden Norton's money.
{91031}{91114}Severance pay for 19 years.
{91331}{91396}Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.
{92981}{93069}Byron Hadley?|You have the right to remain silent.
{93077}{93210}If you give up this right, anything you|say can be held against you in court.
{93223}{93357}I wasn't there to see, but I hear|Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...
{93363}{93407}...when they took him away.
{93584}{93686}Norton had no intention|of going that quietly.
{94161}{94186}Samuel Norton.
{94210}{94283}We have a warrant|for your arrest. Open up.
{94425}{94458}Open the door.
{94474}{94512}I'm not sure which key.
{94816}{94874}Make it easy on yourself, Norton!
{95219}{95322}I like to think the last thing|that went through his head...
{95329}{95377}...other than that bullet...
{95383}{95516}...was to wonder how the hell|Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.
{95591}{95694}Not long after the warden|deprived us of his company...
{95703}{95764}...I got a postcard in the mail.
{95809}{95894}It was blank,|but the postmark said...
{95900}{95964}...Fort Hancock, Texas.
{95980}{96021}Fort Hancock...
{96029}{96081}...right on the border.
{96093}{96152}That's where Andy crossed.
{96170}{96294}When I picture him heading south|in his own car with the top down...
{96304}{96371}...it always makes me laugh.
{96426}{96473}Andy Dufresne...
{96484}{96544}...who crawled through|a river of shit...
{96551}{96623}...and came out clean|on the other side.
{96648}{96689}Andy Dufresne...
{96713}{96761}...headed for the Pacific.
{96850}{96915}Hadley's got him|by the throat, right?
{96921}{97035}He says, "l believe this boy's|about to have himself an accident."
{97041}{97127}Those of us who knew him best|talk about him often.
{97147}{97197}I swear, the stuff he pulled....
{97204}{97293}"My friends could use|a couple of beers."
{97303}{97352}And he got it!
{97390}{97462}Sometimes it makes me sad, though...
{97470}{97513}...Andy being gone.
{97534}{97658}I have to remind myself that|some birds aren't meant to be caged.
{97672}{97733}Their feathers are just too bright.
{97785}{97836}And when they fly away...
{97850}{97982}...the part of you that knows it was|a sin to lock them up does rejoice.
{98014}{98052}But still...
{98066}{98196}...the place you live in is that much|more drab and empty that they're gone.
{98322}{98393}I guess I just miss my friend.
{99133}{99161}Please sit down.
{99336}{99382}Ellis Boyd Redding...
{99399}{99496}...your files say you've served|40 years of a life sentence.
{99521}{99585}You feel you've been rehabilitated?
{99641}{99687}Rehabilitated?
{99749}{99806}Well, now, let me see.
{99836}{99906}I don't have any idea|what that means.
{99969}{100037}It means you're ready|to rejoin society--
{100054}{100124}I know what you think it means, sonny.
{100189}{100248}To me it's just a made-up word.
{100289}{100359}A politician's word so that...
{100372}{100477}...young fellas like yourself|can wear a suit and a tie...
{100492}{100539}...and have a job.
{100599}{100661}What do you really want to know?
{100685}{100744}Am I sorry for what I did?
{100757}{100791}Well, are you?
{100849}{100934}There's not a day goes by|I don't feel regret.
{100975}{101078}Not because I'm in here|or because you think I should.
{101183}{101260}I look back on the way I was then...
{101324}{101359}...a young...
{101392}{101496}...stupid kid who committed|that terrible crime.
{101587}{101638}I want to talk to him.
{101696}{101770}I want to try|and talk some sense to him.
{101792}{101850}Tell him the way things are.
{101913}{101956}But I can't.
{102022}{102081}That kid's long gone...
{102118}{102201}...and this old man is all that's left.
{102243}{102287}I got to live with that.
{102328}{102378}Rehabilitated?
{102390}{102445}It's just a bullshit word.
{102473}{102616}So you go on and stamp your forms,|sonny, and stop wasting my time.
{102653}{102721}Because to tell you the truth...
{102731}{102790}...I don't give a shit.
{105384}{105426}Here you go, miss.
{105514}{105544}Restroom break?
{105719}{105854}You don't need to ask me every time|you need to go take a piss. Just go.
{106246}{106337}Forty years I've been asking|permission to piss.
{106363}{106453}I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.
{106558}{106622}There's a harsh truth to face.
{106673}{106760}No way I'm going to make it|on the outside.
{106996}{107106}All I do anymore is think of ways|to break my parole...
{107131}{107205}...so maybe they'd send me back.
{107361}{107434}Terrible thing, to live in fear.
{107461}{107510}Brooks Hatlen knew it.
{107517}{107575}Knew it all too well.
{107623}{107725}All I want is to be back|where things make sense.
{107738}{107819}Where I won't have to be afraid|all the time.
{107880}{107951}Only one thing stops me.
{107994}{108066}A promise I made to Andy.
{108681}{108714}There it is.
{109033}{109082}Much obliged, sir.
{115656}{115693}Dear Red:
{115701}{115775}If you're reading this,|you've gotten out...
{115781}{115902}...and if you've come this far,|maybe you'd come a bit further.
{115911}{115985}You remember the name|of the town, don't you?
{116054}{116098}Zihuatanejo.
{116148}{116255}I could use a good man|to help me get my project on wheels.
{116271}{116376}I'll keep an eye out for you,|and the chessboard ready.
{116401}{116443}Remember, Red...
{116453}{116516}...hope is a good thing...
{116522}{116581}...maybe the best of things.
{116588}{116653}And no good thing ever dies.
{116669}{116755}I will be hoping|that this letter finds you...
{116761}{116813}...and finds you well.
{116828}{116864}Your friend...
{116871}{116905}...Andy.
{117920}{117971}"Get busy living...
{117978}{118035}...or get busy dying. "
{118116}{118180}That's goddamn right.
{118338}{118402}For the second time in my life...
{118409}{118485}...I'm guilty of committing a crime.
{118518}{118576}Parole violation.
{118596}{118705}Of course I doubt they'll toss up|any roadblocks for that.
{118726}{118786}Not for an old crook like me.
{118793}{118854}Fort Hancock, Texas, please.
{118964}{119106}I find I'm so excited I can barely|sit still or hold a thought in my head.
{119119}{119219}I think it's the excitement|only a free man can feel.
{119225}{119299}A free man at the start|of a long journey...
{119306}{119383}...whose conclusion is uncertain.
{119474}{119554}I hope I can make it across the border.
{119599}{119689}I hope to see my friend|and shake his hand.
{119746}{119867}I hope the Pacific is as blue|as it has been in my dreams.
{119923}{119959}I hope.
