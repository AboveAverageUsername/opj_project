2
00:00:12,437 --> 00:00:13,437
There's still a stain, look!

3
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:17,437
Some stains don't come out.
That'll teach you to be neater.

4
00:00:24,437 --> 00:00:28,437
- There you are.
- Thank you.

5
00:00:28,437 --> 00:00:32,437
You have a ticket?

6
00:00:39,437 --> 00:00:43,437
Your package...

7
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:47,437
- Ticket please?
- It's a suit.

8
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:51,437
How interesting.

9
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,437
You've got it? Is it clean?

10
00:01:13,437 --> 00:01:16,437
I've just chosen the most stunning
pair of shoes.

11
00:01:16,437 --> 00:01:20,437
I want you to see them.

12
00:01:20,437 --> 00:01:24,437
Do us a favor
and wrap it up once more.

13
00:01:24,437 --> 00:01:26,437
I'm sorry, but there's a paper
shortage in the country.

14
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:30,437
Why is it that generals always have
the same kind of wife?

15
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:33,437
I would have made a perfect
general's wife!

16
00:01:33,437 --> 00:01:37,437
For that you would have
to marry a lieutenant first

17
00:01:37,437 --> 00:01:41,437
and for years move with him
from one small town to another.

18
00:01:41,437 --> 00:01:44,437
In life, there's such a thing
as luck, you know.

19
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,437
That's why I buy a lottery ticket
every week.

20
00:01:46,437 --> 00:01:48,437
You win yet?

21
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:52,437
Sure I did. I won a ruble twice.

22
00:02:02,437 --> 00:02:06,437
It's the categorical imperative.
It was Kant who thought of it.

23
00:02:06,437 --> 00:02:10,437
Mankind should work
for the maximum...

24
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:15,437
- That's Gourin.
- Where?

25
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:19,437
There must be a certificate
that goes with it.

26
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:32,437
How you doing? Want a drink?

27
00:02:32,437 --> 00:02:35,437
- Want some vodka instead?
- Yeah, just a little.

28
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:37,437
Excuse me, are you Gourin?

29
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:41,437
Everything is okay.

30
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:14,437
To solve these problems
is yourjob.

31
00:03:15,437 --> 00:03:19,437
You're being paid for it.

32
00:03:19,437 --> 00:03:22,437
I don't want to hear
that something can't be done.

33
00:03:22,437 --> 00:03:26,437
I'm interested in what you're doing
so that it will be done!

34
00:03:30,437 --> 00:03:34,437
You were right to get tough with him.

35
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:44,437
Does the chief engineer have any
questions? The director?

36
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:46,437
What were the reasons
for missing last month's

37
00:03:46,437 --> 00:03:48,437
established quotas?

38
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,437
We were short on tank trucks.

39
00:03:50,437 --> 00:03:53,437
- Why did that happen?
- Because none were empty.

40
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:57,437
- What measures have been taken?
- We even called the minister.

41
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:01,437
Sergey Stepanovich, you will
personally look into this.

42
00:04:01,437 --> 00:04:05,437
We have to determine a schedule
reducing future loading tie-ups.

43
00:04:05,437 --> 00:04:09,437
The meeting is adjourned.

44
00:04:10,437 --> 00:04:14,437
Could you tell everybody that this
afternoon meeting is being cancelled.

45
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:18,437
I'll have to be at the City Hall.

46
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:22,437
At last the municipality is taking
an interest in what we're doing.

47
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:26,437
We're holding on on sheer enthusiasm.

48
00:04:27,437 --> 00:04:31,437
It's time the government thought
about solving this problem.

49
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:38,437
Do you know how many people
are suffering from Ioneliness?

50
00:04:38,437 --> 00:04:41,437
Look at the numbers and you can see
how alarming it is!

51
00:04:41,437 --> 00:04:44,437
In Moscow alone,
it's alarming!

52
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:48,437
Loneliness is the danger
facing us.

53
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:52,437
The birthrate goes down,
alcoholism's up!

54
00:04:52,437 --> 00:04:56,437
From an economic point of view,
a single worker is inefficient.

55
00:04:59,437 --> 00:05:03,437
He can't concentrate,
he's obsessed by his Ioneliness.

56
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:07,437
- I think it's open to discussion.
- All right. Let's discuss it.

57
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:14,437
The club was founded
only three years ago.

58
00:05:14,437 --> 00:05:18,437
Is it a success? Have many lost souls
found one another thanks to you?

59
00:05:19,437 --> 00:05:23,437
Yes, indeed! For this period
we married twelve couples.

60
00:05:23,437 --> 00:05:27,437
Though marriage is not
our priority.

61
00:05:29,437 --> 00:05:33,437
Don't think of us as a marriage
broker. We're a friendship club.

62
00:05:33,437 --> 00:05:37,437
Today, Ionely souls don't know
how to meet one another.

63
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:41,437
People just watch television
and don't even know who lives next door.

64
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:46,437
Among those who got married,
two were living

65
00:05:46,437 --> 00:05:50,437
in the very same apartment
building.

66
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:55,437
They wouldn't have met one another,
it was only because of our club.

67
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:58,437
And that's what you call
urbanization!

68
00:05:58,437 --> 00:06:01,437
I came to enroll in the club.

69
00:06:01,437 --> 00:06:04,437
I'm sorry, but our enrollment for
unmarried women is closed.

70
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:07,437
We'll start recruiting women
at the beginning of next year.

71
00:06:07,437 --> 00:06:09,437
But you're still accepting men?

72
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:12,437
Yes, single men can join up.

73
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:14,437
Why, isn't it unfair?

74
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:18,437
We already have two single women
for every single man.

75
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:24,437
Couldn't you make an exception?

76
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:28,437
Listen, call me at the beginning
of next year.

77
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:34,437
I see. Goodbye. Don't call us,
we'll call you.

78
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,437
You can see what's going on.

79
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:41,437
You at the municipality do nothing
but talk

80
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:44,437
when you should be helping us.

81
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,437
How can we help?

82
00:06:46,437 --> 00:06:50,437
We're short of funds,
we're short of men!

83
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:55,437
You know as well as I do
that in Moscow

84
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:58,437
there're five single women
for every forty-year-old bachelor.

85
00:06:58,437 --> 00:07:01,437
But we can't abandon those
who need us!

86
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:03,437
How lucky I found you!

87
00:07:03,437 --> 00:07:07,437
Someone put me in the old group,
where all the women are grandmothers.

88
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:12,437
Well, you're not exactly
a spring chicken, either.

89
00:07:13,437 --> 00:07:16,437
I don't feel like hanging
around old women.

90
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:20,437
All right, I'll have you
transferred to the younger group,

91
00:07:20,437 --> 00:07:23,437
from 35 to 50 years old.

92
00:07:23,437 --> 00:07:25,437
Couldn't you make it younger
than that?

93
00:07:25,437 --> 00:07:29,437
There's only the group from 25
to 30, and you've got arthritis.

94
00:07:30,437 --> 00:07:34,437
You can't dance with them, so don't
come complaining to me again.

95
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:38,437
I give you my word, I won't.

96
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:41,437
All right, I'll put you
in the youngest group.

97
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:44,437
Only don't say you haven't been
warned.

98
00:07:44,437 --> 00:07:48,437
And you, please, drop in Thursday.

99
00:07:48,437 --> 00:07:52,437
You'll fill in our test forms,
and then we'll send you an invitation.

100
00:07:53,437 --> 00:07:57,437
- Thank you. Good afternoon.
- See you Thursday.

101
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:03,437
How about that? Chief engineer
in a factory and he comes to us.

102
00:08:05,437 --> 00:08:09,437
99 percent are intellectuals.
They suffer more than the others.

103
00:08:09,437 --> 00:08:12,437
But you should see the ladies.
Gorgeous human beings!

104
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:14,437
Well-bred, intelligent
and pretty too!

105
00:08:14,437 --> 00:08:17,437
You wonder what do men want.
It's a mystery.

106
00:08:17,437 --> 00:08:21,437
Of course, that's not a problem
for you there, at the City Hall.

107
00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:25,437
Why do you say that?
I'm single, too.

108
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:27,437
Come on.

109
00:08:27,437 --> 00:08:31,437
Well, if even at the City Hall...

110
00:08:33,437 --> 00:08:37,437
Look, I might be able
to help you.

111
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:42,437
There's a man I set aside.

112
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:50,437
He's a chief executive.
And only fifty-three.

113
00:08:54,437 --> 00:08:58,437
Thank you very much.
I can cope myself.

114
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:31,437
Your rear suspension is squeaking.

115
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:35,437
And I thought
I was just imagining it.

116
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:40,437
You ought to get it fixed soon
before it gets worse.

117
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:43,437
All right, I will.

118
00:09:43,437 --> 00:09:45,437
Where are we going?

119
00:09:45,437 --> 00:09:47,437
We're going to my place.

120
00:09:47,437 --> 00:09:49,437
No, I'm not going to your place!

121
00:09:49,437 --> 00:09:53,437
Don't get nervous. My wife and
daughter are still on vacation.

122
00:09:55,437 --> 00:09:57,437
No, we shouldn't do that!

123
00:09:57,437 --> 00:10:00,437
I want you to see how I live.

124
00:10:00,437 --> 00:10:03,437
Please, say yes!

125
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:07,437
There's nothing in the fridge, but
I brought some apples from the south.

126
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:25,437
We haven't seen one another for ages!

127
00:10:26,437 --> 00:10:30,437
The last time I saw you,
it must of been the 20th of June.

128
00:10:31,437 --> 00:10:35,437
The eighteenth.

129
00:10:49,437 --> 00:10:53,437
I'm always afraid that I'll call
my wife by your name.

130
00:10:53,437 --> 00:10:57,437
I guess it's because I think of you
every minute.

131
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:14,437
No, not here, I don't want to.

132
00:11:14,437 --> 00:11:18,437
I missed you so much!

133
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:47,437
That must be my mother-in-law!

134
00:11:48,437 --> 00:11:52,437
- I'll go and look in the eye-hole.
- No, don't move.

135
00:11:53,437 --> 00:11:55,437
- Does she have a key?
- No.

136
00:11:55,437 --> 00:11:58,437
Calm down then.

137
00:11:58,437 --> 00:12:02,437
It's all my fault.
I called her from the airport.

138
00:12:06,437 --> 00:12:08,437
Now she'll have something
to tell my wife.

139
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:12,437
You can say you were sleeping.

140
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:19,437
I think she's gone.

141
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:23,437
Apparently.

142
00:12:37,437 --> 00:12:39,437
I think I'd better be going too.

143
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:42,437
You said you had the whole
evening free.

144
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:46,437
I have a lot of work to do
for the office.

145
00:12:47,437 --> 00:12:51,437
I meant it when I said
how much I missed you.

146
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,437
You're upset because of what
happened.

147
00:12:54,437 --> 00:12:58,437
You think I'm foolish.

148
00:12:58,437 --> 00:13:01,437
Come on, it could've happened
to anyone.

149
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:05,437
- Will you give me a call tonight?
- Yes, of course.

150
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:09,437
No, wait.

151
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:20,437
Don't forget, call me tonight.

152
00:13:36,437 --> 00:13:40,437
Is something wrong?

153
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:47,437
Yes, something's wrong.

154
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:46,437
Oh, flowers? Where did you get 'em?

155
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:50,437
A man gave them to me.

156
00:16:17,437 --> 00:16:21,437
When are you gonna get rid
of that piece of junk?

157
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:25,437
If you take care of a car

158
00:16:25,437 --> 00:16:27,437
it can last a hundred years.

159
00:16:27,437 --> 00:16:30,437
You've led a perfectly honest
sort of life,

160
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:34,437
and what d'ya got to show for it,
just a couple of hairs on your head.

161
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:36,437
Baldness is in style nowadays.

162
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:40,437
- Is that in style too?
- That happens when you're nervous.

163
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:48,437
What a surprise!

164
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:51,437
It's great to see you!
How did you know we were here?

165
00:16:51,437 --> 00:16:55,437
I didn't find any of you home,
so I figured you were in the country.

166
00:16:57,437 --> 00:16:59,437
I came to say goodbye.

167
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:03,437
I've decided to go home.
I've hung around Moscow for too long.

168
00:17:05,437 --> 00:17:09,437
I owe you money. I'll send it
when I get my first paycheck.

169
00:17:11,437 --> 00:17:13,437
Are there a lot of people under you?

170
00:17:13,437 --> 00:17:15,437
Nearly three thousand.

171
00:17:15,437 --> 00:17:18,437
Organizing all that must be
very hard work.

172
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:22,437
It's hard getting the first three
workers organized, then it's easy.

173
00:17:22,437 --> 00:17:25,437
- Is something wrong, mother?
- I'm all right, go on talking.

174
00:17:25,437 --> 00:17:29,437
I'm always holding you up to the
children as an example.

175
00:17:29,437 --> 00:17:32,437
You've achieved everything
you wanted to.

176
00:17:32,437 --> 00:17:36,437
Only don't tell them that once
you've gotten everything you wanted

177
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:40,437
you feel like howling.

178
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,437
- You ought to get married.
- It's not a question of marriage.

179
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:49,437
It is. Though it's not easy
in your line of work.

180
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:53,437
Men are afraid of women
who earn more than they do.

181
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:58,437
Where are the men nowadays?
They're getting fat and lazy.

182
00:17:58,437 --> 00:18:02,437
You go to the theatre or museum and
what do you see? Only women.

183
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:06,437
The men are watching television
or drinking with their friends.

184
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:10,437
Once they reach forty, they vegetate.

185
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:14,437
They don't even polish their shoes,
it's disgusting!

186
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:18,437
I hate men who wear dirty shoes.
It's crude.

187
00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:22,437
You ought to be prosecuted for
exploiting a skilled worker.

188
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:26,437
It was your idea to put some away
for the winter, so don't complain.

189
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:28,437
Do you know that Ghena brought
a girl friend along?

190
00:18:28,437 --> 00:18:32,437
I'd better go before his father
says something stupid.

191
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:37,437
- Gourin came over.
- He's been drinking again?

192
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:41,437
No, he's fine. He's like that every
time he comes out of the hospital.

193
00:18:41,437 --> 00:18:45,437
That explains why he hasn't come
around begging for a while.

194
00:18:46,437 --> 00:18:49,437
He was such a nice guy!

195
00:18:49,437 --> 00:18:53,437
It's because he was so nice
that he became like that.

196
00:18:54,437 --> 00:18:57,437
Everybody wanted to drink with him,

197
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:00,437
and he couldn't refuse
because he was too nice.

198
00:19:00,437 --> 00:19:04,437
Now all his friends have disappeared
and left him all alone.

199
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:09,437
I'm sure he'll get better.

200
00:19:09,437 --> 00:19:13,437
I thought so too at first,
I even took him to see doctors.

201
00:19:13,437 --> 00:19:17,437
How I begged!
I've done my best.

202
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:37,437
Marina, why don't you have
some more?

203
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:40,437
Do you know how workers were hired
in the old days?

204
00:19:40,437 --> 00:19:44,437
Shut up, I wasn't talking to you.
You're always interrupting me.

205
00:19:45,437 --> 00:19:48,437
Marina has never heard this story.

206
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,437
They gave a worker all the food
he wanted.

207
00:19:52,437 --> 00:19:56,437
If the man ate poorly,
he wasn't allowed to work there.

208
00:19:56,437 --> 00:20:00,437
What have I done wrong?
I want some bread.

209
00:20:02,437 --> 00:20:05,437
I met a client whose husband
hunts whales for a living.

210
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:09,437
They make a beauty cream on the side.

211
00:20:09,437 --> 00:20:13,437
You use a little at bedtime, and in
the morning your wrinkles disappear.

212
00:20:14,437 --> 00:20:18,437
What do they put in the cream?

213
00:20:23,437 --> 00:20:27,437
I swear, your skin'll look like
marble.

214
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:32,437
All our players have gotten jobs.

215
00:20:33,437 --> 00:20:36,437
I've been asked to coach
several times.

216
00:20:36,437 --> 00:20:40,437
For years I didn't realize
how I was living.

217
00:20:41,437 --> 00:20:45,437
I haven't been to a game
in over a year.

218
00:20:46,437 --> 00:20:48,437
No, I've got to call it quits.

219
00:20:48,437 --> 00:20:51,437
Right. You're still a young man.

220
00:20:51,437 --> 00:20:55,437
A man can start over again
if he really wants to.

221
00:21:03,437 --> 00:21:07,437
This is the pippin.
Over here we have strawberries.

222
00:21:08,437 --> 00:21:12,437
And here... Have an apple.

223
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:18,437
I did this years ago.

224
00:21:33,437 --> 00:21:37,437
You know, I've always envied you.
The love you share.

225
00:21:41,437 --> 00:21:45,437
I was told how to meet a single man.
You go to a cemetery.

226
00:21:46,437 --> 00:21:50,437
You're bound to meet an intellectual
who's a recent widower.

227
00:21:51,437 --> 00:21:52,437
You let him look at you,
and the next thing you know...

228
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:55,437
A friend of mine actually
married an architect that way.

229
00:21:55,437 --> 00:21:57,437
Liuda, you're unbelievable!

230
00:21:57,437 --> 00:22:00,437
It takes a lot of work
to make a marriage.

231
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:04,437
I'm sure that someday I'm gonna
be lucky.

232
00:22:04,437 --> 00:22:06,437
Mother, why didn't you ask me
to do that?

233
00:22:06,437 --> 00:22:10,437
I get tired just sitting around.

234
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:17,437
She's getting old, isn't she?

235
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:21,437
Her husband's death was pretty
hard on her.

236
00:22:22,437 --> 00:22:26,437
She was only five years older
than we today

237
00:22:26,437 --> 00:22:30,437
when we first met.

238
00:22:30,437 --> 00:22:34,437
As if it happened yesterday.

239
00:22:42,437 --> 00:22:46,437
Hot tea here!
Get your hot tea here.

240
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,437
That's it. I can't carry it
forever.

241
00:22:53,437 --> 00:22:57,437
Over here. Thank you, my son.

242
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:15,437
I know, I'm not proud of my shoes
either.

243
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:20,437
Well, I don't care about your shoes.

244
00:23:20,437 --> 00:23:22,437
But they upset you, don't they?

245
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:25,437
I can tell it from your face.

246
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:29,437
- Is face reading your hobby?
- Sure.

247
00:23:29,437 --> 00:23:33,437
I can tell that you're not married.

248
00:23:34,437 --> 00:23:37,437
Because you don't see a wedding ring
on my finger?

249
00:23:37,437 --> 00:23:41,437
Even if you were wearing three
wedding rings on each hand,

250
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:45,437
you still have that unmarried look
about you.

251
00:23:49,437 --> 00:23:52,437
You mean single women have
a special look about them?

252
00:23:52,437 --> 00:23:55,437
Their look is kind of searching.

253
00:23:55,437 --> 00:23:58,437
The same look police usually have,

254
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:02,437
an executive has it,
and a single woman has it too.

255
00:24:04,437 --> 00:24:07,437
- I'm in the police then.
- No.

256
00:24:07,437 --> 00:24:11,437
- An executive?
- No...

257
00:24:11,437 --> 00:24:15,437
You work in a factory, but as what?
Specialist, right?

258
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:20,437
Though I see you also in a position
of leadership.

259
00:24:20,437 --> 00:24:24,437
Maybe the factory union leader.
Is that what you do?

260
00:24:25,437 --> 00:24:28,437
Yeah, you're almost right.

261
00:24:28,437 --> 00:24:32,437
I'm a specialist myself.
A tool and die maker.

262
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:35,437
I'm single in case you're interested.

263
00:24:35,437 --> 00:24:39,437
- Then you're not so perfect.
- I've just had bad luck in marriage.

264
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:44,437
I see, you had a bitchy wife.

265
00:24:44,437 --> 00:24:48,437
No, she was sweet. She even found
herself a second husband.

266
00:24:49,437 --> 00:24:52,437
So that was your fault?

267
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:56,437
Actually I'm a very nice guy.

268
00:24:59,437 --> 00:25:01,437
And how about...?

269
00:25:01,437 --> 00:25:05,437
What? Oh, I love to have a drink!

270
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,437
But never on the job
and never on an empty stomach.

271
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:12,437
Not far from where I live there's
a pond and birch trees.

272
00:25:13,437 --> 00:25:17,437
- You sit in the shade...
- With boisterous children around.

273
00:25:18,437 --> 00:25:21,437
No, we go where no one bothers us.

274
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:24,437
And we always make sure
to leave the place clean.

275
00:25:24,437 --> 00:25:27,437
I've got a friend who has an ulcer.
He can't eat anything.

276
00:25:27,437 --> 00:25:31,437
But he likes to watch us eat.
It makes him feel good.

277
00:25:31,437 --> 00:25:34,437
When you make a sandwich of rye
bread with slices of onion

278
00:25:34,437 --> 00:25:37,437
and maybe some anchovies...

279
00:25:37,437 --> 00:25:40,437
You're already making me feel
hungry.

280
00:25:40,437 --> 00:25:43,437
You're invited then.

281
00:25:43,437 --> 00:25:47,437
I don't go any place with men
I don't know.

282
00:25:48,437 --> 00:25:52,437
- Never made an exception?
- Goodbye.

283
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:58,437
Could you carry my samovar?

284
00:25:58,437 --> 00:26:02,437
All right, but let's hurry up.

285
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:13,437
- I think I'd better see you home.
- What for?

286
00:26:13,437 --> 00:26:17,437
I happen to have five rubles,
so I can offer you a ride.

287
00:26:18,437 --> 00:26:22,437
That will be enough only for one way.

288
00:26:22,437 --> 00:26:26,437
I'm gonna walk home.
Walking never hurt anybody.

289
00:26:26,437 --> 00:26:30,437
- What is your name?
- Goga.

290
00:26:31,437 --> 00:26:34,437
But you can call me Gosha.

291
00:26:34,437 --> 00:26:38,437
All right, Goga.
That's all I need.

292
00:27:44,437 --> 00:27:48,437
You're getting home pretty late.
I've been waiting two hours for you.

293
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:53,437
- Why?
- Because I had to see you.

294
00:27:53,437 --> 00:27:55,437
- Why?
- I need you.

295
00:27:55,437 --> 00:27:59,437
All right. Come on up, I'd like you
to meet my daughter.

296
00:27:59,437 --> 00:28:03,437
- You've got a daughter?
- Are you surprised?

297
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,437
Do you have a husband waiting too?

298
00:28:10,437 --> 00:28:14,437
Is what you need an unmarried
woman?

299
00:28:16,437 --> 00:28:20,437
You and your husband had a fight
and you use me to pay him back?

300
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:25,437
With an observant mind like yours

301
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:29,437
you ought to work as a weather man.

302
00:28:32,437 --> 00:28:36,437
Come on in.

303
00:28:45,437 --> 00:28:49,437
I want you to meet a friend of mine,
Georgy.

304
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:52,437
Alexandra. Pleased to meet you.

305
00:28:52,437 --> 00:28:56,437
Put all this in the refrigerator,
will you.

306
00:29:10,437 --> 00:29:14,437
All right. No husband.

307
00:29:14,437 --> 00:29:18,437
- What do you think?
- It's all right.

308
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:25,437
- Take yourjacket off.
- And what about dinner?

309
00:29:26,437 --> 00:29:29,437
Let me rest first. I'll start
making dinner in a few minutes.

310
00:29:29,437 --> 00:29:33,437
No, just relax.

311
00:30:07,437 --> 00:30:09,437
- Are you going to eat?
- And what if I am?

312
00:30:09,437 --> 00:30:13,437
In that case you can start
peeling the onions.

313
00:30:25,437 --> 00:30:29,437
Dinner is ready!

314
00:30:31,437 --> 00:30:35,437
- How does your mother call you?
- Maroussia.

315
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:39,437
I think I'm gonna call you
Maroussia too.

316
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,437
And I'll call you Vassya.

317
00:30:41,437 --> 00:30:45,437
I've got a lot of nicknames already.

318
00:30:45,437 --> 00:30:49,437
There's Jora, Youra, Gosha, Goga,
Georgy...

319
00:30:50,437 --> 00:30:54,437
Do you work in the same factory
that mother does?

320
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:57,437
No, we don't work together.

321
00:30:57,437 --> 00:31:01,437
Though we're going to live together,
I hope.

322
00:31:07,437 --> 00:31:11,437
You mean that you want to marry her?

323
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:16,437
Yes.

324
00:31:18,437 --> 00:31:22,437
Have you known her for a long time?

325
00:31:25,437 --> 00:31:28,437
Forty-four hours and
about twenty-two minutes.

326
00:31:28,437 --> 00:31:32,437
But Mother has always been
of the opinion

327
00:31:32,437 --> 00:31:35,437
that you have to know a man well
to marry him,

328
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:38,437
and that takes time.

329
00:31:38,437 --> 00:31:42,437
Right, to marry a person
after only a two-day acquaintance

330
00:31:43,437 --> 00:31:45,437
is a very thoughtless act.

331
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:49,437
It's best to wait about a week.

332
00:31:50,437 --> 00:31:53,437
So you can let me know
next Wednesday.

333
00:31:53,437 --> 00:31:56,437
There's a good way for us
to get to know one another.

334
00:31:56,437 --> 00:32:00,437
I invite you and your mother
for a Sunday picnic in the country.

335
00:32:01,437 --> 00:32:05,437
Well, goodbye, it's been a pleasure.
Don't show me out. I know the way.

336
00:32:22,437 --> 00:32:26,437
- What does he do?
- Tool and die maker.

337
00:32:28,437 --> 00:32:32,437
- Where did you find him?
- In the train.

338
00:32:33,437 --> 00:32:37,437
I didn't know you were cruising
for men in trains.

339
00:32:38,437 --> 00:32:41,437
I'm a little surprised.

340
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:45,437
Not half as surprised as I am,
though.

341
00:32:47,437 --> 00:32:51,437
Why aren't you dressed yet?
We had a date. Did you forget?

342
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:55,437
- Forget what?
- Our picnic!

343
00:32:55,437 --> 00:32:58,437
Mother, you gotta get up!

344
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:01,437
- What's going on?
- The picnic.

345
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:05,437
For goodness sake, it's Sunday.
Let me sleep.

346
00:33:05,437 --> 00:33:09,437
You can sleep in the fresh air.

347
00:33:11,437 --> 00:33:15,437
We're being late.

348
00:33:18,437 --> 00:33:20,437
We can give you a hand with that.

349
00:33:20,437 --> 00:33:23,437
No, no, women aren't allowed
to make shashlik.

350
00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:27,437
Go and sit down.

351
00:33:34,437 --> 00:33:38,437
- Relax.
- Thank you.

352
00:34:07,437 --> 00:34:11,437
Here, chef, take this.

353
00:34:41,437 --> 00:34:45,437
Go to sleep now.

354
00:35:13,437 --> 00:35:17,437
Friends! It's a special toast that
I've the pleasure to propose today.

355
00:35:18,437 --> 00:35:22,437
This is a special occasion -

356
00:35:22,437 --> 00:35:26,437
the birthday
of our dear friend Gosha.

357
00:35:26,437 --> 00:35:29,437
- What birthday?
- You didn't tell them?

358
00:35:29,437 --> 00:35:32,437
It's no big deal.

359
00:35:32,437 --> 00:35:35,437
Oh, he's a very humble kind of guy.

360
00:35:35,437 --> 00:35:37,437
I don't think I have to remind you

361
00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:41,437
of the outstanding virtues
of our extraordinary friend.

362
00:35:42,437 --> 00:35:43,437
Yes, you do.

363
00:35:43,437 --> 00:35:47,437
Is there somebody who doesn't know
how talented and clever you are?

364
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,437
I don't know anything.

365
00:35:50,437 --> 00:35:54,437
In that case, I propose a toast
in honor of his hands.

366
00:35:55,437 --> 00:35:59,437
At first glance they're
average human hands,

367
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:03,437
but all that is just an illusion.

368
00:36:03,437 --> 00:36:07,437
Actually, they're golden hands.

369
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:13,437
We're in the presence, my friends,
of Master Tool and Die Maker!

370
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:17,437
In our Institute there are
scientists and Ph. D's

371
00:36:19,437 --> 00:36:22,437
who could have retired
ten years ago

372
00:36:22,437 --> 00:36:26,437
without anyone ever noticing

373
00:36:26,437 --> 00:36:30,437
that they have gone.

374
00:36:30,437 --> 00:36:34,437
But when Gosha was out last year
and hospitalized,

375
00:36:34,437 --> 00:36:38,437
I beg your pardon, ladies,
for getting rather personal,

376
00:36:38,437 --> 00:36:42,437
only they removed his appendix,

377
00:36:42,437 --> 00:36:46,437
well, then half of the lab
stopped dead.

378
00:36:48,437 --> 00:36:52,437
As for me, if I received a doctorate,
at least 70 percent of it comes

379
00:36:54,437 --> 00:36:58,437
from the apparatus that Gosha
invented.

380
00:36:58,437 --> 00:37:02,437
And I'm sure
that my opinion is shared

381
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:06,437
by the majority of my fellow workers
at our scientific institute.

382
00:37:07,437 --> 00:37:11,437
To your hands, my dear friend!

383
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:15,437
- Happy birthday, Gosha!
- To your hands of gold!

384
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:22,437
Well, did you like my toast?

385
00:37:22,437 --> 00:37:24,437
Have you got a Ph.D.?

386
00:37:24,437 --> 00:37:26,437
Isn't it obvious?

387
00:37:26,437 --> 00:37:30,437
- What is the world up to?
- It's winter again.

388
00:37:30,437 --> 00:37:33,437
- Winter, you think?
- Yes, it's winter, I reckon.

389
00:37:33,437 --> 00:37:37,437
Your cozy, drowsy homes
me beckon

390
00:37:39,437 --> 00:37:43,437
To come and forever in there
remain.

391
00:37:44,437 --> 00:37:48,437
- Then what's to happen?
- Then January comes.

392
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:52,437
- January, you believe?
- Yes, I believe so.

393
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:57,437
I have been reading that white book
since I began to grow,

394
00:37:58,437 --> 00:38:02,437
This time-old primer
with pictures of snow-covered stumps.

395
00:38:03,437 --> 00:38:07,437
- What'll be the outcome?
- April will dawn.

396
00:38:07,437 --> 00:38:11,437
- April, you sure?
- Yes, I am sure.

397
00:38:12,437 --> 00:38:16,437
I definitely heard,
and it wasn't some allure,

398
00:38:17,437 --> 00:38:21,437
the sound of a reed-pipe
on the neighborhood lawn.

399
00:38:21,437 --> 00:38:23,437
What's the conclusion?

400
00:38:23,437 --> 00:38:25,437
That we go on living

401
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:29,437
And make summer dresses
from gauzy cotton.

402
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:36,437
You think there'll be chance
for us to put them on?

403
00:38:36,437 --> 00:38:40,437
Just make them,
that's what I believe in!

404
00:38:41,437 --> 00:38:45,437
We should be prepared,
for however strong may be the blizzards

405
00:38:45,437 --> 00:38:49,437
Their bondage is bound
to come to an end...

406
00:38:53,437 --> 00:38:56,437
I feel bad about your birthday.
We owe you a present.

407
00:38:56,437 --> 00:39:00,437
You've got a lot of time
before December comes along.

408
00:39:02,437 --> 00:39:06,437
My birthday is the 23rd of December.

409
00:39:07,437 --> 00:39:11,437
- And what was today?
- It was an exhibition.

410
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:17,437
I was a total stranger to you,
wasn't I?

411
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:21,437
Not any more because my friends
told you everything.

412
00:39:21,437 --> 00:39:25,437
What about all these scientists
and Ph.D.'s?

413
00:39:25,437 --> 00:39:29,437
All the rest was real, the friends,
the scientists, the shashlik.

414
00:39:30,437 --> 00:39:32,437
I'm what they said I'm.

415
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:36,437
Although they put it on a little
thick, exaggerated.

416
00:39:39,437 --> 00:39:41,437
Well, we'll find out in a couple
of years.

417
00:39:41,437 --> 00:39:45,437
That's good. I was afraid that
what they said would give you

418
00:39:46,437 --> 00:39:50,437
an inferiority complex.

419
00:39:51,437 --> 00:39:53,437
I felt something like that.

420
00:39:53,437 --> 00:39:57,437
Though, I do think that in a family
the man should be superior.

421
00:39:59,437 --> 00:40:03,437
When the woman has a larger salary

422
00:40:03,437 --> 00:40:05,437
or a position of superiority,
the marriage can't work.

423
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:09,437
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely.

424
00:40:09,437 --> 00:40:13,437
I've seen enough of this already.

425
00:40:15,437 --> 00:40:19,437
How much are you making?

426
00:40:19,437 --> 00:40:22,437
Don't worry, I earn much more
than your mother does.

427
00:40:22,437 --> 00:40:25,437
We should be prepared, for
however strong may be the blizzards,

428
00:40:25,437 --> 00:40:29,437
Their bondage is bound
to come to an end!

429
00:40:31,437 --> 00:40:35,437
So allow me, Miss,
to offer my hand

430
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:41,437
For a dance at this
New Year Ball of the Wizards.

431
00:40:41,437 --> 00:40:45,437
The moon is a sphere
with a candle inside,

432
00:40:45,437 --> 00:40:49,437
The carnival figures
around us bend.

433
00:40:50,437 --> 00:40:54,437
A waltz has begun,
so give me your hand

434
00:40:55,437 --> 00:40:59,437
And go left-right,
left-right, left-right!

435
00:41:04,437 --> 00:41:07,437
Andrei, how's this?

436
00:41:07,437 --> 00:41:11,437
- Is it all right?
- It's fine.

437
00:41:19,437 --> 00:41:23,437
Don't worry, our director
is always on time.

438
00:41:26,437 --> 00:41:30,437
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

439
00:41:34,437 --> 00:41:38,437
I'll be ready in two minutes.

440
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:46,437
We can start when you want to.

441
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:49,437
Excuse me, but haven't we met before?

442
00:41:49,437 --> 00:41:52,437
Have I ever filmed you here?

443
00:41:52,437 --> 00:41:54,437
No, I think you're wrong.

444
00:41:54,437 --> 00:41:57,437
Have you ever spent
your vacations at Sochi?

445
00:41:57,437 --> 00:42:01,437
Most people have spent a vacation
at Sochi sometime.

446
00:42:01,437 --> 00:42:05,437
I forgot to introduce myself.
My name is Rodion Rachkov.

447
00:42:05,437 --> 00:42:08,437
It's a name you hardly hear
in Russia these days.

448
00:42:08,437 --> 00:42:12,437
Yes, when I was young,
foreign names were more common.

449
00:42:12,437 --> 00:42:15,437
Edward, Robert, Rudolph...

450
00:42:15,437 --> 00:42:19,437
The French delegation just called.
They'll be here in half an hour.

451
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:23,437
Thank you.

452
00:42:27,437 --> 00:42:31,437
Katerina?

453
00:42:33,437 --> 00:42:37,437
Have I changed all that much?

454
00:42:37,437 --> 00:42:41,437
No. It's just I'm surprised...

455
00:42:41,437 --> 00:42:45,437
So many years have passed...

456
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:49,437
I never thought you'd become
a director.

457
00:42:49,437 --> 00:42:52,437
I've only been a director
for three months.

458
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:56,437
Shall we begin?
I'm really very busy.

459
00:42:59,437 --> 00:43:03,437
All right, sure.

460
00:43:06,437 --> 00:43:09,437
We're ready to go here.

461
00:43:09,437 --> 00:43:11,437
Go ahead, please.

462
00:43:11,437 --> 00:43:15,437
Good afternoon, ladies and
gentlemen!

463
00:43:15,437 --> 00:43:19,437
The men in the audience are free
to do whatever they want to.

464
00:43:20,437 --> 00:43:24,437
Our products are primarily
of interest to women.

465
00:43:50,437 --> 00:43:53,437
When I think of what
I might've missed,

466
00:43:53,437 --> 00:43:57,437
if I had decided to sleep over
at Tonia's that night.

467
00:43:57,437 --> 00:44:01,437
Or if I had taken another train.

468
00:44:01,437 --> 00:44:05,437
I was thinking the same thing.

469
00:44:10,437 --> 00:44:14,437
How come you never did get
married?

470
00:44:14,437 --> 00:44:18,437
I was waiting for you.

471
00:44:18,437 --> 00:44:22,437
But there was a man in your life?

472
00:44:23,437 --> 00:44:27,437
Once...

473
00:44:27,437 --> 00:44:31,437
But now it seems like it happened
to someone else.

474
00:44:39,437 --> 00:44:43,437
Are there any snapshots of you
as a kid?

475
00:44:44,437 --> 00:44:46,437
Yeah, a couple.

476
00:44:46,437 --> 00:44:49,437
You must've been funny looking.

477
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:53,437
- You must show them to me later.
- Okay.

478
00:44:55,437 --> 00:44:59,437
- I warn you, I snore.
- So what?

479
00:45:01,437 --> 00:45:05,437
I'll whisper in your ear "shsh"
and you'll be quiet.

480
00:45:07,437 --> 00:45:11,437
There's another thing.
I can't stop tossing and turning.

481
00:45:15,437 --> 00:45:19,437
I'll take you in my arms
to make you stop.

482
00:45:19,437 --> 00:45:22,437
Good idea, let's try.

483
00:45:22,437 --> 00:45:25,437
Oh, my God! I didn't see
what time it was!

484
00:45:25,437 --> 00:45:27,437
Alexandra'll be home any minute!

485
00:45:27,437 --> 00:45:29,437
So early?

486
00:45:29,437 --> 00:45:33,437
Put the sheets in the closet!

487
00:45:34,437 --> 00:45:38,437
The pillows, too.

488
00:45:38,437 --> 00:45:42,437
- There're glasses in there.
- Put them in the bottom drawer.

489
00:45:42,437 --> 00:45:46,437
Who was the idiot
who invented this contraption?

490
00:46:00,437 --> 00:46:03,437
Why are you sitting in the dark?

491
00:46:03,437 --> 00:46:07,437
Cause we're watching television.

492
00:46:14,437 --> 00:46:18,437
Hello.

493
00:46:20,437 --> 00:46:24,437
So what? Would you please
stop bothering me!

494
00:46:28,437 --> 00:46:32,437
No! I have no desire to meet you.

495
00:46:35,437 --> 00:46:38,437
She's not your daughter.

496
00:46:38,437 --> 00:46:41,437
Born at the end of July, yes.

497
00:46:41,437 --> 00:46:44,437
You've been counting.

498
00:46:44,437 --> 00:46:48,437
May I come in?

499
00:46:53,437 --> 00:46:57,437
All right. We can meet
on Gogol Boulevard at 17:45.

500
00:46:58,437 --> 00:47:02,437
But not more than 15 minutes.
I'm really very busy.

501
00:47:29,437 --> 00:47:33,437
- Hello.
- How are you?

502
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:36,437
You're alone, not with your mother?

503
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:40,437
My mother died eight years ago.

504
00:47:40,437 --> 00:47:44,437
I'm sorry.

505
00:47:47,437 --> 00:47:51,437
Now what do you want?

506
00:47:51,437 --> 00:47:54,437
I want to see my daughter.

507
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:58,437
What for? You've been getting along
without her until now.

508
00:47:58,437 --> 00:48:00,437
Until now I didn't know
she existed.

509
00:48:00,437 --> 00:48:03,437
You didn't want to know you mean?

510
00:48:03,437 --> 00:48:06,437
You were never so cruel before.

511
00:48:06,437 --> 00:48:08,437
And guess who taught me that?

512
00:48:08,437 --> 00:48:12,437
As for me, I feel as if
a new life has started

513
00:48:14,437 --> 00:48:17,437
now that I know
I have a daughter.

514
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:21,437
A grown-up daughter to boot.
You don't have to look after her

515
00:48:21,437 --> 00:48:25,437
staying up at night,
to walk her to school...

516
00:48:25,437 --> 00:48:29,437
If I'm guilty of hurting you,

517
00:48:29,437 --> 00:48:33,437
I've been punished enough, so
there's no need to do it.

518
00:48:34,437 --> 00:48:38,437
Yes, I've led a useless life
all right.

519
00:48:39,437 --> 00:48:43,437
I've always pretended
it was just a rehearsal,

520
00:48:45,437 --> 00:48:47,437
that real life still lay
ahead.

521
00:48:47,437 --> 00:48:49,437
I've been married twice.

522
00:48:49,437 --> 00:48:53,437
My first wife ran out on me
and I left the second one.

523
00:48:53,437 --> 00:48:57,437
And now here I am, alone
with no kids, with no wife,

524
00:48:58,437 --> 00:49:02,437
not even anyone I can really
call a friend.

525
00:49:05,437 --> 00:49:09,437
How many times I've imagined
what it would be like meeting you.

526
00:49:09,437 --> 00:49:12,437
All the words I've so
carefully prepared.

527
00:49:12,437 --> 00:49:16,437
Now you're here and I don't
know what to say.

528
00:49:17,437 --> 00:49:21,437
For many years I didn't stop
loving you.

529
00:49:21,437 --> 00:49:24,437
But then I became hateful
and bitter.

530
00:49:24,437 --> 00:49:27,437
I wanted you to know
about my success,

531
00:49:27,437 --> 00:49:31,437
to make you see how wrong you were.

532
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:37,437
But now I think
that it was all to the good.

533
00:49:38,437 --> 00:49:42,437
I wouldn't have become a success
if you had stayed.

534
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:45,437
I'm glad that you didn't
marry me then,

535
00:49:45,437 --> 00:49:48,437
because in that case I wouldn't
have met a wonderful man

536
00:49:48,437 --> 00:49:52,437
whom I love now.

537
00:49:52,437 --> 00:49:56,437
Believe me, everything
will work out for the best.

538
00:49:56,437 --> 00:50:00,437
Life begins at 40.
It may sound trite, but it's true.

539
00:50:01,437 --> 00:50:05,437
Goodbye, and please
don't call me up anymore.

540
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:10,437
I want to see my daughter!

541
00:50:16,437 --> 00:50:19,437
No, you won't go there!
I'm going with you!

542
00:50:19,437 --> 00:50:23,437
- This is none of your business.
- This is my business!

543
00:50:24,437 --> 00:50:28,437
I'm gonna lock the door!

544
00:50:28,437 --> 00:50:32,437
I'm going with you!

545
00:50:32,437 --> 00:50:35,437
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

546
00:50:35,437 --> 00:50:39,437
You're right. It's getting late.
You can go there tomorrow.

547
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:44,437
Wait, I'm coming with you!
Let go of me!

548
00:50:44,437 --> 00:50:47,437
- What's going on?
- There's gonna be a fight.

549
00:50:47,437 --> 00:50:50,437
- What about?
- About me.

550
00:50:50,437 --> 00:50:52,437
All right, let's have the story.

551
00:50:52,437 --> 00:50:56,437
I used to go out
with Volodya Kopylov.

552
00:50:56,437 --> 00:50:58,437
Now I'm going with Nikita
and he loves me.

553
00:50:58,437 --> 00:51:01,437
I'm in love with him too.

554
00:51:01,437 --> 00:51:04,437
And Kopylov and his pals
are out to get him.

555
00:51:04,437 --> 00:51:07,437
They don't want him
to see me anymore.

556
00:51:07,437 --> 00:51:09,437
Nikita has bruises all over.

557
00:51:09,437 --> 00:51:13,437
That shows he really loves you.
Let's go and help him.

558
00:51:14,437 --> 00:51:18,437
I wanted to call the police,
but mother wouldn't let me.

559
00:51:19,437 --> 00:51:21,437
She said this is something
we should handle ourselves.

560
00:51:21,437 --> 00:51:25,437
- Right, that's the best way.
- There are five of them.

561
00:51:41,437 --> 00:51:45,437
- Thought it over?
- Yeah, you're punks.

562
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:50,437
- Who's a punk? Me?
- You! You're another punk!

563
00:51:50,437 --> 00:51:54,437
- And maybe he's a punk too?
- You're a bunch of punks!

564
00:51:54,437 --> 00:51:58,437
Take it easy, boys.
Five against one, is it?

565
00:52:02,437 --> 00:52:04,437
You know I don't think
I like those odds.

566
00:52:04,437 --> 00:52:08,437
I'd advise you to mind
your own business, pop!

567
00:52:08,437 --> 00:52:12,437
It's just that five against one
isn't my idea of a fair fight.

568
00:52:14,437 --> 00:52:17,437
I don't believe in beating up
ladies and sick old men,

569
00:52:17,437 --> 00:52:20,437
but I think I can make
an exception for you though.

570
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,437
That was just for practice.

571
00:52:22,437 --> 00:52:25,437
- Just a preventive measure.
- They read books.

572
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:28,437
He could've broken my arm, you know.

573
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:30,437
- Are you an expert in judo?
- That's right.

574
00:52:30,437 --> 00:52:33,437
Now get lost, pops!

575
00:52:33,437 --> 00:52:37,437
Why shouldn't we take
our friend over there with us?

576
00:52:44,437 --> 00:52:47,437
Well, bastard, I got the message!

577
00:52:47,437 --> 00:52:50,437
The evening's been quiet till now,
but things are gonna pick up.

578
00:52:50,437 --> 00:52:53,437
You want a taste of my boot, too?

579
00:52:53,437 --> 00:52:57,437
Oh, you tripped!

580
00:52:57,437 --> 00:53:01,437
Stay down!

581
00:53:38,437 --> 00:53:41,437
Now take it easy.

582
00:53:41,437 --> 00:53:45,437
Let me go! Don't bother me!

583
00:53:58,437 --> 00:54:01,437
We'd better be going.

584
00:54:01,437 --> 00:54:05,437
You dare lay a hand on him again
or even touch him...

585
00:54:11,437 --> 00:54:15,437
- Tough girl!
- You bet!

586
00:54:23,437 --> 00:54:26,437
- Are we gonna tell mother?
- No need to.

587
00:54:26,437 --> 00:54:30,437
Why not? I want her to know
what you've done.

588
00:54:31,437 --> 00:54:33,437
You acted like a real man.

589
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:36,437
Any man would do it.

590
00:54:36,437 --> 00:54:40,437
Making a decision and fight for it
is a man's duty.

591
00:54:40,437 --> 00:54:44,437
You wouldn't be proud of a woman
just because she can cook a meal?

592
00:54:46,437 --> 00:54:50,437
I don't know how to cook a meal.

593
00:54:51,437 --> 00:54:55,437
That's all right, I'll teach you.

594
00:54:55,437 --> 00:54:58,437
Why didn't you continue
your education?

595
00:54:58,437 --> 00:55:01,437
- What for?
- To become an executive.

596
00:55:01,437 --> 00:55:04,437
Should everyone
be an executive?

597
00:55:04,437 --> 00:55:07,437
No, not at all,
but everyone wants to.

598
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:11,437
Ever hear of the Roman emperor
Diocletian?

599
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:16,437
At the very height of his empire,

600
00:55:16,437 --> 00:55:20,437
he just gave away the crown and
settled down somewhere in the country.

601
00:55:20,437 --> 00:55:24,437
And when he was asked to take over
again, he said:

602
00:55:25,437 --> 00:55:29,437
"Once you've seen the cabbages
that I've grown,

603
00:55:29,437 --> 00:55:33,437
you'll stop asking me."

604
00:55:33,437 --> 00:55:36,437
- He never went back?
- No.

605
00:55:36,437 --> 00:55:39,437
You see, not everybody wants
to be some kind of leader.

606
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:43,437
Although it seems to be the only
case in the history of the world.

607
00:55:45,437 --> 00:55:49,437
So you'd rather grow cabbages?

608
00:55:49,437 --> 00:55:53,437
I prefer doing the things
I like doing.

609
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:57,437
I don't care a damn about prestige
or stupid fashion.

610
00:55:58,437 --> 00:56:01,437
I love the kind of work I do

611
00:56:01,437 --> 00:56:05,437
because I know that I'm needed.

612
00:56:05,437 --> 00:56:07,437
I love my friends,

613
00:56:07,437 --> 00:56:11,437
because we never get tired of
each other, of our talks.

614
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:17,437
I love your mother because...
because I love her.

615
00:56:18,437 --> 00:56:22,437
- Why are you laughing?
- It's fun talking to you.

616
00:56:22,437 --> 00:56:26,437
You think you're as happy
as any man could be?

617
00:56:26,437 --> 00:56:28,437
No, not really.

618
00:56:28,437 --> 00:56:31,437
If I could get
a glass of cold soda now,

619
00:56:31,437 --> 00:56:35,437
then I'd consider myself
absolutely happy.

620
00:56:41,437 --> 00:56:44,437
- You shouldn't have done it.
- Done what?

621
00:56:44,437 --> 00:56:48,437
I told her everything.
I couldn't help it.

622
00:56:48,437 --> 00:56:52,437
Using your fists is no way
to settle problems.

623
00:56:52,437 --> 00:56:56,437
- And if they don't understand words?
- Then you didn't explain properly.

624
00:56:59,437 --> 00:57:01,437
And you, a grown-up man, should've
known better than that.

625
00:57:01,437 --> 00:57:05,437
Now these boys are going to believe
that might makes right.

626
00:57:05,437 --> 00:57:09,437
They'll learn that using violence
they should expect violence in return.

627
00:57:11,437 --> 00:57:14,437
I want you to promise me

628
00:57:14,437 --> 00:57:18,437
you'll never do anything like this
without my permission.

629
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,437
Yes, ma'am...

630
00:57:22,437 --> 00:57:26,437
But I want you to respect my wishes
as well.

631
00:57:27,437 --> 00:57:31,437
If you talk to me in that manner
once more,

632
00:57:34,437 --> 00:57:38,437
I will never set foot
in this house again.

633
00:57:38,437 --> 00:57:42,437
As for the decisions in this house,
I'll be making them.

634
00:57:42,437 --> 00:57:46,437
For the simple reason
that I'm the man here.

635
00:57:48,437 --> 00:57:52,437
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

636
00:57:55,437 --> 00:57:59,437
Alexandra, one of your friends.

637
00:58:00,437 --> 00:58:04,437
Please never raise your voice
to me like that.

638
00:58:06,437 --> 00:58:09,437
I was so afraid you'd get hurt.
I'm sorry.

639
00:58:09,437 --> 00:58:12,437
You want to see mother?

640
00:58:12,437 --> 00:58:15,437
So you're Alexandra?

641
00:58:15,437 --> 00:58:19,437
Please come in.

642
00:58:19,437 --> 00:58:23,437
- Will you join us?
- Well, thank you.

643
00:58:23,437 --> 00:58:26,437
Alexandra, would you mind?

644
00:58:26,437 --> 00:58:30,437
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

645
00:58:38,437 --> 00:58:40,437
Are you going to introduce me

646
00:58:40,437 --> 00:58:44,437
or should I do it myself?

647
00:58:45,437 --> 00:58:48,437
Meet Rodion Rachkov,
he's a television cameraman.

648
00:58:48,437 --> 00:58:50,437
An old friend of mine.

649
00:58:50,437 --> 00:58:53,437
So old that he didn't even
recognize me when he saw me.

650
00:58:53,437 --> 00:58:57,437
- Georgy and Alexandra.
- It's a pleasure. Sit down, please.

651
00:58:58,437 --> 00:59:02,437
- Would you like some cognac?
- I won't say no.

652
00:59:02,437 --> 00:59:06,437
There you go.

653
00:59:13,437 --> 00:59:17,437
I think I have some lemon around.

654
00:59:17,437 --> 00:59:19,437
Well, what did you think of the show?

655
00:59:19,437 --> 00:59:22,437
Mom looked a little nervous.

656
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:24,437
- You were on TV?
- Oh, who cares?

657
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:28,437
You made quite an impression
with our bigwigs.

658
00:59:28,437 --> 00:59:32,437
They saw in you a real leader
of today.

659
00:59:32,437 --> 00:59:35,437
There're plans to make a film
about you.

660
00:59:35,437 --> 00:59:38,437
About a woman who has made herself,

661
00:59:38,437 --> 00:59:41,437
coming all the way from a common
worker to a factory director.

662
00:59:41,437 --> 00:59:44,437
- Who's the director?
- Let's have a drink...

663
00:59:44,437 --> 00:59:48,437
What d'you mean? Katerina, of course.

664
00:59:52,437 --> 00:59:56,437
Oh yes, sure...

665
00:59:58,437 --> 01:00:02,437
How long have you been working
at television?

666
01:00:04,437 --> 01:00:06,437
It will be twenty-five years soon.

667
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:08,437
So you were at the very beginning?

668
01:00:08,437 --> 01:00:11,437
Even then I knew

669
01:00:11,437 --> 01:00:15,437
that television was
the future of mankind.

670
01:00:16,437 --> 01:00:19,437
- I wanted to explain...
- I understand...

671
01:00:19,437 --> 01:00:23,437
It would change our life.

672
01:00:23,437 --> 01:00:26,437
There will be no books, no newspapers,
no theatre, no movies.

673
01:00:26,437 --> 01:00:30,437
- What will remain?
- Only television.

674
01:00:31,437 --> 01:00:35,437
- That's some misunderstanding.
- I understand.

675
01:00:35,437 --> 01:00:37,437
I can agree about the movies.

676
01:00:37,437 --> 01:00:40,437
But theatre...
This is a special art.

677
01:00:40,437 --> 01:00:43,437
Let's talk about it
in another twenty years.

678
01:00:43,437 --> 01:00:47,437
In twenty years the world will be
nothing like today.

679
01:00:47,437 --> 01:00:50,437
- Have you ever visited the studios?
- No, never.

680
01:00:50,437 --> 01:00:54,437
I can arrange it if you want.

681
01:00:54,437 --> 01:00:58,437
I think I'll go now.

682
01:00:58,437 --> 01:01:01,437
I'm pretty tired. I think
I'll get to bed early.

683
01:01:01,437 --> 01:01:04,437
Don't go. I want to talk to you.

684
01:01:04,437 --> 01:01:07,437
We'll talk tomorrow.
I better go.

685
01:01:07,437 --> 01:01:09,437
I won't let you leave here!

686
01:01:09,437 --> 01:01:13,437
She's in a very bad mood today.

687
01:01:26,437 --> 01:01:30,437
He won't ever come back.

688
01:01:34,437 --> 01:01:37,437
I'll never see him again!

689
01:01:37,437 --> 01:01:41,437
Damn you. Why did you have to do
this to me again?

690
01:01:42,437 --> 01:01:46,437
What did I do now?

691
01:01:46,437 --> 01:01:50,437
- Do you know who this man is?
- Rodion Rachkov.

692
01:01:50,437 --> 01:01:54,437
- He's your father.
- My father's dead!

693
01:01:54,437 --> 01:01:58,437
As you can see, he's very much alive
and pretty well.

694
01:02:36,437 --> 01:02:39,437
Don't cry. You know
what Moscow thinks of tears.

695
01:02:39,437 --> 01:02:43,437
We shouldn't be sitting around,
we should do something!

696
01:02:46,437 --> 01:02:49,437
How long has it been
since he disappeared?

697
01:02:49,437 --> 01:02:50,437
A week.

698
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:54,437
Why don't you swallow your pride
and go see him yourself?

699
01:02:55,437 --> 01:02:59,437
Oh, what pride. I would go to
the ends of the earth...

700
01:03:01,437 --> 01:03:03,437
We don't know where he lives.

701
01:03:03,437 --> 01:03:07,437
Look in the phone book, that's all.
What was his last name again?

702
01:03:09,437 --> 01:03:13,437
I don't know.

703
01:03:13,437 --> 01:03:15,437
A good start.

704
01:03:15,437 --> 01:03:19,437
You didn't... Is anything gone
from the apartment?

705
01:03:21,437 --> 01:03:22,437
What do you mean?

706
01:03:22,437 --> 01:03:26,437
All right, I'll find him.
A tool and die maker, you say?

707
01:03:26,437 --> 01:03:29,437
Yeah, he works in some sort of
institute.

708
01:03:29,437 --> 01:03:33,437
Does he have any particular marks
I can look for?

709
01:03:34,437 --> 01:03:38,437
A scar, for instance?

710
01:03:38,437 --> 01:03:40,437
Not that I know of.

711
01:03:40,437 --> 01:03:44,437
They took out his appendix.

712
01:03:45,437 --> 01:03:47,437
That's not what I meant.

713
01:03:47,437 --> 01:03:49,437
Wait for me here.

714
01:03:49,437 --> 01:03:53,437
Let everyone in and no one out.

715
01:03:53,437 --> 01:03:57,437
If need be, shoot first
and ask questions afterwards!

716
01:04:00,437 --> 01:04:03,437
Is there a Georgy living here?

717
01:04:03,437 --> 01:04:07,437
Alias Goga, alias Gosha,
or Yuri or Jora?

718
01:04:08,437 --> 01:04:12,437
There's only a man named Georgy
living here. Right in there.

719
01:04:19,437 --> 01:04:23,437
- Is he in there?
- I don't know.

720
01:04:24,437 --> 01:04:25,437
He's there all right.

721
01:04:25,437 --> 01:04:29,437
You'll have to go around.
They're redoing the walls.

722
01:04:32,437 --> 01:04:36,437
To the right. And to the right again.

723
01:05:34,437 --> 01:05:38,437
- Gosha.
- Nikolai.

724
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:43,437
Has it been raining hard?

725
01:05:43,437 --> 01:05:47,437
For three days now.

726
01:05:47,437 --> 01:05:51,437
What's going on in the world?

727
01:05:53,437 --> 01:05:57,437
Another airplane was hijacked.

728
01:06:01,437 --> 01:06:05,437
What's wrong with you?

729
01:06:05,437 --> 01:06:09,437
Katia, you don't know how lucky
you really are!

730
01:06:10,437 --> 01:06:14,437
You often said that at our age
it's impossible to fall in love.

731
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:17,437
Because a man's faults come out.

732
01:06:17,437 --> 01:06:21,437
Yes, but he doesn't have any faults.

733
01:06:21,437 --> 01:06:25,437
He's the most perfect man
in the whole world!

734
01:06:32,437 --> 01:06:36,437
How did you expect her to tell you
that she made more money than you?

735
01:06:37,437 --> 01:06:40,437
She lied to me!

736
01:06:40,437 --> 01:06:41,437
That was just a misunderstanding.

737
01:06:41,437 --> 01:06:45,437
No, that's the matter of principle.

738
01:06:46,437 --> 01:06:49,437
Her big problem is

739
01:06:49,437 --> 01:06:52,437
that a man's social standing
is more important for her

740
01:06:52,437 --> 01:06:56,437
than his, that is, my personal
standing!

741
01:06:57,437 --> 01:07:01,437
Translate it.

742
01:07:13,437 --> 01:07:17,437
- Look...
- Some more vodka?

743
01:07:17,437 --> 01:07:21,437
No!

744
01:07:26,437 --> 01:07:30,437
Go and see who it is.

745
01:07:43,437 --> 01:07:47,437
I told you that I'd bring him here.
And that's what I've done.

746
01:07:47,437 --> 01:07:51,437
Who brought who over here
isn't very sure.

747
01:07:53,437 --> 01:07:57,437
- Where is she?
- In there.

748
01:08:42,437 --> 01:08:46,437
Eat some more.

749
01:08:46,437 --> 01:08:50,437
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

750
01:08:50,437 --> 01:08:54,437
- Gosha.
- I'm Antonina.

751
01:08:54,437 --> 01:08:58,437
Sit down, please.

752
01:09:02,437 --> 01:09:06,437
It's about time we were going...

753
01:09:17,437 --> 01:09:21,437
I propose that we all get together
at least once a week.

754
01:09:21,437 --> 01:09:25,437
From now on it's like
we're in the same family.

755
01:09:25,437 --> 01:09:29,437
That's an original way
of putting it.

756
01:09:42,437 --> 01:09:45,437
- Have you got dinner ready?
- Sure.

757
01:09:45,437 --> 01:09:49,437
Let's eat.
I'm very hungry.

758
01:10:29,437 --> 01:10:32,437
What's wrong?

759
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:36,437
It's been such a long time!

760
01:10:42,437 --> 01:10:46,437
Eight days.

761
01:10:49,437 --> 01:10:53,437
No. I looked for you a long time!

762
01:11:11,437 --> 01:11:15,437
Not everything works out right away,

763
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:18,437
And Moscow was built not in one day.

764
01:11:18,437 --> 01:11:22,437
It never took your word for it,

765
01:11:22,437 --> 01:11:26,437
It only believed in love.

766
01:11:26,437 --> 01:11:30,437
Whether covered with soft snow,

767
01:11:30,437 --> 01:11:33,437
Or glistening in autumn glow,

768
01:11:33,437 --> 01:11:37,437
It will warm a Ionely soul

769
01:11:37,437 --> 01:11:41,437
And nurture a tree in a grove...

770
01:11:50,437 --> 01:11:54,437
Vera ALENTOVA as Katerina

771
01:11:54,437 --> 01:11:57,437
