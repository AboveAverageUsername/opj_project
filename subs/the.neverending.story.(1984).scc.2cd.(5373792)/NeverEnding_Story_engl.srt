3
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:35,063
Good morning, Bastian.

4
00:02:55,187 --> 00:02:59,021
l had another dream, Dad, about Mom.

5
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:05,089
l understand, son.

6
00:03:06,998 --> 00:03:09,489
But we have to get on with things, right?

7
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:25,076
Bastian, we each have responsibilities.

8
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:28,882
We can't let Mom's death...

9
00:03:29,955 --> 00:03:32,890
...be an excuse
for not getting the job done, right?

10
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:35,048
Yes.

11
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:53,600
Son, it's time you and l had a talk.

12
00:03:57,783 --> 00:04:00,843
l got a call from your math teacher
yesterday.

13
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:06,485
She says that you were...

14
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:09,055
...drawing horses in your math book.

15
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:11,852
Unicorns. They were unicorns.

16
00:04:12,497 --> 00:04:13,395
What?

17
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:16,631
Nothing.

18
00:04:16,802 --> 00:04:20,135
She also says you don't
do your homework on time.

19
00:04:24,342 --> 00:04:27,573
l'm very disappointed you didn't even
try out for the swimming team.

20
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:32,642
As to those riding lessons you wanted....

21
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:37,849
You say you love horses
but you're afraid to get on a real one.

22
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:43,918
You're old enough to get your head down
out of the clouds and...

23
00:04:44,863 --> 00:04:47,195
...and keep both feet on the ground.

24
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:51,528
Okay.

25
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:03,741
Stop daydreaming.
Start facing your problems. Okay?

26
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,581
There, l think we've had a nice talk.

27
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:15,450
We should have more.

28
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:18,519
Have a good day, son.
Don't be late for school again.

29
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:21,355
But, yesterday l wasn't.

30
00:05:26,872 --> 00:05:29,204
Hey, it's the weirdo.

31
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:33,367
Weirdo, you got any cash for us today?

32
00:05:38,717 --> 00:05:40,514
Let's get him !

33
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:51,562
You can't get away.

34
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:53,728
You're dead, chicken!

35
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:55,060
We'll get you!

36
00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:00,564
-Where's your money?
-l don't have any!

37
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,039
No money? Mamma's boy is holding out.

38
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:06,906
lf you ain't got money,
you go in the garbage.

39
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,487
Maybe the chicken can lay an egg in there.

40
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:28,261
Who said you could get out of the garbage?

41
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,096
Get back in there.

42
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:31,533
Not again.

43
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,562
Not again!

44
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:35,469
Where are you going, wimp?

45
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,850
-He went that way.
-Which way?

46
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,982
Get out of here! l don't like kids.

47
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:13,409
Are you still here? Didn't you hear me?

48
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,446
You're hiding, aren't you?

49
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:18,546
The video arcade is down the street.

50
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:23,685
Here we just sell small rectangular objects.
They're called books.

51
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:27,291
They require effort and make no beeps.

52
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,348
On your way.

53
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:32,294
l know books. l have 186 of them at home.

54
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:33,855
Comic books.

55
00:07:33,932 --> 00:07:35,763
No, l've read Treasure lsland...

56
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:38,232
... The Last ofthe Mohicans, Wizard ofOz...

57
00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:41,272
...Lord ofthe Rings,
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Tarzan.

58
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:48,002
Who are you running away from?

59
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:54,378
Some kids from school.

60
00:07:55,286 --> 00:07:56,150
Why?

61
00:07:57,489 --> 00:07:59,354
They threw me in the garbage.

62
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:01,582
Why not punch them in the nose?

63
00:08:04,896 --> 00:08:06,386
l don't know.

64
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:14,395
What's that book about?

65
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,103
Oh, this is something special.

66
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:27,408
Well, what is it?

67
00:08:30,255 --> 00:08:31,153
Look.

68
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:35,086
Your books are safe.

69
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:38,259
While you're reading them...

70
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:43,367
...you get to become
Tarzan or Robinson Crusoe.

71
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:45,596
But that's what l like about them.

72
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,604
But afterwards you get to be
a little boy again.

73
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:51,932
What do you mean?

74
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:53,604
Listen.

75
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:57,805
Have you ever been...

76
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,282
...Captain Nemo...

77
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:06,079
...trapped inside your submarine
while the giant squid is attacking you?

78
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:09,556
Yes.

79
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:12,285
Weren't you afraid you couldn't escape?

80
00:09:12,964 --> 00:09:14,556
But it's only a story.

81
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,290
That's what l'm talking about.

82
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:19,800
The ones you read...

83
00:09:20,138 --> 00:09:21,298
...are safe.

84
00:09:24,642 --> 00:09:26,132
And that one isn't?

85
00:09:28,646 --> 00:09:30,170
Don't worry about it.

86
00:09:30,315 --> 00:09:32,806
But you just said it was--

87
00:09:40,758 --> 00:09:42,419
Forget about it.

88
00:09:43,128 --> 00:09:46,325
This book is not for you.

89
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,530
Koreander's.

90
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:01,635
What can l do for you?

91
00:10:09,554 --> 00:10:11,886
They run maybe 300, 370....

92
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:14,422
lt will take me a couple of a weeks.

93
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:10,578
Math test. Oh, no!

94
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:17,575
''lt was midnight in the Howling Forest.

95
00:12:17,915 --> 00:12:22,079
''The wind whistled
through the tops ofthe ancient trees.

96
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,752
''Suddenly, something enormous...

97
00:12:24,956 --> 00:12:28,790
''...crashedandrumbled
through the eerie woods. ''

98
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:55,846
What's that?

99
00:13:31,989 --> 00:13:33,581
Excuse me...

100
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:38,018
...but would it be all right
if l joined you this evening?

101
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:44,665
You see, l've been traveling all day.

102
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:13,963
Now l see why you picked this camp.

103
00:14:25,543 --> 00:14:29,035
A delicious looking limestone rock!

104
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:34,617
Nice bouquet.

105
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:38,950
Must be a real vintage year.

106
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:42,983
Yes, you're right.

107
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:46,488
Those delicious rocks
are the reason we've camped here.

108
00:14:48,332 --> 00:14:51,927
-ls he a nutcase?
-No, he's a Rock Biter.

109
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:53,364
A Rock Biter!

110
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:11,519
-Sorry.
-Poor baby.

111
00:15:15,993 --> 00:15:17,517
Pardon me.

112
00:15:18,963 --> 00:15:23,161
That was limestone, with a dash of quartz.

113
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:26,631
Very tasty.

114
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:32,675
Where l come from in the North,
we us to have exquisite gourmet rocks.

115
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,678
Only now...

116
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:38,979
...now...

117
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:42,210
...they're all gone.

118
00:15:42,987 --> 00:15:45,148
l know how it happened.

119
00:15:45,823 --> 00:15:48,314
l swear it wasn't me.

120
00:15:50,461 --> 00:15:52,895
l think l know what it was. Tell us more.

121
00:15:52,964 --> 00:15:57,264
Near my home,
there used to be a beautiful lake...

122
00:15:58,102 --> 00:15:59,433
...but then...

123
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:02,837
...then it was gone.

124
00:16:03,274 --> 00:16:05,139
Did the lake dry up?

125
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:08,540
No. lt just wasn't there anymore.

126
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:13,477
Nothing was there anymore.
Not even a dried-up lake.

127
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:15,250
A hole?

128
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:19,483
A hole would be something.
No, it was Nothing.

129
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:23,849
And it got bigger and bigger.

130
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:27,692
First, there was no lake anymore.

131
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:31,496
And then, finally, no rocks.

132
00:16:37,675 --> 00:16:42,271
lf he keeps stuffing his face like that,
soon there won't be any rocks here either.

133
00:16:43,314 --> 00:16:45,782
Night Hob, this could be serious!

134
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:47,712
Rock Biter...

135
00:16:47,785 --> 00:16:50,948
...what you told us is also happening
where l live in the West.

136
00:16:51,022 --> 00:16:54,116
A strange sort of Nothing
is destroying everything.

137
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:58,628
Yes. We Night Hobs live in the South
and it's there, too.

138
00:16:58,996 --> 00:17:04,832
So, it's not just in our part of Fantasia?

139
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,829
Maybe, it's already everywhere.

140
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:19,545
Maybe our whole land is in danger.

141
00:17:20,585 --> 00:17:21,916
What can we do?

142
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:26,952
My people are sending me to
the lvory Tower, to the Empress, for help.

143
00:17:27,124 --> 00:17:28,785
We are on the same--

144
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,224
We are on the same mission.
After all, if the Empress can't save us...

145
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:35,793
...who could?

146
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,391
Then why are we all just sitting here...

147
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:41,667
...instead of taking off for the lvory Tower?

148
00:17:42,306 --> 00:17:43,967
What are we waiting for?

149
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,339
Yes. Let's go now.

150
00:17:46,444 --> 00:17:47,877
Wake up!

151
00:17:48,112 --> 00:17:49,511
Come on, old girl.

152
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,571
We can't just hang around here.

153
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,484
Wake up! Ready for takeoff.

154
00:17:54,752 --> 00:17:56,686
Oh, stupid bat!

155
00:17:57,254 --> 00:18:01,213
We can't wait for a snail. Can l carry you?

156
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:04,659
Don't worry. lt's a racing snail.

157
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:09,559
But we can't even wait for a racing snail.

158
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,202
lt really is a racing snail.

159
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:18,669
Nobody gives a hoot
about me and my stupid bat.

160
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,788
Maybe l'll take a few of these
yummy gourmet rocks, for the road....

161
00:18:59,684 --> 00:19:00,912
The Nothing!

162
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:18,424
Look!

163
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,531
There it is!

164
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:24,968
The heart of Fantasia !

165
00:19:45,663 --> 00:19:49,622
l never knew it was that beautiful.

166
00:20:03,748 --> 00:20:04,874
Stay awake!

167
00:20:07,151 --> 00:20:09,142
l told you to stay awake.

168
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:58,899
The home of the Empress.

169
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,562
She's our only hope.

170
00:21:35,372 --> 00:21:38,603
Friends, l know why you are all here.

171
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,341
The Nothing...

172
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:46,242
...is destroying our world.

173
00:21:48,686 --> 00:21:51,018
l also know that you...

174
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:53,854
...have come to beseech...

175
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:56,856
...the Empress for help.

176
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:03,223
But l have terrible news.

177
00:22:06,537 --> 00:22:08,732
The Empress herself
has become deathly ill.

178
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:16,878
There seems to be a mysterious link
between her illness and the Nothing.

179
00:22:19,483 --> 00:22:21,144
She's dying.

180
00:22:25,823 --> 00:22:29,554
So, she cannot save us.

181
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,891
But there just might be one chance.

182
00:22:39,403 --> 00:22:42,566
The Plains People
who hunt the purple buffalo...

183
00:22:42,907 --> 00:22:45,068
...have among them a great warrior.

184
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:49,573
He alone has a chance
to fight the Nothing and save us.

185
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:53,273
He is our only hope.

186
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,980
His name is Atreyu.

187
00:23:18,442 --> 00:23:20,103
Atreyu.

188
00:23:30,154 --> 00:23:33,555
''The Empress hadalready
sent for the great warrior.

189
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:38,224
''When he finally appeared
on the terrace ofthe lvory Tower...

190
00:23:38,963 --> 00:23:42,956
''...he carried with him
the hopes ofall Fantasia. ''

191
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,211
A little boy!

192
00:24:03,187 --> 00:24:07,021
l'm sorry, but this is not
the time nor place for children.

193
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:09,654
You must leave.

194
00:24:09,994 --> 00:24:12,986
lf you don't want me here,
you shouldn't have sent for me.

195
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:17,331
ls he a nutcase?

196
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:20,097
lt was not you we sent for.
We wanted Atreyu.

197
00:24:20,771 --> 00:24:22,261
l am Atreyu.

198
00:24:24,341 --> 00:24:26,332
Not Atreyu the Child.

199
00:24:26,677 --> 00:24:28,304
Atreyu the Warrior.

200
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:31,041
l am the only Atreyu of the Plains People.

201
00:24:31,382 --> 00:24:34,317
But l'll be happy to go back
to hunting the purple buffalo.

202
00:24:36,286 --> 00:24:37,184
Wait!

203
00:24:41,358 --> 00:24:43,019
Come back, please.

204
00:24:54,204 --> 00:24:57,367
lf you really are the Atreyu we sent for...

205
00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:00,370
...you would be willing to go on a quest?

206
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:04,377
Yes, of course.

207
00:25:05,516 --> 00:25:07,177
What kind of a quest?

208
00:25:07,451 --> 00:25:09,942
To find a cure for the Empress...

209
00:25:12,222 --> 00:25:14,213
...and to save our world.

210
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:18,790
No one can give you any advice
except this:

211
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:22,459
You must go alone.

212
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,191
You must leave all your weapons behind.

213
00:25:28,972 --> 00:25:30,906
lt will be very dangerous.

214
00:25:32,743 --> 00:25:34,370
Any chance of success?

215
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,742
l do not know.

216
00:25:38,382 --> 00:25:40,043
But if you fail...

217
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:43,075
...the Empress will surely die...

218
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,387
...and our whole world will be destroyed.

219
00:26:07,444 --> 00:26:08,536
When do l begin?

220
00:26:10,948 --> 00:26:13,781
Now. And you must hurry, Atreyu.

221
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:16,316
The Nothing grows stronger every day.

222
00:26:22,926 --> 00:26:24,120
Take this.

223
00:26:33,337 --> 00:26:34,668
The Auryn!

224
00:26:40,944 --> 00:26:45,278
He who wears the Auryn
speaks for the Empress.

225
00:26:45,883 --> 00:26:48,875
lt will guide and protect you.

226
00:27:01,932 --> 00:27:03,058
Wake up.

227
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:04,825
Farewell, Atreyu.

228
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,831
Take care.

229
00:27:45,475 --> 00:27:47,033
''At the same time...

230
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:51,137
''...elsewhere in Fantasia,
a Creature ofDarkness...

231
00:27:51,615 --> 00:27:54,106
''...also began his quest. ''

232
00:28:15,939 --> 00:28:19,932
''They hadbeen traveling aimlessly
for almost a week...

233
00:28:20,377 --> 00:28:23,437
''...but they couldnot finda cure
for the Empress.

234
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,344
''NeitherAtreyu nor his horse, Artax,
had the vaguest suspicion...

235
00:28:28,785 --> 00:28:32,118
''...that the Creature ofDarkness,
the Gmork...

236
00:28:32,522 --> 00:28:35,184
''...was already tracking them down. ''

237
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:46,125
What is it, Artax?

238
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:50,501
ls it time to go already?

239
00:28:52,976 --> 00:28:56,309
l know what you want. lt's time to eat.

240
00:29:00,717 --> 00:29:01,809
Good idea.

241
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:04,349
No, it's a great idea !

242
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:26,641
No, not too much.

243
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:30,503
We still have a long way to go.

244
00:30:34,077 --> 00:30:38,070
''A treyu andArtax had searched
the Silver Mountains...

245
00:30:38,248 --> 00:30:41,581
''...the Desert ofShatteredHopes
and the Crystal Towers...

246
00:30:42,185 --> 00:30:43,812
''...without success.

247
00:30:44,388 --> 00:30:47,380
''And so, there was only one chance left.

248
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:50,855
''To findMorla, the Ancient One...

249
00:30:51,428 --> 00:30:53,760
''...the wisest being in Fantasia...

''...whose home was the ShellMountain...

251
00:30:56,867 --> 00:31:01,429
''...somewhere in the deadly
Swamps ofSadness. ''

252
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:12,942
Come on, boy. Come on.

253
00:31:26,129 --> 00:31:27,221
That's it.

254
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:33,162
lt's okay.

255
00:31:34,137 --> 00:31:37,800
''Everyone knew that
whoever let the sadness overtake him...

256
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,468
''...would sink into the swamp. ''

257
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:42,540
You're doing fine, Artax.

258
00:31:57,928 --> 00:31:59,555
Come on, Artax.

259
00:32:05,268 --> 00:32:06,667
What's the matter?

260
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:09,270
What's wrong?

261
00:32:15,512 --> 00:32:16,809
Come on, boy.

262
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:20,982
What's the matter?

263
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:24,218
l understand.

264
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:30,656
lt's too difficult for you.

265
00:32:34,698 --> 00:32:37,496
Artax, you're sinking! Come on!

266
00:32:37,634 --> 00:32:40,432
Turn around! You have to! Now!

267
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:47,970
Fight against the sadness.

268
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,573
Artax, please.

269
00:32:52,883 --> 00:32:55,545
Don't let the sadness
of the swamps get to you.

270
00:32:56,052 --> 00:32:59,385
You have to try. You have to care.

271
00:33:00,056 --> 00:33:01,956
For me.

272
00:33:02,025 --> 00:33:04,585
You're my friend. l love you.

273
00:33:08,932 --> 00:33:11,162
Artax, stupid horse.

274
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:14,200
You got to move or you'll die.

275
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:16,505
Move. Please.

276
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:19,705
l won't give up. Don't quit.

277
00:33:19,776 --> 00:33:21,175
Artax!

278
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,501
The Shell Mountain.

279
00:35:01,845 --> 00:35:04,507
Morla, the Ancient One.

280
00:35:48,725 --> 00:35:49,885
Morla.

281
00:36:55,892 --> 00:37:00,386
But that's impossible.
They couldn't have heard me.

282
00:37:01,464 --> 00:37:04,092
Are you Morla, the Ancient One?

283
00:37:09,806 --> 00:37:14,834
Not that it matters, but yes.

284
00:37:15,145 --> 00:37:18,444
Please help me. Do you recognize this?

285
00:37:19,315 --> 00:37:20,646
Well...

286
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:23,916
...we haven't seen...

287
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:28,013
...the Auryn in a long time.

288
00:37:28,892 --> 00:37:29,722
We?

289
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:33,925
ls there someone else here, too?

290
00:37:33,997 --> 00:37:38,764
We haven't spoken to anyone else...

291
00:37:38,835 --> 00:37:42,498
...for thousands of years.

292
00:37:43,006 --> 00:37:46,703
So we started talking...

293
00:37:46,776 --> 00:37:48,767
...to ourselves.

294
00:38:01,257 --> 00:38:03,487
Morla, l bring terrible news.

295
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,894
Did you know the Empress is ill?

296
00:38:05,962 --> 00:38:09,898
Not that it matters, but yes.

297
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:13,525
Actually, we don't care.

298
00:38:13,703 --> 00:38:15,603
lf l don't save her, she'll die.

299
00:38:15,772 --> 00:38:18,400
There's a terrible Nothing
sweeping over the land.

300
00:38:18,474 --> 00:38:19,805
Don't you care?

301
00:38:20,043 --> 00:38:22,375
We don't even care...

302
00:38:23,313 --> 00:38:26,373
...whether or not we care.

303
00:38:33,456 --> 00:38:34,787
Do you have a cold?

304
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:39,192
No. We're allergic...

305
00:38:40,096 --> 00:38:41,654
...to youth.

306
00:38:46,035 --> 00:38:48,196
You know how to help the Empress,
don't you?

307
00:38:48,271 --> 00:38:50,796
Not that it matters...

308
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:53,802
...but yes.

309
00:38:53,877 --> 00:38:58,075
lf you don't tell me and the Nothing
keeps coming, you'll die too. Both of you.

310
00:38:58,748 --> 00:39:00,409
Die?

311
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,813
That, at least, would be something.

312
00:39:16,332 --> 00:39:18,926
Please help me.
You said you knew the answer.

313
00:39:20,003 --> 00:39:23,029
We're tired of sneezing.

314
00:39:23,106 --> 00:39:26,872
Go away! Nothing matters.

315
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:31,312
That's not true.
lf it didn't matter to you, you could tell me.

316
00:39:34,918 --> 00:39:36,408
Clever boy.

317
00:39:36,586 --> 00:39:37,951
Tell me, please.

318
00:39:38,621 --> 00:39:40,612
We don't know.

319
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:44,351
But you can ask...

320
00:39:44,627 --> 00:39:46,891
...the Southern Oracle.

321
00:39:46,996 --> 00:39:48,395
How can l get there?

322
00:39:48,464 --> 00:39:50,125
You can't.

323
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:56,361
lt's 10,000 miles away.

324
00:39:59,742 --> 00:40:01,733
But that's so far.

325
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:03,606
That's right.

326
00:40:04,447 --> 00:40:06,711
Forget it.

327
00:40:08,484 --> 00:40:10,076
Give up.

328
00:41:41,077 --> 00:41:42,237
No.

329
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,341
Atreyu wouldn't quit now.

330
00:43:22,812 --> 00:43:24,302
Oh, boy!

331
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:37,684
''After days andnights
ofunconsciousness...

332
00:43:37,927 --> 00:43:40,862
''...Atreyu slowly openedhis eyes...

333
00:43:41,631 --> 00:43:45,533
''...and foundhimself
in strange surroundings.

334
00:43:46,302 --> 00:43:49,294
''He was clean and
his wounds were dressed. ''

335
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:50,299
Leaving so soon?

336
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:00,375
l was just going to....

337
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:02,505
l have to....

338
00:45:02,912 --> 00:45:04,937
-l was trying to--
-Sneak away?

339
00:45:05,014 --> 00:45:07,482
Yes. l mean, no.

340
00:45:07,683 --> 00:45:09,344
l like children.

341
00:45:10,186 --> 00:45:11,448
For breakfast?

342
00:45:13,089 --> 00:45:16,490
Never. l'm a luck dragon.

343
00:45:17,126 --> 00:45:19,117
My name is Falkor.

344
00:45:20,129 --> 00:45:24,156
-And my name is--
-Atreyu. And you're on a quest.

345
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,664
How did you know that?

346
00:45:25,735 --> 00:45:27,396
You were unconscious.

347
00:45:28,271 --> 00:45:30,034
You talked in your sleep.

348
00:45:33,009 --> 00:45:35,409
Could you get around...

349
00:45:36,312 --> 00:45:39,679
...and scratch behind my right ear?

350
00:45:40,516 --> 00:45:43,679
l can never quite reach it.

351
00:45:49,792 --> 00:45:50,690
Here?

352
00:46:01,737 --> 00:46:04,069
That's so good.

353
00:46:05,241 --> 00:46:06,367
Thank you.

354
00:46:09,111 --> 00:46:13,980
So, little fellow, you're on your way
to the Southern Oracle?

355
00:46:14,317 --> 00:46:16,717
Yes. But it's hopeless.

356
00:46:17,353 --> 00:46:21,380
-lt's too far away.
-l wouldn't necessarily say that.

357
00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:24,259
You know how to get there?

358
00:46:24,327 --> 00:46:27,854
Sure. lt's right around the corner.

359
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,761
How did all this happen?

360
00:46:30,966 --> 00:46:32,627
With luck.

361
00:46:33,636 --> 00:46:36,537
You brought me the entire 10,000 miles?

362
00:46:36,806 --> 00:46:42,438
No. Only 9,891 ...

363
00:46:42,778 --> 00:46:44,712
...as the dragon flies.

364
00:46:45,414 --> 00:46:46,745
You're amazing.

365
00:46:47,083 --> 00:46:52,521
Having a luck dragon with you
is the only way to go on a quest.

366
00:46:52,888 --> 00:46:55,049
Things will work out fine.

367
00:46:56,592 --> 00:47:00,426
Never give up and good luck will find you.

368
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:05,192
lt's good to have a friend again.

369
00:47:08,771 --> 00:47:10,932
You have more than one.

370
00:47:12,775 --> 00:47:14,106
Look.

371
00:48:10,966 --> 00:48:13,059
Get out of my light, wench.

372
00:48:13,169 --> 00:48:15,603
You're disturbing my scientific work.

373
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:18,333
You and your scientific work.

374
00:48:18,841 --> 00:48:22,504
What the boy needs now
is one of my potions.

375
00:48:22,978 --> 00:48:26,971
The boy will need
my scientific advice much more.

376
00:48:28,517 --> 00:48:30,178
But not until he's well.

377
00:48:30,352 --> 00:48:33,651
Get back to your own corner, Engy.

378
00:48:33,889 --> 00:48:36,449
l'm always finding you in my place.

379
00:48:39,128 --> 00:48:40,959
He's well.

380
00:48:42,097 --> 00:48:43,724
Now it's my turn with him.

381
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:45,562
No, you don't!

382
00:48:46,368 --> 00:48:50,031
l'll decide when he's well.
lt's your turn when l say it is.

383
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:54,540
Well, little man, still in pain?

384
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:56,102
lt's all right.

385
00:48:56,178 --> 00:49:00,512
l like that.
The patient telling the doctor it's all right.

386
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:03,816
lt has to hurt if it's to heal.

387
00:49:07,189 --> 00:49:08,315
Drink that.

388
00:49:10,493 --> 00:49:11,425
Good?

389
00:49:12,561 --> 00:49:14,392
That's my bat-wing broth.

390
00:49:15,464 --> 00:49:18,661
There's eye of newt in there,
tree mold, old lizard brains...

391
00:49:18,734 --> 00:49:22,067
...scales from a rancid sea serpent.

392
00:49:22,404 --> 00:49:26,238
Just where did you
and your dragon come from?

393
00:49:26,575 --> 00:49:28,042
What are you on to?

394
00:49:28,277 --> 00:49:31,440
Anything of interest
to the scientific community?

395
00:49:31,514 --> 00:49:34,506
My name is Atreyu.
l came to find the Southern Oracle.

396
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:36,381
Here we go again.

397
00:49:36,585 --> 00:49:39,349
You've come to the right place, my boy.

398
00:49:39,788 --> 00:49:42,780
l am somewhat of an expert
on the Southern Oracle.

399
00:49:42,925 --> 00:49:45,894
''lt is my scientific specialty.''

400
00:49:46,228 --> 00:49:48,355
lt is my scientific specialty.

401
00:49:48,931 --> 00:49:53,664
Why don't you sit down
and be quiet for once?

402
00:49:53,769 --> 00:49:55,703
You keep quiet, wench.

403
00:49:56,105 --> 00:49:57,333
lt's my turn.

404
00:50:00,476 --> 00:50:04,708
My name is Engywook.
She's Urgl. Ever heard of me?

405
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:06,412
l don't think so.

406
00:50:07,049 --> 00:50:09,540
You don't move in scientific circles.

407
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:12,783
l am the expert on the Southern Oracle.

408
00:50:13,522 --> 00:50:15,717
You've come to the right place.

409
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:17,952
There's no fool like an old fool.

410
00:50:18,127 --> 00:50:20,459
Wait! Stay here.

411
00:50:21,397 --> 00:50:24,560
The observatory. To the winch, wench.

412
00:50:30,005 --> 00:50:33,406
Come on, lazybones!
Can't you go any faster?

413
00:50:36,278 --> 00:50:39,611
l've been studying
the Southern Oracle for years.

414
00:50:39,815 --> 00:50:41,806
Some day l'll publish my book:

415
00:50:42,017 --> 00:50:45,680
A Century ofStudying the Southern Oracle,
by Professor Engywook.

416
00:50:46,055 --> 00:50:48,046
Volume l.: The Early Years.

417
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:52,354
Have you ever been
to the Southern Oracle?

418
00:50:53,028 --> 00:50:54,427
What do you think?

419
00:50:54,496 --> 00:50:56,657
l work scientifically.

420
00:51:19,622 --> 00:51:20,611
Look.

421
00:51:29,331 --> 00:51:31,162
ls that the Southern Oracle?

422
00:51:31,734 --> 00:51:35,329
No. lt's the first of the two gates
you must pass through...

423
00:51:35,604 --> 00:51:38,095
...before you reach the Southern Oracle...

424
00:51:38,207 --> 00:51:41,301
...and get me the final information
for my book.

425
00:51:43,045 --> 00:51:45,878
Of course, most people...

426
00:51:46,882 --> 00:51:48,873
...never get that far.

427
00:51:50,386 --> 00:51:51,375
Why?

428
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,251
The Sphinxes' eyes...

429
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:57,918
...stay closed until someone
who does not feel his own worth...

430
00:51:58,327 --> 00:51:59,817
...tries to pass by.

431
00:52:08,904 --> 00:52:11,896
Here comes one that looks fancy.

432
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:20,846
Let's see what he really thinks of himself.

433
00:52:28,357 --> 00:52:30,621
Go on, scaredy-cat!

434
00:52:34,229 --> 00:52:37,995
lt's my turn. Let me see. l'm the scientist.

435
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:39,759
He's going on.

436
00:52:41,103 --> 00:52:42,695
l think he'll make it.

437
00:52:42,871 --> 00:52:47,831
The Sphinxes' eyes, are they open or shut?
Let me see.

438
00:52:48,644 --> 00:52:49,975
They're shut.

439
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:55,372
The eyes are opening!

440
00:53:10,966 --> 00:53:13,400
Did he make it? Did he?

441
00:53:20,142 --> 00:53:22,474
Fancy armor doesn't help.

442
00:53:23,178 --> 00:53:27,478
The Sphinxes can see
straight into your heart.

443
00:53:31,587 --> 00:53:32,576
Listen.

444
00:53:32,788 --> 00:53:36,155
Next time let me see what happens.
lt's my telescope.

445
00:53:40,963 --> 00:53:42,225
l'm going to try.

446
00:53:43,332 --> 00:53:46,631
Don't go yet.
l haven't told you about the next gate.

447
00:53:46,702 --> 00:53:48,829
lt's even worse than this one.

448
00:54:28,844 --> 00:54:32,211
He'll never make it.

449
00:56:05,274 --> 00:56:09,005
Don't start to doubt yourself. Be confident.

450
00:56:14,516 --> 00:56:16,848
Be confident.

451
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:25,553
Run, Atreyu!

452
00:56:26,495 --> 00:56:27,826
Run, Atreyu!

453
00:56:31,967 --> 00:56:32,934
Run! Now!

454
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:48,646
He made it.

455
00:56:48,884 --> 00:56:50,215
He made it.

456
00:56:57,526 --> 00:57:00,518
He made it!

457
00:57:04,866 --> 00:57:07,767
You could use a dose of juicy vitamins, too.

458
00:57:07,836 --> 00:57:12,671
He made it!
Atreyu made it through the Sphinx gate.

459
00:57:13,308 --> 00:57:16,038
-l always said he could do it.
-Good.

460
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:21,541
But that's no reason
to fall out of the basket again.

461
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,241
l knew he'd be safe.

462
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,247
Nonsense. You don't understand anything.

463
00:57:29,324 --> 00:57:34,159
The worst one is coming up.
Next is the Magic Mirror Gate.

464
00:57:34,997 --> 00:57:37,989
Atreyu must face his true self.

465
00:57:38,066 --> 00:57:42,162
So what? That won't be too hard for him.

466
00:57:42,237 --> 00:57:44,728
That's what everyone thinks.

467
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,403
But kind people find that they are cruel.

468
00:57:49,011 --> 00:57:52,777
Brave men discover
they are really cowards.

469
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:55,816
Confronted with their true selves...

470
00:57:55,884 --> 00:57:59,376
...most men run away screaming.

471
00:59:56,037 --> 00:59:58,369
Now, this is going too far.

472
01:00:17,826 --> 01:00:19,316
What if they...

473
01:00:19,594 --> 01:00:22,927
...really do know about me in Fantasia?

474
01:01:11,813 --> 01:01:13,804
The Southern Oracle?

475
01:01:33,335 --> 01:01:35,269
Do not be afraid.

476
01:01:36,104 --> 01:01:38,265
We willnot harm you.

477
01:01:40,408 --> 01:01:44,902
We have been waiting for you a long time.

478
01:01:49,484 --> 01:01:51,315
Are you the Southern Oracle?

479
01:01:51,786 --> 01:01:54,414
Yes, we are.

480
01:01:54,889 --> 01:01:57,551
Then you must know
what can save Fantasia.

481
01:01:57,959 --> 01:02:00,519
Yes, we do.

482
01:02:01,863 --> 01:02:04,855
Well, what is it? l have to know!

483
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:06,664
The Empress...

484
01:02:08,069 --> 01:02:09,502
...needs...

485
01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:11,936
...a new name.

486
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:17,504
A new name? That's all?

487
01:02:18,113 --> 01:02:19,273
But that's easy.

488
01:02:20,815 --> 01:02:23,079
l can give her any name she wants.

489
01:02:23,518 --> 01:02:26,146
No one from Fantasia...

490
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:28,783
...can do it.

491
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:31,852
Only a human child...

492
01:02:33,194 --> 01:02:35,526
...can give her this new name.

493
01:02:41,236 --> 01:02:44,069
A human child? Where can l find one?

494
01:02:44,572 --> 01:02:46,904
You can only find one...

495
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:52,073
...beyond the boundaries ofFantasia.

496
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:00,952
lfyou want to save our world...

497
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:03,587
...you must hurry.

498
01:03:06,695 --> 01:03:08,356
We don't know...

499
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:12,364
...how much longer
we can withstand the Nothing.

500
01:03:16,204 --> 01:03:18,069
Falkor!

501
01:03:38,426 --> 01:03:41,088
Hurry, Falkor! The Nothing's everywhere.

502
01:03:41,196 --> 01:03:42,993
Don't worry.

503
01:03:43,832 --> 01:03:46,995
We'll reach the boundaries of Fantasia.

504
01:03:47,102 --> 01:03:50,936
-Do you know where they are?
-l have no idea.

505
01:03:51,873 --> 01:03:54,205
Then how do we find a human child?

506
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:56,203
With luck.

507
01:03:57,712 --> 01:04:00,704
Faster, Falkor! We have to hurry.

508
01:04:00,915 --> 01:04:03,748
All right, hang on tight.

509
01:05:16,224 --> 01:05:18,886
What a shame they don't ask me.

510
01:05:19,894 --> 01:05:21,225
My mother...

511
01:05:21,996 --> 01:05:24,658
...she had such a wonderful name.

512
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:44,812
''On and on they flew
until they reached the Sea of Possibilities...

513
01:05:45,253 --> 01:05:47,221
''...where they could go no further.''

514
01:05:49,557 --> 01:05:51,889
Look, Atreyu. The Nothing.

515
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:53,551
Atreyu.

516
01:07:22,483 --> 01:07:24,144
Falkor!

517
01:07:28,389 --> 01:07:30,550
Where are you?

518
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,477
Atreyu! Where are you?

519
01:08:47,201 --> 01:08:50,102
They look like big...

520
01:08:50,371 --> 01:08:54,501
...good, strong hands, don't they?

521
01:08:56,177 --> 01:09:00,170
l always thought that's what they were.

522
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,187
My little friends.

523
01:09:07,622 --> 01:09:10,284
The little man with his racing snail...

524
01:09:10,591 --> 01:09:12,183
...the Night Hob...

525
01:09:12,894 --> 01:09:15,522
...even the stupid bat.

526
01:09:16,464 --> 01:09:19,297
l couldn't hold on to them.

527
01:09:20,601 --> 01:09:21,932
The Nothing...

528
01:09:23,204 --> 01:09:26,537
...pulled them right out of my hands.

529
01:09:28,109 --> 01:09:29,770
l failed.

530
01:09:30,244 --> 01:09:33,236
No, you didn't fail. l'm the one who failed.

531
01:09:33,681 --> 01:09:36,514
l was the one chosen to stop the Nothing.

532
01:09:38,186 --> 01:09:40,017
But l lost the Auryn.

533
01:09:40,521 --> 01:09:42,682
l can't find my luck dragon.

534
01:09:42,990 --> 01:09:46,482
So l won't be able to get beyond
the boundaries of Fantasia.

535
01:09:55,036 --> 01:09:56,367
Listen.

536
01:09:56,938 --> 01:09:58,428
The Nothing...

537
01:09:58,906 --> 01:10:00,806
...will be here any minute.

538
01:10:01,442 --> 01:10:03,933
l will just sit here...

539
01:10:04,645 --> 01:10:07,136
...and let it take me away, too.

540
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,411
They look...

541
01:10:11,285 --> 01:10:13,116
...like good...

542
01:10:13,554 --> 01:10:15,385
...strong...

543
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:18,787
...hands, don't they?

544
01:11:21,455 --> 01:11:22,444
Morla?

545
01:11:25,893 --> 01:11:27,383
Artax!

546
01:12:18,679 --> 01:12:20,670
lf you come any closer...

547
01:12:21,883 --> 01:12:24,716
...l will rip you to shreds.

548
01:12:31,459 --> 01:12:32,926
Who are you?

549
01:12:33,027 --> 01:12:35,359
l am Gmork.

550
01:12:37,064 --> 01:12:40,227
And you, whoever you are...

551
01:12:40,902 --> 01:12:44,633
...can have the honor
of being my last victim.

552
01:12:48,409 --> 01:12:50,104
l will not die easily.

553
01:12:50,845 --> 01:12:52,506
l am a warrior.

554
01:12:53,948 --> 01:12:55,939
Brave warrior.

555
01:12:56,484 --> 01:12:58,315
Then fight the Nothing.

556
01:12:58,386 --> 01:13:02,288
l can't. l can't get beyond
the boundaries of Fantasia.

557
01:13:04,959 --> 01:13:06,426
What's so funny?

558
01:13:06,527 --> 01:13:10,361
Fantasia has no boundaries.

559
01:13:16,671 --> 01:13:18,036
That's not true.

560
01:13:18,339 --> 01:13:21,001
-You're lying.
-Foolish boy.

561
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:25,904
Don't you know anything about Fantasia?

562
01:13:26,781 --> 01:13:29,773
lt's the world of human fantasy.

563
01:13:32,286 --> 01:13:33,947
Every part...

564
01:13:34,755 --> 01:13:36,347
...every creature...

565
01:13:37,091 --> 01:13:41,425
...is a piece of the dreams
and hopes of mankind.

566
01:13:43,764 --> 01:13:45,425
Therefore...

567
01:13:46,267 --> 01:13:49,236
...it has no boundaries.

568
01:13:57,044 --> 01:13:59,035
Why is Fantasia dying then?

569
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:03,114
Because people have begun
to lose their hopes...

570
01:14:04,385 --> 01:14:07,047
...and forget their dreams.

571
01:14:08,222 --> 01:14:11,055
So the Nothing grows stronger.

572
01:14:11,559 --> 01:14:13,049
What is the Nothing?

573
01:14:13,327 --> 01:14:15,989
lt's the emptiness that's left.

574
01:14:17,398 --> 01:14:19,559
lt is like a despair...

575
01:14:20,067 --> 01:14:22,228
...destroying this world.

576
01:14:23,004 --> 01:14:26,098
And l have been trying to help it.

577
01:14:28,042 --> 01:14:29,134
But why?

578
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:32,502
Because people who have no hopes...

579
01:14:33,247 --> 01:14:35,511
...are easy to control.

580
01:14:36,917 --> 01:14:39,579
And whoever has the control...

581
01:14:41,022 --> 01:14:43,354
...has the power.

582
01:14:58,139 --> 01:15:00,039
Who are you, really?

583
01:15:00,608 --> 01:15:02,599
l am the servant...

584
01:15:04,178 --> 01:15:07,011
...of the power behind the Nothing.

585
01:15:08,249 --> 01:15:11,582
l was sent to kill the only one...

586
01:15:12,219 --> 01:15:14,551
...who could have stopped the Nothing.

587
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:18,522
l lost him in the Swamps of Sadness.

588
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:20,491
His name...

589
01:15:21,796 --> 01:15:23,127
...was Atreyu.

590
01:15:27,668 --> 01:15:31,832
lf we're about to die anyway,
l'd rather die fighting.

591
01:15:32,573 --> 01:15:36,100
Come for me, Gmork. l am Atreyu!

592
01:17:08,435 --> 01:17:09,925
Falkor!

593
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,941
Atreyu!

594
01:17:43,804 --> 01:17:46,637
''That was the end ofFantasia.

595
01:17:47,374 --> 01:17:50,309
''Only a few fragments ofthis once...

596
01:17:50,544 --> 01:17:54,742
''...rich andbeautiful world
hadbeen left by the Nothing. ''

597
01:18:05,226 --> 01:18:07,057
Good old Falkor.

598
01:18:07,595 --> 01:18:11,964
-Can you see anything? Anything at all?
-No.

599
01:18:13,267 --> 01:18:15,758
All the land is gone.

600
01:18:16,937 --> 01:18:20,270
l know. And all because l failed.

601
01:18:21,475 --> 01:18:23,033
You tried.

602
01:18:23,477 --> 01:18:25,968
Could the lvory Tower still be standing?

603
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:30,612
Let's hope so, Atreyu. Let's hope so.

604
01:18:35,456 --> 01:18:37,447
Let the Auryn guide you.

605
01:18:39,193 --> 01:18:43,186
lf the lvory Tower still stands,
take us there.

606
01:19:03,017 --> 01:19:04,678
The lvory Tower!

607
01:20:07,948 --> 01:20:09,438
The Empress.

608
01:20:34,675 --> 01:20:36,006
Go on.

609
01:21:17,951 --> 01:21:20,784
Why do you look so sad?

610
01:21:37,638 --> 01:21:39,435
l have failed you, Empress.

611
01:21:44,144 --> 01:21:45,304
You haven't.

612
01:21:47,047 --> 01:21:48,674
You brought him with you.

613
01:21:50,717 --> 01:21:51,706
Who?

614
01:21:52,352 --> 01:21:54,582
The earthling child.

615
01:21:55,322 --> 01:21:56,914
The one...

616
01:21:56,990 --> 01:21:59,151
...who can save us all.

617
01:21:59,893 --> 01:22:02,054
You knew about the earthling child?

618
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:06,964
Of course. l knew everything.

619
01:22:08,535 --> 01:22:11,902
My horse died, l nearly drowned.

620
01:22:12,172 --> 01:22:14,572
l just barely got away from the Nothing.

621
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:17,506
For what? To find out
what you already knew?

622
01:22:17,578 --> 01:22:20,911
lt was the only way
to get in touch with an earthling.

623
01:22:21,181 --> 01:22:23,445
But l didn't get in touch with an earthling!

624
01:22:25,219 --> 01:22:26,880
Yes, you did.

625
01:22:28,155 --> 01:22:29,588
He has suffered with you.

626
01:22:30,824 --> 01:22:33,816
He went through everything
you went through.

627
01:22:35,062 --> 01:22:37,895
Andnow, he has come here...

628
01:22:38,932 --> 01:22:39,990
...with you.

629
01:22:41,168 --> 01:22:44,331
He is very close, listening...

630
01:22:45,472 --> 01:22:49,602
...to every word we say.

631
01:22:50,143 --> 01:22:51,132
What?

632
01:23:06,293 --> 01:23:10,024
Where is he?
lf he's so close, why doesn't he arrive?

633
01:23:15,369 --> 01:23:20,204
He doesn't realize
he's already part of The Neverending Story.

634
01:23:22,676 --> 01:23:24,473
The Neverending Story?

635
01:23:24,545 --> 01:23:26,137
What's that?

636
01:23:26,213 --> 01:23:29,671
Just as he is sharing all your adventures...

637
01:23:29,783 --> 01:23:32,274
...others are sharing his.

638
01:23:32,819 --> 01:23:34,081
They were with him...

639
01:23:34,454 --> 01:23:37,287
...when he hid from the boys
in the bookstore.

640
01:23:39,893 --> 01:23:41,588
But that's impossible!

641
01:23:41,828 --> 01:23:44,319
They were with him
when he took the book...

642
01:23:44,498 --> 01:23:46,557
...with the Auryn symbol on the cover...

643
01:23:47,701 --> 01:23:51,000
...in which he's reading his own story...

644
01:23:51,872 --> 01:23:53,362
...right now.

645
01:23:58,879 --> 01:24:00,870
l can't believe it.

646
01:24:02,349 --> 01:24:04,681
They can't be talking about me.

647
01:24:07,955 --> 01:24:09,980
What if he doesn't appear?

648
01:24:10,057 --> 01:24:12,457
Then our world will disappear.

649
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:15,121
And so will l.

650
01:24:18,432 --> 01:24:20,229
How could he let that happen?

651
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:25,101
He doesn't understand that he's the one
with the power to stop it.

652
01:24:25,172 --> 01:24:27,606
He simply can't imagine...

653
01:24:27,674 --> 01:24:30,541
...that one little boy
could be that important.

654
01:24:33,347 --> 01:24:34,814
ls it really me?

655
01:24:35,782 --> 01:24:37,409
Maybe he doesn't know what to do.

656
01:24:37,851 --> 01:24:39,318
What do l have to do?

657
01:24:40,087 --> 01:24:43,079
He has to give me a new name.

658
01:24:43,423 --> 01:24:45,584
He's already chosen it.

659
01:24:46,693 --> 01:24:48,684
He just has to call it out.

660
01:24:52,532 --> 01:24:55,057
But it's only a story. lt's not real.

661
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,260
lt's only a story.

662
01:24:57,771 --> 01:24:59,762
Atreyu, no!

663
01:25:24,464 --> 01:25:26,125
Bastian!

664
01:25:28,201 --> 01:25:31,864
Why don't you do
what you dream, Bastian?

665
01:25:32,205 --> 01:25:35,641
But l can't.
l must keep my feet on the ground.

666
01:25:35,942 --> 01:25:37,603
Call my name.

667
01:25:40,213 --> 01:25:43,205
Bastian, please!

668
01:25:45,218 --> 01:25:46,549
Save us!

669
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,713
All right! l'll do it!

670
01:25:48,989 --> 01:25:52,686
l'll save you. l will do what l dream.

671
01:26:17,884 --> 01:26:19,875
Why is it so dark?

672
01:26:20,754 --> 01:26:24,588
ln the beginning, it is always dark.

673
01:26:29,596 --> 01:26:31,086
What is that?

674
01:26:31,665 --> 01:26:33,826
One grain of sand.

675
01:26:34,468 --> 01:26:38,131
lt is all that remains of my vast empire.

676
01:26:45,979 --> 01:26:48,743
Fantasia has totally disappeared?

677
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:51,740
Yes.

678
01:26:54,621 --> 01:26:57,112
Then everything's been in vain.

679
01:26:57,958 --> 01:27:00,119
No, it hasn't.

680
01:27:01,461 --> 01:27:04,089
Fantasia can arise anew...

681
01:27:05,665 --> 01:27:08,327
...from your dreams and wishes.

682
01:27:10,137 --> 01:27:11,297
How?

683
01:27:12,072 --> 01:27:13,903
Open your hand.

684
01:27:28,822 --> 01:27:30,983
What are you going to wish for?

685
01:27:33,226 --> 01:27:34,523
l don't know.

686
01:27:36,363 --> 01:27:40,197
Then there will be no Fantasia anymore.

687
01:27:44,704 --> 01:27:46,433
How many wishes do l get?

688
01:27:48,041 --> 01:27:50,032
As many as you want.

689
01:27:50,877 --> 01:27:53,368
And the more wishes you make...

690
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:57,509
...the more magnificent
Fantasia will become.

691
01:27:57,818 --> 01:27:58,978
Really?

692
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,410
Try it.

693
01:28:14,634 --> 01:28:16,431
Then my first wish is....

694
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:28,614
Falkor, it's even more beautiful
than l thought!

695
01:28:39,659 --> 01:28:43,151
-Like it?
-Falkor, it's wonderful.

696
01:28:48,134 --> 01:28:51,797
Falkor, it's like the Nothing never was.

697
01:29:10,624 --> 01:29:12,785
Atreyu and Artax!

698
01:29:26,406 --> 01:29:29,398
What would you like to wish for next?

699
01:29:59,306 --> 01:30:01,297
Look, there they are.

700
01:30:02,809 --> 01:30:04,299
lt's a monster!

701
01:30:05,445 --> 01:30:09,279
Get them, Falkor!
Let's see how you like it, chickens.

702
01:30:09,582 --> 01:30:10,913
Down here.

703
01:30:25,532 --> 01:30:27,966
We're going to get you!

704
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:56,021
Bastian made many other wishes...

705
01:30:56,663 --> 01:30:59,325
...andhadmany other
amazing adventures...

706
01:31:00,433 --> 01:31:03,425
...before he finally returned
to the ordinary world.

707
01:31:04,571 --> 01:31:07,096
But that's another story.
