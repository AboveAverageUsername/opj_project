I don't need glssses

8
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:04,331
We're settling for glasses

9
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:08,713
Better 1

10
00:01:16,555 --> 00:01:18,285

13
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:52,525
You know how focus we get into our runs

14
00:01:57,863 --> 00:02:01,140
You should maybe get that looked at

15
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,497
Starts to raise some pain

16
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:05,043
I'm sure it's more fun

17
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:07,805
Bu i need you to hang the decorations
on the tree

18
00:02:07,805 --> 00:02:10,124
Not to chuck them up there
and hope it sticks

19
00:02:10,124 --> 00:02:11,818
Hey Steve

20
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,880

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,469
Thank you

22
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,273
Is there an angel on the top

23
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:19,292
I supposed to be but we can't
find 1 big enough but...

24
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:21,169
Fortunately my wife's an art collection

25
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:23,452
So she gives this Marilyn Monroe

26
00:02:23,931 --> 00:02:25,403
Looks good

27
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,833
Don't go over all with the lights
thought, we don't wanna see pecky

28
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:28,754
Where would you think?

29
00:02:28,754 --> 00:02:29,673
They would infest your baby

30
00:02:30,557 --> 00:02:32,362
We got a bit surprise in this year

31
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:33,282
Come on...

32
00:02:33,282 --> 00:02:35,602
Nobody keeps secret better than me

33
00:02:37,112 --> 00:02:38,657
I know for a fact

34
00:02:38,657 --> 00:02:41,455
Chef Dave is a cross-dresser

35
00:02:41,455 --> 00:02:43,149
I never told this all

36
00:02:43,555 --> 00:02:45,984
I only tell today

37
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:26,963
Hi honey

38
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:35,283
It's the texture rite? The grainy,
slimey, milky?

39
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:36,314
Can you taste the curry?

40
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:37,676
Yeah...

41
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:43,788
You're such a bad liar

42
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:46,475
I knew it was awful,
it was awful, rite?

43
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:48,058
Yeah

44
00:03:48,058 --> 00:03:49,752
Who wants pizza?

45
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:55,275
Excuse me?

46
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:57,373
Oh honey, you don't mean that

47
00:03:57,373 --> 00:03:59,988
What have we really accomplished?

48
00:03:59,988 --> 00:04:01,975
Half season of soccer?

49
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:07,351
Miraculously sticks in the cup scout

50
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:10,112
Hey guess what Dave is?

51
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,917
Come on, guess

52
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:12,837
Manny?

53
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:14,272
I don't know

54
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:15,304
I don't care

55
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,464
It's december 1st

56
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,759
I've to bring down the christmas
calender

57
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,263
Yes, this's a busy time of a year, so...

58
00:04:28,263 --> 00:04:30,140
We gotta've a game plan

59
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:32,424
Ok, december 3rd

60
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,019
You just get so intense about christmas

61
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:40,634
I'm not intense i'm just extremely
organised

62
00:04:40,634 --> 00:04:42,143
When you're talking about christmas

63
00:04:42,143 --> 00:04:44,684
You shouldn't use the term
flanking maneuver

64
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,740
Look, i know it's only december 1st

65
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,207
But i've all the planning to
do for the fest

66
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,784
The kids've schools

67
00:04:52,784 --> 00:04:55,139
All goes by so quickly

68
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,686
Before you know christmas'll be over

69
00:04:56,686 --> 00:04:59,374
Yeah, but that doesn't mean we've
to plan every second

70
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:02,872
Look, my dad dragged me to
1 airforce base to another

71
00:05:02,872 --> 00:05:05,375
Christmas wasn't a priority
for the family

72
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,142
We didn't even have a tree

73
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:09,352
I want things to be different for
my kids

74
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:12,702
I want them to have a big family
tradition in a year

75
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:14,249
They can count on it

76
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:16,015
They'll look forward to

77
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,340
You're rite

78
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:19,955
I'm gonna try to me more supportive

79
00:05:19,955 --> 00:05:21,428
Well, you should be

80
00:05:22,016 --> 00:05:25,919
Madison is a loner,
she's hardly any friends

81
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:30,301
Carter is a 10-year-old-boy
with a middle life crisis

82
00:05:30,522 --> 00:05:32,914
Let's face it our kids are all weird

83
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:35,750
I think this year they need christmas
more than other

84
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,480
You're rite

85
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:39,027
I'm sorry

86
00:05:39,027 --> 00:05:40,756
You're rite

87
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,990
We're gonna do it all

88
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,348
Ok?
- OK

89
00:05:56,405 --> 00:05:58,687
And i don't write cook books

90
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:00,012
What?

91
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,510
You always say that i write cook
books but i don't, i just...

92
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,045
Added other people's recipes and then
i compile them into cook books that...

93
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:08,923
Nobody buys
- Then write your own

94
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:12,457
Oh great, so all the rejections'll
just be more personal? No thank you

95
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:14,407
Oh i think you should

96
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,286
Well, i think you could

97
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,612
What's that?

98
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:25,637
Is it the truck?

99
00:06:25,637 --> 00:06:26,631
I don't know

100
00:06:36,572 --> 00:06:38,817
We've new neighbors

101
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:40,254
Who moves in the middle of the nite?

102
00:06:40,254 --> 00:06:41,616
In that flap?

103
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:46,918
How could that be?

104
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,042
Take it easy, pal

105
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,913
You've a spasm, you're having a seizure

106
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,301
It looks exactly like that

107
00:07:28,301 --> 00:07:31,209

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,204

111
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:38,388
No
- Oh good

112
00:07:38,388 --> 00:07:39,862

113
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:41,886

993
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:09,144

998
01:08:42,169 --> 01:08:43,200
Kelly!

999
01:08:53,951 --> 01:08:55,276
What a bulky fast.

1000
01:08:55,902 --> 01:08:57,081
I didn't kid any.

1001
01:08:57,338 --> 01:08:58,774
I think we should go.

1002
01:08:58,774 --> 01:08:59,952
Oh.

1003
01:09:10,297 --> 01:09:11,476
Yeah. Yeah.

1004
01:09:11,476 --> 01:09:14,421
Multi Christmas lights,
under water tree,

1005
01:09:14,421 --> 01:09:15,489
What can I say?

1006
01:09:15,489 --> 01:09:16,962
We're a cautionary tale.

1007
01:09:17,551 --> 01:09:20,791
So that fact that you
apparently purchased,

1008
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:24,067
And illegal great military fireworks,
and set it up in your home,

1009
01:09:24,067 --> 01:09:25,614
And nothing to do with huh?

1010
01:09:26,277 --> 01:09:28,302
I could have been
a contributing factor.

1011
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,136
What about this?

1012
01:09:31,983 --> 01:09:33,714
That's was nearest form of light.

1013
01:09:35,702 --> 01:09:38,316
You're gonna get a knock
my pennies, mister.

1014
01:09:38,501 --> 01:09:39,789
A real knock.

1015
01:09:40,267 --> 01:09:41,519
Alright, let's go.

1016
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:46,932
Hey kids.

1017
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:48,440
What do you...

1018
01:09:49,472 --> 01:09:51,717
Where are you going? Huh?

1019
01:09:53,559 --> 01:09:55,179
Hey, Allison.

1020
01:09:55,509 --> 01:09:56,098
What's going on?

1021
01:09:56,098 --> 01:09:57,019
Kelly.

1022
01:09:57,019 --> 01:09:58,087
Kelly, what're you doing?

1023
01:09:58,087 --> 01:10:00,516
Tring to sell at least this part
for the Christmas for the kids.

1024
01:10:00,516 --> 01:10:01,547
What? What?

1025
01:10:01,547 --> 01:10:03,057
Wait. No. You're leaving?

1026
01:10:03,057 --> 01:10:05,377
You'll leave...
Oh, come on, it's not that bad.

1027
01:10:05,377 --> 01:10:06,150
It's not that bad.

1028
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:09,021
Most of the smoke damage
was confine to the family room.

1029
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:10,421
And on the bright side,
Hey, look,

1030
01:10:10,421 --> 01:10:12,150
You always hated that wallpaper.

1031
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:14,839
Now the high pressures have completely
rips it off the walls.

1032
01:10:14,839 --> 01:10:17,195
We're gonna go stay in the motel
with TN and Twains.

1033
01:10:17,195 --> 01:10:18,153
Come on, Kelly.

1034
01:10:18,153 --> 01:10:18,704
Don't do that.

1035
01:10:18,704 --> 01:10:20,839
Don't let that...
thatjerk ruin our Christmas.

1036
01:10:20,839 --> 01:10:23,270
The only jerk ruining Christmas
around here is you.

1037
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:23,786
Me?

1038
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:24,338
Yeah.

1039
01:10:24,338 --> 01:10:24,853
Me?

1040
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:26,252
I'm trying to save Christmas.

1041
01:10:26,252 --> 01:10:27,652
Really?

1042
01:10:27,799 --> 01:10:30,118
What is your favourite
Christmas memory?

1043
01:10:30,118 --> 01:10:32,401
Well, you know what it is.

1044
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:35,715
I was 7 years old.
My dad and I moved to Alabama.

1045
01:10:35,715 --> 01:10:39,838
And... on Christmas morning we woke up
and sat on the kitchen floor.

1046
01:10:39,838 --> 01:10:41,642
Ate french fries
and drink chocolate milk.

1047
01:10:41,642 --> 01:10:42,894
Yeah. Exactly.

1048
01:10:42,894 --> 01:10:44,256
It wasn't planned.

1049
01:10:44,256 --> 01:10:45,507
It wasn't organized.

1050
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:47,459
Nobody had to enter
into their blackberry.

1051
01:10:47,459 --> 01:10:48,159
Itjust happened.

1052
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:49,411
Our family is so busy.

1053
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:50,736
We have to plan things out.

1054
01:10:50,736 --> 01:10:53,130
No. You.
You are the busy one.

1055
01:10:53,130 --> 01:10:56,074
You said that your kids need Christmas
more than you ever know.

1056
01:10:56,074 --> 01:10:58,394
What they need gonna ever is you.

1057
01:10:58,394 --> 01:11:02,039
Carter wanted
to go Christmas shopping with you.

1058
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:04,174
And he wanted to cut down that tree
with you.

1059
01:11:04,174 --> 01:11:05,831
And Madison more...

1060
01:11:05,831 --> 01:11:07,157
Madison's a teenage girl,

1061
01:11:07,157 --> 01:11:08,592
So she just pretty much ignore you.

1062
01:11:08,592 --> 01:11:09,145
But...

1063
01:11:09,145 --> 01:11:11,317
If you've been paying attention,
you would've seen it.

1064
01:11:11,317 --> 01:11:13,821
She just want you to know that
she's not a little girl anymore.

1065
01:11:13,821 --> 01:11:14,520
Yeah. Yeah.

1066
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,214
Well, that's the massive thing
that's I'm pretty clear.

1067
01:11:16,214 --> 01:11:18,129
She just don't get it.

1068
01:11:18,129 --> 01:11:21,147
Christmas tradition are borned
in those little...

1069
01:11:21,147 --> 01:11:23,540
Chocolate milk and french fries moments.

1070
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:25,381
And you can't control it.

1071
01:11:25,603 --> 01:11:29,063
We don't fit in the tiny little boxes
on your Christmas calendar.

1072
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:32,266
Oh, don't.

1073
01:11:34,917 --> 01:11:36,206
What do I eat?

1074
01:11:36,426 --> 01:11:38,746
Wait, Kelly, don't. Wait.

1075
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,730
Oh, Steve.

1076
01:11:48,171 --> 01:11:49,275
What happened to your house?

1077
01:11:49,275 --> 01:11:50,490
Did you have a fire?

1078
01:11:50,712 --> 01:11:51,559
Wait. Wait.

1079
01:11:51,559 --> 01:11:53,583
Are you telling me that
you're not even home last night?

1080
01:11:53,583 --> 01:11:54,467
No.

1081
01:11:54,688 --> 01:11:57,301
Tia and the girls
went to thier favourite motel,

1082
01:11:57,301 --> 01:11:59,695
I sent whole night
throwing little pebbles on their window,

1083
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:00,799
And try to get them to talk to me.

1084
01:12:00,799 --> 01:12:01,977
You miss the whole...

1085
01:12:04,665 --> 01:12:05,696
That's nothing.

1086
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:06,875
That's nothing.

1087
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:09,856
It's like
the kids probably left it down here.

1088
01:12:09,856 --> 01:12:10,961
Last night.

1089
01:12:11,587 --> 01:12:13,391
It's just wire that...

1090
01:12:14,017 --> 01:12:16,448
Ah, I knew it.

1091
01:12:16,448 --> 01:12:17,993
You've been stealing my power.

1092
01:12:17,993 --> 01:12:19,061
Borrowing.

1093
01:12:19,061 --> 01:12:20,423
Look, it's an extension cord,

1094
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:21,638
It goes both ways.

1095
01:12:21,896 --> 01:12:24,142
I was gonna shoot it right back
to you after the whole day.

1096
01:12:24,142 --> 01:12:25,651
It's fine. Fine. You win.

1097
01:12:25,651 --> 01:12:28,155
You win the skating,
the lights, the tress,

1098
01:12:28,155 --> 01:12:30,180
You've been twist up of
the whole time.

1099
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,469
But you know what?

1100
01:12:31,469 --> 01:12:33,310
You're so of screw up.

1101
01:12:33,494 --> 01:12:34,856
And that doesn't change
because you...

1102
01:12:34,856 --> 01:12:36,918
You put some lights on the roof.

1103
01:12:39,053 --> 01:12:40,746
Hey, pal.

1104
01:12:41,372 --> 01:12:43,213
You're gonna be spending
Christmas alone.

1105
01:12:43,213 --> 01:12:45,349
Just like the rest of us
screw ups.

1106
01:12:45,349 --> 01:12:46,895
How do you like that?

1107
01:14:06,825 --> 01:14:08,814
Um...

1108
01:14:10,397 --> 01:14:12,570
I see you taking down all the lights.

1109
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:15,073
Oh, you notice.

1110
01:14:16,435 --> 01:14:18,459
What you some kind of genius?

1111
01:14:18,717 --> 01:14:20,154
Apparently not.

1112
01:14:23,246 --> 01:14:24,756
I can't do it, buddy.

1113
01:14:26,522 --> 01:14:28,695
I can't spend Christmas without them.

1114
01:14:31,861 --> 01:14:33,519
Tell me about it.

1115
01:14:34,439 --> 01:14:35,948
This is awful.

1116
01:14:36,206 --> 01:14:37,606
It's killing me.

1117
01:14:38,857 --> 01:14:41,508
Hey, you know, Tia.

1118
01:14:42,134 --> 01:14:43,643
She's so stubborn.

1119
01:14:43,643 --> 01:14:45,337
She won't even talk to me.

1120
01:14:48,761 --> 01:14:50,307
I tried everything.

1121
01:14:54,468 --> 01:14:56,234
Maybe not everything.

1122
01:15:06,249 --> 01:15:09,784
Girls, come over here and
help us decorate the tree.

1123
01:15:09,784 --> 01:15:12,728
Mum, you're hanging the bulls
from the mini bar

1124
01:15:12,728 --> 01:15:14,718
And breaks the guy's bumper of a car.

1125
01:15:14,975 --> 01:15:17,552
Part of me for not being
in the Christmas spirit,

1126
01:15:17,552 --> 01:15:19,136
we're trying to make
the best of it, honey.

1127
01:15:19,136 --> 01:15:22,375
Yeah, you girls pick those books down
and get your butts over here.

1128
01:15:22,596 --> 01:15:23,885
Are you reading?

1129
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,309
I'm waiting to consent.
Another thing he gave to us.

1130
01:15:27,309 --> 01:15:28,597
It's really good.

1131
01:15:28,965 --> 01:15:31,617
Yeah, that's not giving me
a high cute thing.

1132
01:15:31,617 --> 01:15:34,193
Maybe I should go to
lost school or something.

1133
01:15:38,096 --> 01:15:39,459
Hey, mum. Look.

1134
01:15:40,895 --> 01:15:42,883
Carter, get back here.

1135
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:46,233
Come on. Carter, ger back here,
you little fart.

1136
01:15:52,566 --> 01:15:55,143
Mum, I'm going after
the busy guy. I gotta go.

1137
01:15:56,063 --> 01:15:57,279
Carter!

1138
01:15:57,425 --> 01:15:59,524
It likes a pet. Let's do it and go!

1139
01:16:10,348 --> 01:16:12,042
Mum, look at this, mum!

1140
01:16:52,982 --> 01:16:56,406
Mum, all these ways. We dance slight.

1141
01:16:57,438 --> 01:17:00,199
I beg you to let me do the end.
- I can tell right away.

1142
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:01,893
You've no feelings for starches.

1143
01:17:01,893 --> 01:17:03,476
Your3D sound is very bad.

1144
01:17:03,476 --> 01:17:04,506
What do you expect me to do?

1145
01:17:04,506 --> 01:17:07,158
The 3D sound and the feast of the corn...

1146
01:17:09,735 --> 01:17:12,901
We thought maybe you'll be...
hungry.

1147
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:15,810
Tia.
- You thought some lights and a TV dinner

1148
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:18,350
would make up for all the crap
that I have...

1149
01:17:23,799 --> 01:17:24,978
Is that what I think it is?

1150
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:27,039
Well, we don't have time
to do with turkey.

1151
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:30,463
So we'd need a few things
from your cook book.

1152
01:17:35,949 --> 01:17:40,220
I got you this little pre-christmas gift.

1153
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:53,953
I miss you so much, man.

1154
01:17:54,689 --> 01:17:58,371
Oh gosh, I could afford it.
I'd do ever for it.

1155
01:17:58,517 --> 01:18:00,727
Let's just say we're not going
to use our credit cards

1156
01:18:00,727 --> 01:18:02,458
for the rest of our lives.

1157
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:08,201
You think it's easy?

1158
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:11,220
Kelly, I'm so sorry. It's just that
everything got so...

1159
01:18:12,177 --> 01:18:14,166
You go along thinking you're
doing all the right things

1160
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:15,896
for the right reasons and then...

1161
01:18:16,632 --> 01:18:18,658
One day you'd blow up your house.

1162
01:18:19,210 --> 01:18:21,419
You know, the curse that is
somewhere along the way

1163
01:18:21,824 --> 01:18:23,516
Things get outta hand.

1164
01:18:24,437 --> 01:18:26,868
To seem like your whole life
has gotten so louded.

1165
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:29,555
The only thing you're gonna hear
was an empty house.

1166
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:31,544
You're right.

1167
01:18:32,095 --> 01:18:35,004
You're right, and you're right
to the eve.

1168
01:18:35,483 --> 01:18:39,791
You were here to stand.
You all, you're alright to leave.

1169
01:18:39,791 --> 01:18:41,447
But I'm so glad you're back.

1170
01:18:46,601 --> 01:18:48,111
So I can date now?

1171
01:18:48,111 --> 01:18:50,394
Several... during war time... No!

1172
01:18:51,057 --> 01:18:54,075
But, you're growing up so...

1173
01:18:54,223 --> 01:18:56,101
I guess I have to get used to that.

1174
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:59,562
Mr Hall, I take that you're right.

1175
01:18:59,562 --> 01:19:01,476
Yeah, I thought it'd be better.

1176
01:19:01,476 --> 01:19:03,722
Yeah, you better go and work it.
- Yeah, might have.

1177
01:19:03,722 --> 01:19:06,152
I bet they kinda see our house
from space.

1178
01:19:06,152 --> 01:19:07,477
We never know.

1179
01:19:07,477 --> 01:19:08,877
(Car Horning)

1180
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:10,533
Then again, maybe it will.

1181
01:19:26,696 --> 01:19:29,826
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

1182
01:19:30,893 --> 01:19:32,550
You all have to go home.

1183
01:19:33,581 --> 01:19:35,458
There's no lights tonight.

1184
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,889
Yo, but there will be.

1185
01:19:38,294 --> 01:19:40,466
Buddy, what happens?
- I don't know.

1186
01:19:40,466 --> 01:19:42,527
Well, I told them Buddy was
a little short of lights.

1187
01:19:42,527 --> 01:19:44,589
And maybe they'd like
to come and help up.

1188
01:19:44,847 --> 01:19:46,541
How many people did you call?

1189
01:19:47,129 --> 01:19:49,928
You've no idea how bad
that I said in this town.

1190
01:19:50,296 --> 01:19:54,051
MTV has said that there's someone
down into the scoring our Buddy's life.

1191
01:19:54,309 --> 01:19:55,855
They don't know it took them down.

1192
01:19:56,076 --> 01:19:57,844
Which is why we're gonna put them backup.

1193
01:19:58,396 --> 01:20:00,126
Well, you just gonna stand there

1194
01:20:00,126 --> 01:20:01,746
you're gonna help me do this thing.

1195
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:32,379
Hey, keep those torch lights on too.
Those are good too.

1196
01:20:32,379 --> 01:20:35,140
Hey, thanks for coming.
And you too, you guys.

1197
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:36,870
Oh, beautiful. Good to see you.

1198
01:20:39,558 --> 01:20:42,687
Steve, you're doing that's my job.
You got a future in this.

1199
01:20:42,835 --> 01:20:44,234
Happy Holiday, everyone.

1200
01:20:44,234 --> 01:20:47,769
Suchin Pak coming to you live from
clover down Massachusetts.

1201
01:20:47,769 --> 01:20:49,903
Well, apparently the whole town
has come out

1202
01:20:49,903 --> 01:20:52,407
to see Buddy Hall, a local car salesman

1203
01:20:52,407 --> 01:20:54,101
to achieve the impossible.

1204
01:20:54,101 --> 01:20:56,641
He's putting the Christmas like
this place in his front yard

1205
01:20:56,641 --> 01:20:59,255
that can hopefully beat
Steve from Space.

1206
01:20:59,255 --> 01:21:02,347
Now the folks on my earth have been
monitoring this situation live.

1207
01:21:02,347 --> 01:21:05,919
Guys, thanks so much for spending
your holiday plans on that.

1208
01:21:05,919 --> 01:21:08,423
Hat's not a trouble at all. Actuall, this funny vessel's mum sto

1209
01:21:08,423 --> 01:21:11,994
when they were eating the biscuits.
So, we just... we just have a laugh.

1210
01:21:11,994 --> 01:21:14,828
Oh, good time. Good time.

1211
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:17,627
Didn't they do it?! They're gonna
turn on the lights.

1212
01:21:17,627 --> 01:21:21,014
Alright, it looks like the moment
has finally arrived.

1213
01:21:21,014 --> 01:21:23,407
Come on, let's do this.
This is available. Come on.

1214
01:21:23,628 --> 01:21:26,538
Put your hand on it. Ready?
- Alright, Buddy. Everybody ready?

1215
01:21:26,538 --> 01:21:27,015
Yeah.

1216
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:28,341
I will count to 3.

1217
01:21:28,341 --> 01:21:31,470
1, 2, 3.

1218
01:21:31,802 --> 01:21:34,306
Oh!

1219
01:21:40,453 --> 01:21:43,767
You keep the works so hard and
you could be so disappointed.

1220
01:21:43,767 --> 01:21:45,792
I'm gonna go to get some candles.

1221
01:21:45,792 --> 01:21:50,358
Okay. Alright. I need plate.

1222
01:22:13,111 --> 01:22:14,952
Why don't you put on my phone?

1223
01:22:18,523 --> 01:22:22,168
#Holy night

1224
01:22:22,168 --> 01:22:28,612
#The stars are brightly shining...

1225
01:22:36,895 --> 01:22:38,294
Hey, dad.

1226
01:22:38,441 --> 01:22:41,277
I wonder it'd be great if we could do
this every Christmas.

1227
01:22:41,277 --> 01:22:43,007
What do you think?

1228
01:22:43,007 --> 01:22:44,479
Yeah.

1229
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:47,057
Yeah, we can do some in tradition
around here.

1230
01:22:48,161 --> 01:22:50,922
Buddy, I really like this town.

1231
01:22:51,327 --> 01:22:54,972
I think maybe you could ask yourjob
back and then we could stay here.

1232
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:57,182
Yeah, I like it too.
- You do?

1233
01:22:57,550 --> 01:22:59,427
I'll get my job back.

1234
01:23:00,201 --> 01:23:01,931
I'll get the job back.

1235
01:23:05,024 --> 01:23:08,853
Hey, Steve. I know maybe
I got really crazy but...

1236
01:23:08,853 --> 01:23:10,473
I just want to let you know that...

1237
01:23:10,473 --> 01:23:12,534
When we first met, I wasn't lying.

1238
01:23:12,534 --> 01:23:14,449
I really did wanna be your friend.

1239
01:23:14,633 --> 01:23:15,811
I know you did.

1240
01:23:15,811 --> 01:23:17,616
I should have let you.

1241
01:23:17,616 --> 01:23:20,376
It's Christmas. Anything can happen.

1242
01:23:20,782 --> 01:23:22,586
Can we start all over?

1243
01:23:22,843 --> 01:23:26,525
Nice to meet you.
I'm Steve Finch. You're?

1244
01:23:26,525 --> 01:23:27,850
Buggy Hall.

1245
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:31,386
Merry Christmas, Buddy.
- You too, Steve. - Yeah.

1246
01:23:31,568 --> 01:23:33,263
Yeah.

1247
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:32,502
The plug... it did it.

1248
01:24:32,502 --> 01:24:34,490
Wait... Wait, everyone. I'm getting
confirmation.

1249
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:40,160
Yes. Yes! The house is very visible.

1250
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:42,884
Succeeds.
- Yeah...!
