2
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,700
Can I borrow that for a second?

3
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,040
Ugh.

4
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,480
Jim?

5
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,650
Sup stupid?

6
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,190
So dad...

7
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,130
Like, dad, dad?

8
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,430
Like our-like our dad?

9
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,530
Who else's dad would I be talking to you about?

10
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,230
That's nuts.

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,370
When's the funeral?

12
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,370
In Kansas City, which means we have to leave...

13
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,370
Wait, did you say tomorrow?
- Yeah.

14
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,810
Oh, I can't go to that, dude.

15
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,080
What do you mean? Yeah you can.

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,180
No I can't. I have a lot
of shit going on here.

17
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,550
I can't just leave everything, ok?

18
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,820
Ten minutes ago you were passed out in a wigwam.

19
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,620
Yeah, well... no
it wasn't a wigwam.

20
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,390
Name one thing that you have to do.

21
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,160
One.

22
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,820
Like tomorrow?

23
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,760
Well tomorrow is kind of more of a setup day.

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,430
But I've got a lot of things to...

25
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,170
If I named it, you wouldn't understand it because...

26
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,130
It would-they're so
long-range that you wouldn't

27
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,140
understand how they work.

28
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,140
Just name one thing. One thing.

29
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,300
I'm getting a bird tomorrow.

30
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,210
I'm getting a bird. I can't
have the guy drop the bird

31
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,480
off tomorrow and me not be there

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,350
yeah, I'm being extremely serious, dude.

33
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,820
It sounds like it's not a big thing...

34
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,620
That doesn't count, Dave.
That's not...

35
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,360
Dude, I appreciate this whole thing about you

36
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,760
and don't think it doesn't touch me right here, dude.

37
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,860
But... bottom line,
I just can't go.

38
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,500
I'll give you a hundred and fifty dollars if you

39
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,900
get in my car right now.

40
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,300
Let's go.

41
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,320
Hey dude, get dressed.

42
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,890
We got to meet mom and
Michelle at the steak-

43
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,720
get out of my room!

44
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,760
It's my room too, Dave.

45
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,560
You left and now it's my room, ok?

46
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,290
Yeah, that's not how it works.

47
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,860
That's kind of exactly
how it works. It's called

48
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,300
the case of finders versus
keepers, and you're not involved

49
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,770
what are you looking for?

50
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,540
I'm looking for my Alonzo mourning rookie card.

51
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,910
And please get out, because I'm trying to find it and

52
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,540
your gonna screw up my whole process.

53
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,480
But that's not why I want the
card. The card's worth like-

54
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,180
where the hell are my avs posters?

55
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,880
You're avs posters are gone.
I took those down.

56
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,320
Why'd you take down my avalanche posters?

57
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,720
Because the
avalanche suck, dude. Ok?

58
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,250
Redwings are where it was at.

59
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,720
I don't want any losers on my walls.

60
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,920
Well where'd you put 'em?

61
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,690
I don't-I don't want people
thinking I'm a chelio's fan.

62
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,760
Nobody's gonna mistake you for a chelios fan, ok.

63
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,330
Dude's a fucking warrior.

64
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,570
You're definitely more of a forsberg guy.

65
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,300
I think people can tell that.

66
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,770
Please, get out of my room!

67
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,670
I'm trying to help you.

68
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,940
You're trying to bother me when I'm trying to work.

69
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,540
Stop!

70
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,310
If I wasn't so scared about tombstome pile driving you on

71
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,350
top of the card I'm looking for
and breaking it, your ass would

72
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,720
be on the ground right now. Ok?

73
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,490
Dude, an Alonzo mourning card
is not worth a lot of money.

74
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,260
It's gotta be worth at least ten grand by right now.

75
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,490
I bet you ten grand that it's not worth ten grand.

76
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,330
I'll be you ten grand that if you hit me with that

77
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,900
umbrella again, I'm gonna knock your teeth out.

78
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,630
Oww! Fuck, stop doing that!

79
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,500
So you wanna shove that whole
garbage bag behind the toilet

80
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,300
for like... two weeks, right?

81
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,570
Pop a straw in it, make sure it doesn't blow up.

82
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,670
There you go, you have a big bag of wine.

83
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,540
You know it's free, right?

84
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,680
What? Yeah. Just uh...

85
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,780
Saving this for later.
Jeez is that Ok?

86
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,020
My dad's dead, and this guy's being a fucking asshole.

87
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,850
Yeah, last time I saw Devin he looked horrible.

88
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,990
Devin? Who's that?

89
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,460
Shut up, you don't know 'em.

90
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,460
His hair's falling out.
- Gross.

91
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,330
He's super fat.
- Woof.

92
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,490
Looks like he has a sunburn all the time.

93
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,960
My two boys!

94
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
Oh mom, you found the wine.

95
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,770
Hi mom.

96
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,570
It's so good to see the two of you together again.

97
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,440
I'm just glad we could get this guy down here.

98
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,940
I just wish your father was here to see

99
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,940
how handsome you both look.

100
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,850
He always was so...

101
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,750
It made him so happy to see his two boys together.

102
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,850
Oh, I'm sorry honey.

103
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,720
I... I'm going to go grab
some of nonna's biscotti.

104
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,390
Can I bring either of you anything?

105
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,930
I'm good.
- It's fine, thank you.

106
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,930
Bye mom.

107
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,560
Ok, here we go.

108
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,900
I'll tell you what, she's right
though. We do look pretty fly.

109
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,070
You look like an idiot.

110
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,740
You're wearing a tuxedo to a funeral.

111
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,910
You look like a valet.

112
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,610
It's what you wear to a funeral.

113
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,480
You don't wear a sweater and like a sweater tie,

114
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,520
or whatever that is, ok?

115
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,780
A sweater tie?
- You wear black.

116
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,050
Hey, you know what time it is?

117
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,690
Oh.

118
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,420
You're wearing a watch which is what's fucked up.

119
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,730
Hey, what are you doing?

120
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,700
Hey, what's up?

121
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,760
What's that?

122
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,370
Uh... our inheritance.

123
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,770
Oh, nice. We rich, man?

124
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,100
Not quite. We did get
the lake house though.

125
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,340
Awesome, what else?

126
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,110
Uh, that's it.

127
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,510
Yeah, but apparently it's worth a fortune.

128
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,840
Great. So I need
you to sign here.

129
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,350
Then I'm going to go down to branson, talk to dad's

130
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,750
business partner Charbineau.

131
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,950
He's gonna sell it for us, we'll get big checks,

132
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,720
I'll give you yours, I'll get mine...

133
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,090
Because I need to get changed before we go.

134
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,890
I'm definitely coming with-
you're not going by yourself.

135
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,090
Dude, you're not coming with me.

136
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,700
You're-I know what
you're trying to do.

137
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,370
Dude, there's no deal. It's
all laid out in the will.

138
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,740
It's simple. We sign it over.

139
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,970
Not gonna know what to get, and what I need, ok?

140
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,710
Oh, all my fucking basketball-
- Of value.

141
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,680
All my fucking baseball cards.
- Of value.

142
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,080
My Alonzo mourning rookie card.

143
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,620
I have a game worn belford Jersey, three or four Simon

144
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,990
games, I don't think you can even buy anymore.

145
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,960
I don't even think Milton Bradley makes those anymore.

146
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,390
Six month's later, everything seems to be Ok, right?

147
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,460
No he didn't say I could borrow
the car, but I knew he was gonna

148
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,030
be passed out all day, so the next thing I know,

149
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,130
I'm getting pulled over.

150
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,030
Whatever. I gotta
couple fake ids.

151
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,770
What's in the trunk? Case of
Antonio menderes cologne.

152
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,770
Stolen. Hot.
Malik told me it fell

153
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,110
off a truck later, I don't believe that

154
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,610
anyway, I get called in, become
a guest of the state for a

155
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,710
couple months, and uh...

156
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,550
Jim!
- Stop! Did you see that?

157
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,550
I didn't do anything.

158
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,550
It's an umbrella.

159
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,020
Jim?
- It's an umbrella.

160
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,490
Bad luck, illegal.

161
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,590
Not-shouldn't be
doing it at dinner.

162
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,820
Why would you do that?
- Are you twelve?

163
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,760
Anyway, what were we talkin' about?

164
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,530
Horsemilk? You said horsemilk.

165
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,730
I like chocolate milk.

166
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,730
That's why that whole story came out of that.

167
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,800
Speaking of horsemilk, where's Matt?

168
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,900
Max.

169
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,140
His name's Max.

170
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,470
He's asleep.

171
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,540
He's tired.

172
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,810
He's sleeping?

173
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,510
Does he-is he austistic?

174
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,710
David?
- Why would you say that?

175
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,710
What?

176
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,180
No, he doesn't have autism.

177
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,580
He's four, dude. Little
kids sleep all the time.

178
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,690
It's like they get tired.
They get real tired.

179
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,150
So Dave, where are you living now?

180
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,760
Because we keep sending you Christmas cards and you never

181
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,060
why I'm not getting
those. But uh...

182
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,160
In regards to where I live,
I've been kind of on the road.

183
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,530
I've been kind of in and out of
places the last couple of years.

184
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,570
Lot of private security things
that I've been puttin' together.

185
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,840
Yeah, he worked at uh-he worked
at pranks for eight months,

186
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
until he accidentally pepper sprayed himself.

187
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,480
And his partner.

188
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,950
What? No that's a fuckin' lie.
Who told you that?

189
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,010
Hey, watch your mouth.

190
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,650
Alright everyone, I'd like to
propose a toast to Ben brulet.

191
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,960
Not just my brother but my best friend as well.

192
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,730
I... I don't think there's
anyone at this table who's

193
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,960
life wasn't changed for the better because of him.

194
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,860
He was a great man.

195
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,870
A great father, and a great brother.

196
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,770
To the colonel.

197
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,880
What are you doing?

198
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,580
What is that?

199
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,650
Dave?

200
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,150
Jim!

201
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,790
Come on.

202
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,890
Are you joking?

203
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:52,760
Are you crazy?

204
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,960
What are you doing?

205
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,790
Ahh!

206
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,630
What?

207
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,700
Stop that.

208
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,600
What are you trying to prove?

209
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,770
Jim, stop it!

210
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,870
You're humiliating me.

211
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,140
Stop it!

212
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,650
Come on, baby.

213
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,680
You're a fucking snake and I'm gonna expose you to

214
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,850
the entire family.

215
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,920
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

216
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,650
You know what you didn't take into account?

217
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,650
You're humiliating me right now.
Stop it!

218
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,290
I'm crazy.

219
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,820
That's my card!

220
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,030
Give me the card!

221
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,130
No, no!

222
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,730
No!

223
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,330
Stop!

224
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,600
Alonzo!

225
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,710
Baby, stop it.

226
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,070
Stop doing this!

227
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,250
Oh my God.

228
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,680
Stop! Honey, stop it.

229
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,820
Come on, come on. Get up,
get over here.

230
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,320
Are you boys done?
- I'm done.

231
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,650
Are you boys done?

232
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,760
I'm fine. I'm cool
as a cucumber.

233
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,160
You're bleeding.
You're both bleeding.

234
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,330
You're father would be in splits right now

235
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,360
if he saw you like this.

236
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,200
What the fuck? What the
hell are ya...?

237
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,610
Did you say something?

238
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,380
Because if you said something,
I wouldn't be able to hear it.

239
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,380
Somebody, like, just broke my eardrum.

240
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,650
So...

241
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,120
You have to talk pretty loud.

242
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,320
I can't believe you're married with a kid, dude.

243
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,220
That is so fucked up.

244
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,290
I know.

245
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,230
It's not even like a tiny
person. That's what it is.

246
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,000
If you fuck up showing him how to be a person,

247
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,740
he turns really fucked up.
That's a lot of responsiblity.

248
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,010
I think about this stuff all the time, Dave.

249
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,340
Me too, dude, believe it or not.

250
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,980
Yeah, if you would've hung out with me more...

251
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,350
You know, recently, you would know stuff like that.

252
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,980
Can we-have a...

253
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,020
Have a sweat lodge sesh?

254
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,220
Uh Ok, well that was called a vision quest.

255
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,390
Totally different thing.

256
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,790
Oh yeah?

257
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,820
I had some deep shit going on.

258
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,760
Because it looked like you were
passed out naked-

259
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,830
meditating.

260
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,000
That wouldn't have been such a
shock to you, if you had maybe

261
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,840
hung out with me more and kinda known what I was into.

262
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,100
What the fuck are you talking about right now?

263
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,870
I'm talking about that you never fucking...

264
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,810
Had-gave two shits enough to
go find me until you had to.

265
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,250
I don't-I don't feel bad, dude.

266
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,750
Like...

267
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,890
I went to college, I got a job.

268
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,390
I'm starting to build a life.

269
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,420
If you want to be part of that,
you can be part of it, man.

270
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,220
But I'm not gonna chase you down to be your brother.

271
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,790
Well I'm just saying...

272
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,860
Maybe give me a call once in awhile.

273
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,700
You know, I hate fucking talk
radio though, so we gotta...

274
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,710
I gotta lot of mix tapes I can bring, but...

275
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,710
You think you're coming with me to branson?

276
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,780
You really-you honestly think-

277
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,210
I know I'm coming with you.

278
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,720
Like, that? That display
convinced you take you with me?

279
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,920
I'm not trying to convince you.

280
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,050
I don't have to convince you of anything.

281
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:11,060
You saw the fucking protocol that Uncle Mitch gave us.

282
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,460
Half that house is mine.

283
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,290
I'm pretty sure even more than half after that

284
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,860
arm wrestling display.

285
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,900
I think legally that's like a binding thing.

286
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,470
You're way more interested in
the law than I thought you were.

287
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,400
I've been around it a lot.

288
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,000
We ruined our dad's funeral.

289
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,470
That's why we gotta fix this, dude.

290
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,940
This is the perfect chance to do it.

291
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,070
I don't want the next funeral we show up to, you to pull

292
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,740
a piece on me or something.

293
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,510
Or a blade.

294
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,180
I have a blade on me.

295
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,070
So dad's dead, huh?

296
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,410
Yeah, dude, dad's dead.

297
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,480
That sucks.

298
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,780
It really-like
it fucking sucks.

299
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,050
It's the worst.

300
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,550
When was the last time you saw him?

301
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,390
Can we not talk about this?

302
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,430
So this is it, huh?

303
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,100
Yep, two years of my life, man.

304
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,430
Two years.

305
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,100
Gives you that much.

306
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,870
You didn't do any bullshit
double sp-oh yeah.

307
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,240
I don't wanna be a weirdo...

308
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,440
But could you maybe put your pants back on?

309
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,470
While we're in the car?

310
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,340
Oh I never wear pants on the road.

311
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,080
Why?

312
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,350
You should try it, man, I'm telling you.

313
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,250
Real freedom of movement down here.

314
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,350
If you weren't in here, I wouldn't even have boxers on.

315
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,880
And the car wouldn't be moving.

316
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,890
Good news is I got a lot of tapes.

317
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,190
I picked up a lot a-
couple of mixed tapes.

318
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,830
Couple of classics I just brought along anyways.

319
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,360
What the fuck are you doing?

320
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,430
You're-you're ruining
my car with my books.

321
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,170
How am I ruining it?

322
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,970
No, I want you put them in a bag or something.

323
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,970
Where do you want me to do it?

324
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,170
In your hand. I don't know.

325
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,370
In your hand.

326
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,340
Haven't you ever eaten peanuts before?

327
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,950
We'll just do-well...

328
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,380
Do we even have a tape deck?

329
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,850
I don't know if it's the frequency of the radio, or the

330
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,190
lines running together, I just get like hypnotized.

331
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:26,160
Full-time passenger for
the rest of the trip.

332
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,160
Oh my God. What are you doing?

333
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,160
What? I'm eating these donuts.

334
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,330
You're eating out of the garbage?

335
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,330
So, that's disgusting.
What's wrong with you?

336
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,500
They're not touching anything.
They were just on top.

337
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,340
Everything in that bin is dirty.

338
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,970
So it doesn't get all the rest of this clean stuff dirty.

339
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,040
You ever think that maybe I'm the way I am because

340
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,980
you made me this way?

341
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,410
You literally have a mouthfull of trash right now, and

342
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,020
somehow this is my fault?

343
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,320
Well...

344
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,190
You know what they say, one man's trash...

345
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,490
Another man's treasure.
Another man's treasure.

346
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,160
Perfect example.

347
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,930
Hope you get hepatitis.

348
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:05,160
No way. Iron stomach.

349
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,130
Not a rumble.

350
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,340
Are these hotdog cheeseburgers
more cheeseburgery or hotdogy?

351
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,950
Check it out.

352
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,120
The gal said nobody bought one in like a week.

353
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,180
Gonna throw them all out.
Total score, huh?

354
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,450
Please get rid of those.

355
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,490
You don't have to tell me twice, brother.

356
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,290
Mm mm mm.

357
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,070
She wasn't kidding.
I don't know about a week.

358
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,070
C'mon, man! Jesus Christ.

359
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,210
Looks like dad's watch.
Where'd you get that?

360
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,970
It is dad's watch.
He gave it to me.

361
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,640
He gave-like after he
died you stole it from him?

362
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,580
He gave it to me two years ago when I graduated college?

363
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,080
Really?
- Yeah.

364
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,150
Let me see it.

365
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,550
No. It's the only thing I have.

366
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,390
I don't even want a watch.

367
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,260
It's a road trip dude, we need some tunage, ok?

368
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,060
That's half the fun of road trips.

369
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,660
A. Taking your pants off.

370
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,000
B. Listening to tight tunes
with your brother.

371
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,440
So you got a kid, you wrote a book, what else is new?

372
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,740
See summer slam?

373
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,140
It's a roadtrip, we need music.
What are you doing?

374
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,580
I want to listen to the twins game.

375
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,280
Well I don't, ok?

376
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,450
Well, I don't care.

377
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,650
You're really fucking harshin' the buzz on this roadtrip.

378
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:36,750
At least let me buy a discman
and some fireworks over here.

379
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,060
Let me get some inexpensive headphones.

380
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:41,730
Dave.

381
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,030
Dave?

382
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,530
Dave!

383
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,640
Your fucking stereo is fucking sucking up all the juice.

384
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,110
Well, don't wear so many fucking layers.

385
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,380
I'll wear whatever I want.
It's my car.

386
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,780
I can't listen to music on my own discman?

387
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,710
I can't do all these rules anymore, man.

388
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,250
There wouldn't be any rules if I didn't have to

389
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,580
just like act like a normal person for once in your life.

390
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,490
And you're just fucking laying these rules on me.

391
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,550
I'm trying to be patient with you.

392
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,690
It's like goddamn Nazi Germany.

393
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,290
You're not allowed to say that.
My wife's Jewish.

394
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,530
Give me the watch.

395
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,200
Dude, you're dreaming.
- I want the watch.

396
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,100
There's no way you're ever going to get this watch.

397
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,670
Well, I'll take it if I want.
I'm asking you first.

398
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,340
I dare you, I fucking dare you.

399
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,670
Don't touch me, man.

400
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,170
Dude, I'm driving. Come on, man.

401
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,270
Give me the hat.
- Give me my hat back.

402
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,380
Don't fuckin' hit me again, dude.

403
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,440
Do not fucking hit me again.

404
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,180
Or what? What are you
going to do?

405
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,310
You're breaking like four rules here.

406
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,750
Go.

407
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,490
Let go. Don't fucking...

408
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,610
I'm pretty sure the rest of my
cards are down here, and I know

409
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,210
I had doubles of the zoa card so
you better hope I can find it.

410
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,780
And definitely all my karate trophies.

411
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,580
I don't remember you being any good at karate.

412
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,220
I remember kicking your ass a bunch.

413
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,420
I will give you one percent of my half of the house

414
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,550
no. You're not getting
the watch, Dave.

415
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,500
Jesus. Look at all this trash.

416
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Maybe there's squatters living here.

417
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,200
Were you partying down here, Dave?

418
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,400
No.

419
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,740
Fuck, it's locked.

420
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,780
Uncle Mitch didn't give you a key?

421
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,710
No, he didn't give me a key.

422
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,580
I bet I can handle this.

423
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,750
Got it.

424
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,160
Now this one's not even locked I don't think.

425
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,560
Spare key.

426
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,630
Well open the fucking door, man.

427
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,500
Move, dude, I have to go to the bathroom.

428
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,600
And don't touch my cards if you find 'em.

429
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,670
Were mom and dad, like, secret party animals?

430
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,390
I think we have a hole in the roof or some kind of

431
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,390
water leak up here.

432
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,390
Ah cripes.

433
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,400
This place is trashed.

434
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,900
Jesus.

435
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,380
Shit.

436
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,220
Oww.

437
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,690
Fuck.

438
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,560
What are you doing down here?
We have a problem.

439
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,660
I'm trying to turn the power back on.

440
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,730
I think we have some pretty serious wasps.

441
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,470
We gotta fuckin' huge skunk I just saw in the bathroom.

442
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,510
Now to lure it out, we're gonna
usually-we'll usually drill a

443
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,540
hole in the central part of the
house, try and find one of its

444
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,310
young. If it's the mother,
it will follow it out.

445
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
Get it right there, ok?

446
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,380
Garbage bag, shovel, smash it,

447
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,750
burn it, eat it, whatever ya want.

448
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,960
If it's the father, then we got
a whole other set of problems.

449
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,540
Now the skunks are the worst.

450
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,650
Oh dinosaur museum plus haunted house.

451
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,380
That sounds spooky.

452
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,580
Just one more second.

453
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,450
Have you got some patience in your pocket?

454
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,720
Could we get a double for tonight?

455
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,430
Oh a double, let me look on the computer and

456
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,890
see if we got one for ya.

457
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,500
Yeah, looks like we're all booked up.

458
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,330
Yeah, convention in town, I guess.

459
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,530
Really? 'Cuz there's nobody
in the parking lot...

460
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,940
Yeah, I guess the only thing available is the guesthouse,

461
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,410
but that's where I'm staying.

462
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,910
Yeah so if you guys wanna come over.

463
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,080
I bet we can all squeeze in there.

464
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:02,880
Just you on top of
me on top of him. Right?

465
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,450
It's a joke. I'm jokin' with ya.

466
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,750
I'm jokin' with ya, buddy.

467
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,690
I'm jokin' with ya.
It's fine, it's fine.

468
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,960
Yeah, you can just get any single possible room in the

469
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,960
we can get ya the honeymoon suite and that's got a

470
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,360
a built in jacuzzi.

471
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,330
And we got some champagne on ice for ya.

472
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,600
We got a two foot pyramid of flavored condoms that we put

473
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,700
I like that, that sounds pretty good.

474
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,110
No we just want a regular-

475
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,810
the thing about this jacuzzi is it's an old jacuzzi.

476
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,840
'Cuz I hate these new jacuzzis.
I hate having to break one in.

477
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,010
There's no television.
And there's one bed.

478
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,810
So you guys will have to cuddle up with each other.

479
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,720
What about the guest house thing
you were mentioning earlier?

480
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,890
I've got four beds, but I push them all together.

481
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,090
So don't worry though, I think we can all squeeze

482
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,820
in there if we like.

483
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,530
Can I talk to you outside for a second?

484
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:51,560
Do you need help getting your bags outta your car?

485
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,530
'Cuz I'm a...

486
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,500
...I'm a helpful little helper.

487
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,970
Always a bridesmaid I guess.

488
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,900
Fuck!

489
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,840
That guy was kind of weird huh?

490
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,710
I don't see us beating that honeymoon sweet deal though.

491
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,610
There's no way that we're staying here.

492
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,810
You're going back to the house with the skunks?

493
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,380
I wouldn't suggest it.

494
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,520
Alright, what do you want to do?

495
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,450
Yeah, the guy with the wonder years haircut.

496
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,950
Sir, may I see your room key please?

497
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,050
Yeah, sure.

498
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,500
You know what, I think I left it in my room.

499
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,000
Just tell me your room number and I'd be happy

500
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
to go to the front desk and make you a new one.

501
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,780
I don't have a room number.

502
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,110
Because I don't have a room here.

503
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,850
I'm stealing this breakfast.

504
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,820
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you leave.

505
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,680
Alright.

506
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,260
Hey.

507
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,730
Hey!

508
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:03,960
Hey!

509
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,860
Ah fuck.

510
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,500
What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

511
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,070
What?
- What are you doing?

512
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,540
I woke up, you were gone.

513
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,800
You were trying to fuckin' leave me.

514
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:16,540
I got you a fucking breakfast, dude.

515
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,540
Get in the car.

516
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,640
Fuck you.

517
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,050
Get in the car.

518
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,820
What the fuck?

519
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,210
How did this place get so messy?

520
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,670
I don't know what you're talking about man.

521
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,810
It looks the same to me.

522
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,180
What, are you blind?

523
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,780
Mom and dad were neat freaks.

524
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,780
This looks like homeless people lived here.

525
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,150
Well if they were living here,
then they wouldn't be homeless.

526
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,920
Well, I don't know... you're
living here and you're homeless.

527
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,320
Well, you're here...

528
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,060
Hmm?

529
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,560
You're brain stopped working there for a second.

530
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,160
Oh, check it out, dude.

531
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,890
Found dad's old bowlng ball.

532
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,130
Think it still works?

533
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,330
Um, I'd assume so.

534
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,240
Alright, all this stuff can come
out of my half of the house.

535
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,340
Alright. But just wait until I
get out of the way before you-

536
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,210
ohh!
- What the fuck dude?

537
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,780
You gotta give me the watch
now because I got it first try.

538
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,010
Those are the rules.
- I didn't agree to that.

539
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,740
Gravity test, heads up.

540
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,710
This is how you spot a dude who
just bought a jet ski, alright.

541
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,080
He's sitting like this.

542
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,250
He's sitting like this, alright?

543
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,620
You want your center of gravity all the way back.

544
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,360
You want your butt almost in the water.

545
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:44,360
This is for cigarrettes, whatever, kegger, anything.

546
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,700
That's what you wanted to show me?

547
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,760
Yeah.

548
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,730
Come on man, we're gonna be late.

549
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,900
Let's go meet Charbineau.

550
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,900
You know him too. You've met
him like fifteen times.

551
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,240
I don't know this guy. I've
never met this guy before.

552
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,340
He's been dad's business partner your whole life.

553
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,040
You've met him like
twenty-five fuckin' times.

554
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,080
No, that's not true.

555
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,110
Yeah, it is.

556
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,740
Unless... wait, is he?

557
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,810
He's not like a big, giant puerto rican guy, is he?

558
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,950
Ok, I thought it was somebody else.

559
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,850
Who was that guy dad used to hang out with?

560
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,020
That puerto rican guy.

561
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,990
That's not this guy, are you sure?

562
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,220
I don't think you're thinking of dad.

563
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,890
Well I know what dad looks like.

564
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,130
Do you?

565
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,760
Yeah.

566
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,140
I think you want to go mezzanine first.

567
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,000
Do mezzanine level first.
- Can you just stop?

568
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,370
Do mezzanine level first, then check in,

569
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,710
and then, were gonna...
- Stop, Dave.

570
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,780
Did you hit it?

571
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,780
We'll check in and then we'll...

572
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,760
That was a cheap shot, man.

573
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,960
Fuck you.

574
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,060
Buggy, it's me.

575
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:58,370
I... I want early bird and
elmo mo mo in the third.

576
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,700
Ten large. No ten large.

577
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,870
Each. Alright, bye bye.

578
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,240
Well, well, well.

579
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,120
You had me worried you two.

580
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,380
Your little tussle the other night.

581
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,220
Look at ya. Look at ya.

582
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,390
Just a little brotherly competition.

583
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,960
Ah good.
- Which I won by the way.

584
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,330
What business do we have here today, gentleman?

585
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,700
We're just signing some papers and picking up some cash

586
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,360
I think.

587
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,170
Slow down there chief.

588
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,740
Not quite that simple.

589
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,870
Now I'm not sure if you've seen, but it's not exactly

590
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,210
in it's best condition.

591
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:39,440
It needs to go through a little restoration process.

592
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,380
It's... let's see
what we got here.

593
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,350
Yep, alright. There you go.

594
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,920
Roof damage. A couple of
walls need retouching,

595
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,290
new furnace, switchboard, uh pest control.

596
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,030
It shouldn't be a problem to take care of.

597
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,730
Just a couple weeks worth of work.

598
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,730
We were sort of under the impression that we'd show up,

599
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,840
sign it over to you, get some checks today possibly.

600
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,040
Uh, I could try to sell it for you the way it is.

601
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,340
The bigger problem, is that the off season just started,

602
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:16,110
so noone's looking to
develop right now. But uh...

603
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,380
We know you have nowhere to go, but I have a job.

604
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,190
Do we have a plan b?

605
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:25,520
Well, the contractor can get this baby looking brand new.

606
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,290
Couple weeks worth of work.

607
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:31,260
Uh, that might be your best bet unless you want to, uh,

608
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,960
ride it out until spring.

609
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,330
Two months doesn't sound too bad.

610
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,330
You need to stop talking.

611
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,270
We're not going to do that.

612
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:44,370
Sounds like to me hiring up a crew is the next step.

613
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,140
Now I can make recommendations.

614
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,310
Or I could put the whole thing together for you.

615
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,950
Alright, alright, what kind of rip do you get on that?

616
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,890
We use your goons, you get a kick back of what?

617
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:58,790
20 percent?
That's the scam? Ok...

618
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,860
That might work on these yokels here, asshole.

619
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,860
But I've been rolled enough to see it coming.

620
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,400
I see you coming, and I see right through you.

621
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
I think what my dumb brother's
trying to say is we appreciate

622
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,540
your help, we're not really in the position to bring

623
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,840
what's this? What
are you doing here?

624
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,840
What, you give me a hundred, I give you two hundred?

625
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,080
Is this the cup in the ball?

626
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,440
I don't know what's going on here.

627
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,350
Jim, can I talk to you outside for a second?

628
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,480
Yeah. Come here. I have
to talk to you outside.

629
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:31,920
Me and you, fixing the house together.

630
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,020
No. Absolutely not.

631
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:33,920
Alright, listen. Hear me out.

632
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,430
Listen, listen!

633
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,390
I know how to do all the stuff.

634
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,200
I'll do all the floorplans.

635
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,130
I'll write-I'll make
the blueprints myself.

636
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,030
Dude, we don't know how to fix a fucking house.

637
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,240
I know how to fix houses. I
fixed houses for two years.

638
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,240
Oh, when did you fix houses for two years?

639
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,010
Tulsa? You mean when you
were working at a zoo?

640
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,380
Yeah, I worked at a zoo,
building animal-

641
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,180
you were a groundskeeper. You
were a groundskeeper at a zoo.

642
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,880
You picked up dog shit and fed mice to snakes.

643
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,520
Why would there be dogs at a zoo?

644
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,520
The whole point of a zoo is
you get to see animals that you

645
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,920
that's your first point?
That's your first point?

646
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:12,130
Maybe the forty fucking houses
I built after hurricane Katrina

647
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,100
where I volunteered, because I had to.

648
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,470
Let's assume that you did know what you were doing.

649
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,640
I don't have time to watch you dick around trying to

650
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,240
fix a house. I gotta get
back to my life.

651
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,870
My kid and my lady.

652
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,570
You're picking them over me.

653
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,410
I'm not picking anybody over anybody.

654
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,210
Sounds like your new family is a little more important

655
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:31,950
dude, come on. I don't have an
old family or a new family.

656
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,920
I have a family.

657
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,350
But they need me now.

658
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,990
If you won't do it for me, do it for dad.

659
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,090
That's not cool.

660
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,620
Don't fucking say shit like that.

661
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,130
If you're not doing it for dad, do it for me.

662
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,900
Well John, Dave and I were talking outside and I think...

663
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,900
I think we're gonna take this renovations on ourselves.

664
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,040
Is that a fact?

665
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,170
Sure is.

666
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:59,910
Well, I'm not gonna try and stop you.

667
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:03,950
But... if I was a
betting man, and I am.

668
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:06,650
I'd bet my balls that you don't
get passed the front door.

669
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,350
Oh is that so? Well I
got news for you, John.

670
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,090
I fixed that door last night actually, so...

671
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,690
And that's a fact.

672
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,190
I can fix that. I can fix that.

673
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,130
Fix that real quick.

674
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,630
Nothing wrong.

675
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,700
Probably fine.

676
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,400
You know what, we'll put that on my tab.

677
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,970
We'll get a tab going.
We'll put that on the tab.

678
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:28,540
Boy you two, you remind me exactly of your father.

679
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,070
Ah now he's trying to get into our head.

680
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,110
That's it, that's it.

681
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,680
You boys go do what you need to do.

682
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,380
I'll be here if you need me.
How does that sound?

683
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,580
Great.

684
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,990
In the meantime...

685
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:46,120
Your father had me put together
a little nest egg for you.

686
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,560
There's a lot of money here, man.

687
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,070
He planned well for a rainy day.

688
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,600
This is for the door.

689
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,040
Well played kemosabe, well played.

690
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,330
Dude, I guarentee that guys crew is the Russian mafia.

691
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,500
He was talking about a construction crew, dummy.

692
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:33,200
Russian mafia, dude. That's
what I'm telling you.

693
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,570
They shang hai 'em by the dozen.

694
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,340
They ship them in by the boatload, man.

695
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,740
We do not want to get mixed up with that shit.

696
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,280
Plus, we're gonna save a shitload of money.

697
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,510
It's an awesome brother project
to do together which is like

698
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,120
the reason we're down here.

699
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,450
The car. I'll get the supplies
right now and come back.

700
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,260
No.
- Why? Just killing two birds-

701
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,290
I'm not going to let you drive my car.

702
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,290
Why?
- 'Cuz you're a crazy person.

703
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,290
No, I'm not. I know what to-
do you wanna go?

704
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,500
No. I gotta-

705
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,530
you download your blogcast and I'll go do the real work.

706
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,170
Dude, this is a pretty involved thing.

707
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,440
I feel like we should-
- I've walked around.

708
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,640
Shouldn't we like talk to a guy or something?

709
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,440
Yeah, we're the guys.
That's the best part.

710
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,510
Just me and you. We
get to figure it out.

711
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,510
So I'll bring it back and then we'll get started.

712
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,210
Ok?

713
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,350
Be careful with my car.

714
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,150
Dude, you gotta learn how to trust me, alright?

715
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:23,120
Alright, you stay here.

716
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,260
Go play minesweeper or something and I'll be right back

717
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,490
Come on, be careful!

718
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,360
So I think we're gonna stay down here and

719
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:37,700
I thought you were just supposed to go down there and

720
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,100
get the deed and then...
Come home?

721
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:44,170
Yeah, that's what I thought too, but this place is

722
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,310
actually kinda trashed, and I think Dave wants to do it

723
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:53,080
yeah, I know, but I haven't seen
him for awhile and we spent a

724
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,150
lot time down here growin' up.

725
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,250
I don't know, I just-
I can't explain it.

726
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,190
You... can't fix a house, Jim.
I'm sorry. You couldn't

727
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:04,730
even fix a drain when it was just clogged with hair.

728
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,130
Yeah, I know. But this place
means a lot to me.

729
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,300
I want to do this we got all our old stuff here.

730
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,570
It should only be a couple days.

731
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,770
Why don't you just hire somebody to do that...?

732
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,810
Dave won't sign the deed unless we do this.

733
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,310
Plus, this is like the last
thing I'll ever do for my dad,

734
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,280
so I want to do it right.

735
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,900
Un-fucking-believable.

736
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,870
Dave, you were gone for three hours and you bought beer

737
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,470
instead of supplies.

738
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,210
What the fuck is wrong with you?

739
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:53,340
Dude, I got a shitload of supplies in the car.

740
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,580
Check it out, man.

741
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,610
What is all this shit?

742
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,910
Party pad.

743
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,650
No, that shirt-that is the
ugliest shirt I've ever seen.

744
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:03,920
I found them outside some like old folks' home, so...

745
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,760
Look, we're not here to make a party pad.

746
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,730
We're here to fix what's broken
and get the fuck out of here.

747
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,630
I've been working all day.
Getting all this stuff.

748
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,270
I need this money, David.

749
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:17,930
You want a cowboy hat?

750
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,670
No, I want this money.

751
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,770
I'm down to fix the house too.

752
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,310
Why can't we have a little fun too?

753
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,370
I see what you're lookin' at.

754
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,610
Guess how much that was.

755
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:26,910
I don't want to.
- Guess.

756
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,550
I don't want to.
- Nine hundred bucks.

757
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,780
You paid nine hundred dollars-?

758
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,950
For virtual cop.
- Yeah, virtual cop two.

759
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,220
There's a certain level of professionalism that

760
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,690
we expect from everyone here.

761
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,790
And that includes our associate professors.

762
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,690
Now, I'm sorry about your father
but it's been over a week-

763
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:44,260
Jim, Jim, Jim.

764
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,600
I'm gonna call you back.

765
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,400
What do you want? What?

766
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,770
They got pretty much everything we need in there, ok?

767
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,470
Supplies-wise.

768
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:54,340
I definitely shoulda came here
first. That one's on me.

769
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,240
Awesome. Let's go.

770
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,240
But uh... bad news is they are
closed for some reason.

771
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,410
I thought they closed at seven, dude?

772
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,980
Maybe... is it like president's
day or something?

773
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,890
Old timey photo place down the street.

774
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,220
I say we head down there, get cowboyed up a little bit,

775
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,290
maybe get some tombstone pics, and have fun.

776
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,930
This whole trips supposed to be
a little bit of renaissance for

777
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,930
a us both, right? Correct?

778
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,400
No, not at all.

779
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,960
I don't see why we can't do both, alright?

780
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:23,600
Fix the house but also have some decent brother time.

781
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,770
Now I say, we take these envelopes we got from

782
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,570
Charbineau. They're full of
coupons and shit for amazing

783
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:31,710
attractions around town, have some fun today.

784
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,810
Then we start fixing the house.

785
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:37,950
No. You can't get
any work done.

786
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,550
The hardware store's closed.
We don't have any supplies.

787
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,250
Work for my job, dummy.

788
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,820
I'm already behind on like seven different things.

789
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,820
We're doing this together.

790
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,820
No we're not, Dave.

791
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:50,530
I'm going back to the house.
Give me my keys.

792
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,030
Now I'm thinking...
What I was saying before...

793
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:58,600
What if you're like Wyatt earp's
like wife who's addicted to

794
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,570
cough syrup. Because I feel
like you're kinda in that

795
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,740
mode right now anyway where you're kinda being a bitch,

796
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,940
and I feel like I'm gonna go a little bit more

797
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,480
of a bill Paxton route.

798
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,810
I feel like you're getting angry right now.

799
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,380
Don't let my jacket touch the ground.

800
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,320
Alright, now we're talking.

801
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,850
Oh, Jim, check this out.

802
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,020
Glug, glug, glub.

803
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,850
Easy there buckaroo.

804
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,320
I'm gonna need to see some ID now before I let you go

805
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,530
drinking up all my swill.

806
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,790
I'm just kidding of course.

807
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,900
My name's grant.

808
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,860
How you doin' grant?

809
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:30,300
Well grant, we both grew up
in Minneapolis matter of fact.

810
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,570
We're brothers.

811
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,340
Ahh, Great Lakes up there.

812
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,940
My son and I drowned a cat up there once.

813
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,370
You don't say?
- That's right.

814
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:42,450
Are looking to get a couple pictures taken.

815
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,010
And I'm thinkin' like third act tombstone.

816
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:49,350
You came to the right place, sir.

817
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,050
Let's get you set up.

818
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,350
Alright.

819
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,130
They better be heavy.

820
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,460
Yum yum, drink up.

821
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,800
We payed ninety bucks for 'em.

822
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,130
These are ninety dollar drinks?

823
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,900
A piece, yeah.

824
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,000
But I mean, they're for like eighteen people.

825
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:49,770
So, have you guys had a chance to look at the menu?

826
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,910
We need like another
minute to-

827
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,110
I think we're good.
I'm gonna do...

828
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,010
Let's do two chicken almond dings.

829
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,910
Um... three of those
window specials.

830
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,580
I saw a guy eating lo mein tacos, but I didn't

831
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,550
yeah, they're on our very special menu.

832
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,220
For very special costumers.

833
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,520
She's already hooking us up.
I like this already.

834
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,860
For drink wise...

835
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:09,030
Other then these, just three Tequila shots,

836
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,130
three orange whips, three beers.

837
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,100
That's it, for right now.

838
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,500
And you?

839
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,700
Oh no, it's for both of us.

840
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,200
We're brothers.
This is my brother.

841
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:17,900
Hi.

842
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,570
Oh hi.

843
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,940
I'm Dave by the way.
I forgot to-so rude.

844
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,070
Oh these are beautiful rings.

845
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,110
Are those mood rings?

846
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,010
I can tell because you look so happy.

847
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,010
And you are?

848
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,080
Jim.

849
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,980
Petra.

850
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,520
You have really nice hands.

851
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,980
I'm actually married so, uh...

852
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,750
Oh, me too.

853
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,150
Hey me too. We're all married.

854
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:38,990
No you're not.

855
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:43,490
I'm gonna get your food order and deal with some other

856
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,700
costumers. I will be back.

857
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,630
Enjoy these drinks.
See you soon.

858
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,230
Thank you, bye.

859
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,240
Dude, what the fuck was that all about?

860
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,970
You talking about being married and shit?

861
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,840
Like she doesn't wanna know-
she didn't ask you that.

862
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,640
She doesn't care about that, ok?

863
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,940
Me and her had a thing going.

864
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,510
You jumped in and tried to get in on it too,

865
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:05,980
Ok, first off, she was flirting with both of us.

866
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,890
No, first off, she was being polite to you.

867
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,950
We had a flirt going, and you,
you kind of snuck in and she

868
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,960
felt kind of obligated because
this is like her job to like

869
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,660
make the costumers happy.

870
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,060
You know that girl's a hooker, right?

871
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,660
Sorry. That was inappropriate.

872
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,000
That just shows what my feelings are.

873
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,300
You talk about a guy's girl like that...

874
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:30,810
I just had no idea that you had such a thing for hookers.

875
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:34,010
She comes to this country from
Russia to try to make a living

876
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,050
for herself and you are
belittling her-

877
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,550
she's totally British.

878
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,320
She's not... I know what
Russian girls sound like.

879
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,820
You are the dumbest person I've ever met.

880
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,190
She's Russian doing a British accent.

881
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:45,150
You think she's a Russian
non-hooker, and

882
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,020
she's a British whore.

883
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,930
Let's just drop it.

884
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,160
She's a whore.

885
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,160
I'll do one for my wife and one for me.

886
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,170
I love facial hair.

887
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,570
Facial hair is so sexy.

888
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:58,270
Right?

889
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,570
Let's do one before I go.

890
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:04,240
I'd grind you up and turn you into a hotdog.

891
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,170
To your wife.

892
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:09,650
I feel like we're really putting
this in progress tonight.

893
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,050
Ebony and ivory go together...

894
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,020
Who am I?

895
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:16,850
Stevie wonder.

896
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,090
Ray Charles.

897
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:20,990
I don't smell like an idiot?
This is Louie ck, man.

898
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:21,890
Yeah?

899
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:22,760
Well. Good shit.

900
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,230
Haha, look at these guys.

901
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:27,160
What, this guy ever make out with a girl before?

902
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,200
Look at him.

903
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,600
He's fumbling around.

904
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,870
Yeah, that's a joke.

905
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,000
She's not that hot.

906
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,240
Yeah, get it buddy.

907
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,200
Yeah.

908
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,740
Grab her ass.

909
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,680
Grab her ass. Finish.

910
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,910
Business in an alley way.

911
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,080
Oww.

912
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,250
What the fuck?

913
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,020
How did a Latino bean and broccoli turtle

914
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,290
end up in branson?

915
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,200
What happened to you?

916
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,960
I just got my ass kicked.

917
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:02,700
I told you that girl was trouble.

918
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,330
It wasn't her.
It was these guys.

919
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,100
Those guys?

920
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,800
Yeah.

921
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,770
Well I guess we should get rid
of your karate trophies 'cuz...

922
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:11,010
Me and my brother need to tell you a secret.

923
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:12,210
Come here real quick.

924
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:14,910
We just want to bury the hatchet.

925
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:15,850
What are you doing, Dave?

926
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:20,350
Jim, we'll figure it out.
We always do.

927
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:21,380
No, we never do.

928
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:24,650
Now, what I don't understand is, if these two guys

929
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:25,920
are from Cleveland,
then where are you-

930
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:33,300
You boys gonna be here a long time.

931
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,980
See that?

932
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,280
Aviator.

933
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,680
That's me.

934
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,720
Flying this ship.

935
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,290
Now pick 'em up.

936
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:00,890
What? No.

937
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,430
That's alright.

938
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:07,960
The point I'm trying to make is, I'm in charge.

939
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:09,070
You understand?

940
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,730
I'm the boss!

941
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,930
Bruce!

942
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,870
Heel.

943
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:18,240
Well, well, well.

944
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,710
I see you met my killer.

945
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:26,150
Y'all be careful, because I say the word, he attacks.

946
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,750
What's the word?

947
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:29,950
Go.

948
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:30,820
Stop.

949
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,120
Did you say it?

950
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,490
Or were you just telling 'em the word?

951
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:35,060
I was telling 'em the word, Bruce.

952
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,330
Alright, 'cuz I just wanted that word.

953
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:37,160
He's anxious.

954
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,330
He's hungry to kill.

955
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:39,430
I want the word.

956
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:42,160
Just like I'm hungry for a snack.

957
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:45,070
Mmm.

958
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,270
He's hungry.

959
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,940
Do you want like a spoon?

960
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:51,940
Huh?

961
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,740
That you can eat with?

962
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:54,840
We got spoons here.

963
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:57,510
I happen to enjoy it oyster style.

964
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,380
Are we actually being charged with anything?

965
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,950
'Cuz legally if you're gonna charge me with something,

966
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,290
you need to present me with a police report.

967
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:08,490
Mm, yeah we got one.

968
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,160
Gonna print out two copies right now.

969
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,260
Oh I don't actually have it.

970
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,230
Well, y'all don't go nowhere.

971
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,130
Bruce and I'll be right back.

972
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:19,800
Donna, can you print out them a police reports?

973
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,440
Yeah.

974
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:25,340
Smart shit with that police report, dude.

975
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,110
Not really. I made it up.

976
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,810
Really?

977
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,250
It sounded real. Do you
think they know that?

978
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,080
I don't know, but we gotta get
out of here as soon as possible,

979
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:35,950
because you've already cost us a day on the house.

980
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,820
Fuck you, give me a fucking break, dude.

981
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,990
Everything I do is just so fucking stupid.

982
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:43,990
And you have, like, so much more
important shit you have to do.

983
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,190
Yeah, I agree.

984
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,260
At least I'm there when people need me.

985
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:48,300
Oh, come on.

986
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,570
I had to drive halfway across
the country to take you to your

987
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:53,470
oh, now you're the fucking hero of the family.

988
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:54,540
You can do whatever the fuck you want.

989
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,140
Call everbody shitheads.

990
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:56,970
That's all I'm saying.

991
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:57,910
Yeah right.

992
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,210
I'm there and you're not.

993
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:00,280
When have I not been there?

994
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,340
A ton of times, like...

995
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,450
That time I went to rehab.

996
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:05,950
Remember? Remember that?

997
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:10,050
I was-I was like-I was having
some problems and you know mom

998
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,250
and dad were there, and a couple
of other people were there,

999
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:15,120
you know, everyone
was there but you. You know?

1000
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:19,460
You had some-you had some kind
of desimination you had to do.

1001
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:23,470
Yeah, and that's like a book report kind of thing.

1002
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,000
It sounds like a really important book report.

1003
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,870
Yeah I've got a fucking
book report to do. Whatever.

1004
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:34,310
The time I got arrested.
Remember when I got arrested?

1005
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,250
Mom and dad were in Europe.

1006
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:38,010
Boy, I got real comfy in that jail cell.

1007
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,550
Nobody came and bailed me out.

1008
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,280
Nobody showed up.

1009
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,390
I was on a writer's fellowship.

1010
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:48,120
I'm-I'm just being
such a shithead. I should

1011
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:50,460
have known that you were on some writer's fellowship...

1012
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,600
I'm sorry I missed all your fucking fork in the road

1013
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,860
moments, Dave, but it looks like there's gonna be a

1014
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:55,970
milion more....

1015
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,300
Well, well, well.

1016
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,000
It ain't looking too good, boys.

1017
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,210
It turns out one of you's got a warrant in Springfield.

1018
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,640
The other hasn't payed taxes in years, so...

1019
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,540
I, I put a call in to the governor to see if I could get

1020
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,950
you extradited, maybe you could
face these charges in the state

1021
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:13,220
without the death penalty...

1022
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,650
My hands are tied.

1023
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:17,150
There ain't much more I can do.
You know-

1024
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:20,260
alright, y'all are free
to go. So, uh...

1025
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,590
Bruce, I thought we were gonna
sweat 'em out a little bit more.

1026
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,560
Yeah.

1027
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,600
Yeah, you guys are-
you guys are...

1028
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,670
Yeah, ok. It's too late Bruce.

1029
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:36,210
Nonetheless though.

1030
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:39,540
You've each been implanted with
a micro chip so I'm gonna be

1031
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,540
monitoring you from here on out.

1032
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:00,600
What are you doing in dad's office?

1033
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,600
Quit dicking around.
No, you're counting change.

1034
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,500
You're stealing change.

1035
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,600
I'm not stealing change.

1036
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,470
Half of that change is mine.

1037
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:11,310
I don't want all the nickles. I
want most of the quarters.

1038
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:13,380
You don't get to have all the quarters.

1039
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:16,150
Come on, we have to go figure out where to start.

1040
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:18,280
I know, I know what we need to do.

1041
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,050
I got this list from Charbineau.

1042
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:22,150
It's got everything we need to do to the house on it.

1043
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,320
You got a list from Charbineau?

1044
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,090
Half this shit we can do today.

1045
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:28,420
Well you seemed like you knew
everything that was going on

1046
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,160
earlier, so...

1047
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,430
We got work to do.

1048
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:41,700
You almost hit me in the face with a hockey puck.

1049
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,730
If I wanted to hit you in the face, I would've

1050
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:43,630
hit you in the face.

1051
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:47,740
Dude, you and me both know the
best work I do is in the crease.

1052
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,770
That's not true. You
weren't ever any good.

1053
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:52,170
Well, if I wasn't any good, why
don't you try and score on me.

1054
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,780
So, if I score on you, you have
to go clean the dock right now.

1055
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,520
Alright, dude, but if I shut you down, you've gotta

1056
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,350
give me that watch.

1057
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:04,390
Also if you get in my crease, I will take you down.

1058
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:05,590
Ok? I'm not gonna
apologize for that.

1059
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:07,620
That's just an instinct, alright?

1060
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:08,720
From years of goal tending.

1061
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:10,260
Number two, do not aim for my throat.

1062
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,230
Oww, I'm not ready yet. Stop!

1063
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:14,530
I'm not ready. I'm not.

1064
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,200
I gotta get set you fuckin' wad.

1065
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,800
'Cuz I just fucking scored, bro.

1066
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,270
Now I'm ready. Try again.

1067
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:23,110
Let's go. This is the
one that counts.

1068
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,580
Nice work, dipshit.

1069
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,750
Ok, that one's coming out of my half.

1070
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,380
They're open, dude. Don't worry.

1071
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:35,850
This guy's selling churros. I
might try and check that out.

1072
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:38,450
But uh, yeah...

1073
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,790
Hey where're you going?

1074
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,560
Welcome to the store.
May I help you?

1075
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,730
Uh yeah.

1076
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,670
Do you have wasp spray?

1077
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:53,340
All of our insecticides are on aisle five.

1078
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,740
Cool, thanks.

1079
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:58,670
You guys still close at three?

1080
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,480
Seven to seven every day, rain or shine.

1081
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,440
What about yesterday?

1082
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,410
Rain or shine. Seven to seven.

1083
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,350
Every day.

1084
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,320
Alright, thanks man.

1085
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,560
Jackpot.

1086
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,630
What's up, what's up?

1087
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:24,200
What are you all mother fucker's doing?

1088
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,740
Ah, I'm just playing. I'm
just playing. What's up?

1089
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:28,840
Wow, divorce?

1090
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,470
Yeah, yuck.

1091
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:34,280
Actually it's not bad 'cuz I'm not miserable now, so...

1092
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,340
Yeah.

1093
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:36,780
You, you have a baby.

1094
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:37,650
I know, right?

1095
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:40,550
Wow. I'm so happy for you.

1096
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:41,750
Jim, you're not going to believe this shit.

1097
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:43,250
Next door, laser tag place?

1098
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,220
Looking for supplies for the house.

1099
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,190
Ended up getting jumped by a
bunch of construction workers.

1100
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:48,190
Can you believe that shit?

1101
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:49,860
Yes, actually I believe it.

1102
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:51,790
Lauren Kennedy, do you remember my brother, Dave.

1103
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,400
Hey. What's up?
- Hi.

1104
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,600
We went to camp together. Her
parents had a trampoline.

1105
00:52:57,570 --> 00:53:00,270
You guys used to bone down, didn't you?

1106
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:01,800
We used to date, yeah.

1107
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:04,240
You did-you took her virginity.
That's fucked up, dude.

1108
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,670
Actually I took his.
For the record.

1109
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,610
Ohhh.

1110
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:11,710
Wait, what happened to you?
You got jumped outside?

1111
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,250
I got like, just got hit by a motorcycle actually.

1112
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,620
It was pretty crazy but I'm totally fine.

1113
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,750
I'm good.

1114
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,360
Out front, yeah. It just clipped
me. But... everbody's Ok.

1115
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,530
Oh my God.

1116
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:25,590
He's an idiot.

1117
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,500
Where are your shoes?

1118
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,600
Oh, lost 'em in the crash.

1119
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,460
That's crazy.

1120
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:29,360
Pop right off.

1121
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:30,430
You didn't go pick 'em up?

1122
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:31,800
I'm fine though.
I'm cool, I'm cool.

1123
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,900
He might be kinda fucked up.

1124
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,300
How long are you guys here for?

1125
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:35,300
A couple days.

1126
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:38,640
Ok, well if you want to catch up more, or whatever...

1127
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,440
Great yeah.

1128
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,740
Nice to see you.

1129
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,410
I did not get jumped.

1130
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:45,310
Bye, nice to see you.
Hope you feel better.

1131
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,850
How many times have you been beat up the last few days?

1132
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,220
You got her number. Help
you get over your wife.

1133
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,790
Uh, I don't need to get over my wife, dummy.

1134
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:56,330
Don't you hate her though, or something?

1135
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:58,560
I'm probably thinking of somebody else.

1136
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,270
Man, it's fun being back down here, right?

1137
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:11,940
Did you lie to me about the hardware store being closed?

1138
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,810
The guy at the counter said that
they were open the other day.

1139
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:18,480
Well maybe that dude was lying,
you ever think about that?

1140
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,420
Dad was always our coach, man.

1141
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,820
Football, baseball, hockey, karate.

1142
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:27,820
Anybody else teaching his kids how to do anything.

1143
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:30,990
Yeah, we gotta find these karate uniforms, dude.

1144
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,930
You really think your old gi's gonna fit you smart guy?

1145
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:36,970
No, I bet dad's will though, you fucking moron.

1146
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:38,970
Uh, you might want to call your
karate association, 'cuz they

1147
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:41,740
might not be cool with you upgrading like that.

1148
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,670
Check this out.

1149
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:43,670
Mystery safe.

1150
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:44,540
Super cool.

1151
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:47,410
I bet this thing is full of bear bonds, dude.

1152
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:52,410
A bear bond-it's like in world
war ii, bears were really rare,

1153
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:55,620
and then like, uh, you could buy like bonds.

1154
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,820
I don't think that's what that is.

1155
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:59,420
I can open this sucker
up, dude. Easy.

1156
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:02,360
See if he can give us a locksmith.

1157
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,760
Dude, then we gotta cut him in, man.

1158
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,530
Actually... I'm not
really used to these.

1159
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,600
Alright, that can come out of my half.

1160
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:36,060
Dave?

1161
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,890
Did you freeze all my shirts?

1162
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:44,930
What are you doing?
Get out of here.

1163
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,570
Is that wild things?

1164
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:47,640
Yeah, get outta here!

1165
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,540
Are you still going?

1166
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,910
Go away. Now!

1167
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:50,870
Are you still going?

1168
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:53,680
Yes, I'm still going. Go away!

1169
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,640
Fucking pervert.

1170
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,410
I just feel like, I feel like
you're gonna break that window.

1171
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,350
I'm not gonna break that window, ok?

1172
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:00,120
It's a tennis ball, ok?

1173
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,450
Don't worry about it.

1174
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:02,820
You throw the ball up.

1175
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,350
I hit the ball, hits the wasp nest, wasp nest falls.

1176
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,690
We run, lock ourselves in the car.

1177
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,990
Pull around, run over the wasp nest with the car.

1178
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,990
Killing the wasps, k?

1179
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:13,060
This seems like a really shitty plan.

1180
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,860
It's not a shitty plan, ok?

1181
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:16,670
I've done this four times, dude.

1182
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:17,600
You've done this four times?

1183
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,100
Yeah.

1184
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:18,970
Did it work?

1185
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:20,470
Yeah, it worked.

1186
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:21,670
Three times.

1187
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:23,410
What happened the fourth time?

1188
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:24,840
Ball guy fucked up.

1189
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,410
So...

1190
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:27,580
Don't screw this up.

1191
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:28,980
Ready?

1192
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:29,710
Yep.

1193
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:33,450
Get ready to run, 'cuz these guys are going to be pissed.

1194
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:44,930
That's coming out of your half.

1195
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:47,800
Fuckin' bat had like pine tar on it, or something.

1196
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:50,130
You did?

1197
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:52,900
That's awesome.

1198
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:55,800
Hold on, hold on.

1199
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:58,110
What are you...? Stop, stop.

1200
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,710
Dude, all I'm saying is-like
irregardless of whether it's a

1201
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,650
good idea or not, you can bet on wrestlemania.

1202
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:10,620
It's just like paying attention to the characters.

1203
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,690
Well, they're not characters.
They're athletes.

1204
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:14,420
Oh, score dude.

1205
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:17,590
Check it out. Surge alert.
Take a rip, dude.

1206
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:18,160
Gross.

1207
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,860
I'll race ya.

1208
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,760
You're gonna get sick.

1209
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:26,030
That's like fifteen years old, and surge is gross anyway.

1210
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,200
These are worth a ton. I
shouldn't of fucking drank that.

1211
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:30,970
You didn't open yours. That was
smart, dude. Profit.

1212
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:33,070
You totally overestimate the collectables market.

1213
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,810
Dude, shit is worth a lot of money.

1214
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:36,950
No, it's not. It's really not.

1215
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:38,450
Oh, shit dude.

1216
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:41,620
This might be a little more your speed.

1217
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:46,660
Oh dude. Super Jack pot.

1218
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,820
What's that?

1219
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:48,760
Party pills.

1220
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,860
These are like tranquilizers.

1221
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,060
Let's get this party started, dude.

1222
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:56,770
Dude, these are for Steve when he got heartworms.

1223
00:57:56,770 --> 00:58:00,200
Yeah, they're tranqs dude.
They're like xanaxs.

1224
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,940
You just gotta take like...

1225
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,670
You gotta get the ratio of like dog to person.

1226
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,740
So like if he needed two, I'll have like twelve.

1227
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:10,950
It's not rocket science, dude.

1228
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:12,950
Yeah, you're right. It's
like actual science.

1229
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,150
You alright, man?

1230
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:18,690
You look fucked up.

1231
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:21,720
I just chugged that surge too fast.

1232
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:24,490
Shit's like fifteen cups of coffee straight to the dong.

1233
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,160
I'm pretty sure it's those dog pills.

1234
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,000
Want me to take you to the vet?

1235
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,230
Uneccessary.

1236
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:31,900
Iron stomache man, I told you.

1237
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:38,270
Oh hey, I got it.

1238
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,910
Check it out. I'm gonna kill
so many fucking wasps.

1239
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:43,180
I'm gonna go kill some, like, churros real quick.

1240
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:43,980
I'll be right back.

1241
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:14,680
Jim, what is taking so long?

1242
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,780
We're fixing a house.

1243
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:16,880
This isn't easy.

1244
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,250
Didn't you say that your dad's business partner had some

1245
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,720
crew that he could hire?

1246
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,820
That's gonna cost like thousands of dollars,

1247
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:26,820
and Dave and I are doing this.
It's like a brother thing...

1248
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:30,090
This isn't an excuse for you to
go run off and, like, live out

1249
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:31,760
your childhood with your brother.

1250
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,830
I'm not reliving my childhood.

1251
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:34,930
I'm doing the best that I can.

1252
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:36,160
I need you do something, Jim.

1253
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:37,700
I need you to take action.

1254
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,600
Like what? What do
you want me to do?

1255
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:43,870
Hire the guys, get the money, and come home.

1256
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:48,310
Yeah, it's right
off seventy-five.

1257
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:51,850
What's up, Big Brother?

1258
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:53,010
Go on a little nature hike?

1259
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:54,650
Yeah I wanted to walk around the lake.

1260
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:58,050
You look like you've had a productive day.

1261
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,320
You fix that screen door.

1262
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,590
I stole a bunch of this screen door stuff from this

1263
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:04,790
country club down the street.

1264
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:11,100
He was like... he said he paid
for all this shit that we broke

1265
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,240
but I don't know what he's talking about there.

1266
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,040
He also said he wanted to take us out to dinner tonight.

1267
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:17,940
And I was like, I don't know about that.

1268
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,040
Sounds kinda weird.

1269
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:22,380
They were giving them away.
Can you believe that?

1270
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,380
Just like some kind of jacket giveaway or something.

1271
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:30,250
There was just like a whole room
of 'em just like racked up,

1272
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:32,620
and I'm like, oh awesome.
I took like five.

1273
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,820
Did you rob a coat room?

1274
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:38,090
Rob a? No man.

1275
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:38,990
Oh dude, check this out.

1276
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,060
That's badass.

1277
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:45,800
I did a bunch while you were gone doing whatever,

1278
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,770
but we got like a ton of work.
I gotta big list.

1279
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:48,740
Is this mine?

1280
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:49,670
That's yours.

1281
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:50,810
This is awesome.

1282
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:52,270
We got two.

1283
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,270
It's like Batman and Robin.

1284
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,940
Suit up.

1285
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:56,650
We gotta lot of work today.

1286
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:58,950
What the fuck is that?

1287
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:00,680
Hold on, we got intruders.

1288
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:01,350
Dave.

1289
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,750
Dave.

1290
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,790
Hey, asshole.

1291
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,320
Dave!

1292
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,160
I'm giving you ten seconds to
get out of my fucking driveway.

1293
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,690
Chill out. Chill out, chill out.

1294
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:18,270
I'm giving you ten seconds to
get your piece of shit truck

1295
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:20,870
out of my driveway, ok?
This is my property.

1296
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:22,300
I was over there. I could
not hear you well.

1297
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:25,210
Get your fuckin' goon squad out of my property.

1298
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:27,880
What is this? What?

1299
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:28,680
He's just joking.

1300
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,280
You are very funny.

1301
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,010
No, I'm not joking.

1302
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:30,880
Are you Jim?

1303
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,250
I'm javier. This is my
associate, Trevor.

1304
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:35,350
I am Ivan.

1305
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:38,990
Why are you, why do you know these guys?

1306
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:40,160
Because I hired 'em.

1307
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,120
For what?

1308
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,760
To fix the fucking house.

1309
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,060
We don't need any help with the fuckin' house.

1310
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:45,460
We need so much help!

1311
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:46,730
There's nothing wrong with it.

1312
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:48,100
We have no idea what we're doing.

1313
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,700
We just gotta-branches.

1314
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,170
It's not branches.

1315
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:52,230
We don't need four guys...

1316
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,070
You should put him in a birdcage.

1317
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:58,110
So he can keep chirping to his heart's delite.

1318
01:01:58,110 --> 01:01:59,870
I got two chirps for you, ok?

1319
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,910
One of them's gonna be me hitting you.

1320
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:05,750
The other chirp's gonna be me kicking him in the dick.

1321
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:06,310
What about me.

1322
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,220
I'm still here.

1323
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,150
Nah, it's not worth it.

1324
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,080
Not even worth it, slim.

1325
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:10,020
You want to hit me?

1326
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:10,990
He doesn't want to hit you.

1327
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:11,990
Get the fuck out of here.

1328
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:13,390
Get in the fucking truck-

1329
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:14,860
how 'bout I slap your face?

1330
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:15,920
How 'bout you fucking try it?

1331
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,490
Listen, we're doing you a favor.

1332
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:24,430
Woah, hey.

1333
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,800
Can I talk to you inside for a second?

1334
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,900
Charbineau got this guy to give us a hell of a deal

1335
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:33,510
I'm so fucking sick of your cut and run bullshit, dude.

1336
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:35,910
You're taking something that's so awesome and special and

1337
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:37,380
you're just fucking ruining it and I don't know why.

1338
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:38,110
I'm ruining it?

1339
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:43,080
On purpose. Ok?
This guy on the other hand,

1340
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,790
can have us home within a week, checks in hand.

1341
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:46,520
I don't care about that.

1342
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:49,520
I don't trust this guy.
I don't trust Charbineau.

1343
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:51,490
You know what, you're on the chopping block too, buddy.

1344
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,360
Why do you have to make things so much more difficult?

1345
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,530
Oh here comes Tim the tool man Taylor now.

1346
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:57,800
You come to chirp with us, my little bird?

1347
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:00,140
Dave?

1348
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:01,170
You got iced out.

1349
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,070
Ooh, I feel bad.

1350
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:06,840
What the fuck is going on, man?

1351
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:07,940
Huh?

1352
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:09,080
Hey.

1353
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,210
Look at him in his piece of shit car.

1354
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:12,250
That's my car.

1355
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:14,080
It's a piece of shit.

1356
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,080
Woah, come on. Watch it.

1357
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,080
Oh.

1358
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,620
Hey, do you know where Petra is?

1359
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:54,880
I'm sorry, what?

1360
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,320
Do you where Petra is?

1361
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,220
I understand English.

1362
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:02,060
Are your pants on backwards?

1363
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:05,360
No, my pants aren't... oh,
maybe, yeah. I drove here.

1364
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,060
Why do you drive with pants on backwards?

1365
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:08,360
I don't drive with my pants on backwards.

1366
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:09,600
I drive with no pants.

1367
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,570
It's this thing my dad taught me.

1368
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:11,330
You wouldn't understand.

1369
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:12,170
Do you work here?

1370
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:13,970
Yes, but I just got off.

1371
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:18,040
Yes, but why do you want her and not me.

1372
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,340
What are you talking-
why would I want-?

1373
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:20,380
Listen, I just met you.

1374
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:21,210
Is that a joint?

1375
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:22,580
No.

1376
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:25,010
Can you get a joint?

1377
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:27,280
All I'm saying is if you're gonna hire a bunch of guys

1378
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,690
talk to me about it first, ok?
Why's that so hard.

1379
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:31,590
I'm a grown up.

1380
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:33,990
If you got a problem, let's talk about it.

1381
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:36,590
Why don't you just apologize to
him and tell him all the things

1382
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:38,260
you're telling me?

1383
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:39,430
It's not that easy, lady.

1384
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:40,560
Why not?

1385
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,030
Is it because you're a man?

1386
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:46,100
No, it's because we're brothers
and we're super competitive.

1387
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:48,000
We've been fighting our whole lives.

1388
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,270
I'm smarter than he is and I
think he's starting to realize

1389
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:53,040
that, and that's pissing him off real bad.

1390
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,040
You wouldn't understand.

1391
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,440
Why would I not understand?

1392
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:58,080
Wait, is Petra one of your sisters?

1393
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:01,280
What-what is this
with you and Petra?

1394
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:05,190
You know, I can do whatever it
is that you like that she does.

1395
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:07,420
Don't worry about it.
Just, where is Petra?

1396
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,690
I don't know. In Mr.
Charbineau's restaurant.

1397
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:11,030
Is that Mr. Charbineau?

1398
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:12,460
Hey, that guy is supposed to be our guy.

1399
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:14,060
You get worked up very easily.

1400
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:15,700
Does everybody in this fucking town know each other?

1401
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:18,070
Everybody knows Mr.
Charbineau, you know?

1402
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:20,170
You said he's at a restaurant?

1403
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:26,270
Oh, you're on time.

1404
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,510
Alright, lay down eight times on the redskins.

1405
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:31,350
Gotta call, bye.

1406
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:35,520
So, what's up?

1407
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,750
You look sad.

1408
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,120
I got a lot to be sad about.

1409
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:39,620
Do you?

1410
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,620
Yep.

1411
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:43,020
You know, when I feel that way...

1412
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,030
Two things you have to remember.

1413
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:53,270
Know how to party.
Know how to forgive.

1414
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:58,240
Honestly, John, that's the worst
advice anyone's ever given me.

1415
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:02,380
That's what I thought when your father told it to me.

1416
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:04,650
Now I have a surprise for you.

1417
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:06,510
I want you to meet your dad's old gang.

1418
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:12,390
Not like I'm gonna pop a cap in your ass, it's more like

1419
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:16,790
legitimate business associates.

1420
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:18,560
Ah, alright.

1421
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:22,660
The guy cheating at cards, that's Jimmy two tone.

1422
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:26,230
Nicky mo, and this is
Mr. ballbuster himself.

1423
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,370
Who is this?

1424
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:30,100
Who is this? Who is this?

1425
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:31,240
No, who is this?

1426
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,310
Look at the face.

1427
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:33,410
Right, right.

1428
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:39,310
And the apple is the bread.

1429
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:42,780
And that is how you make a fruit sandwich.

1430
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:49,790
Him I think you know. Ivan!

1431
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:51,730
Gustovia, huh.

1432
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:00,300
Remember, party, forgiveness.

1433
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:06,240
Pretty good. Hey Ivan, I just
want to apologize for

1434
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,540
oh no, no, no.
No apologies necessary.

1435
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:10,710
No, no, no.

1436
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:12,180
You are in the clear, my friend.

1437
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:17,550
Here's to my new best friend, Jim.

1438
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:19,290
Jim!

1439
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:22,560
Happy Birthday, Jim!

1440
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,720
Happy Birthday.

1441
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:24,690
It's not my birthday.

1442
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:25,760
That's my brother.

1443
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,330
Is it your birthday?

1444
01:08:28,330 --> 01:08:30,400
I don't know.

1445
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:35,500
I recently saw that movie Alice in wonderland, and they

1446
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:39,840
celebrate every day it is not their birthday.

1447
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:42,780
I see that movie and I say that
is going to be my life now,

1448
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:44,110
so...

1449
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:49,720
Hey!

1450
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:53,250
How do I do it compared to you?
Hey!

1451
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:56,620
I can do-I can do any voice.

1452
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:59,590
Name a celebrity. Name one.

1453
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:03,630
Let's get a bottle of renyaki for my friends here.

1454
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:06,130
I'd love to stay for a drink.

1455
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,500
So stay.

1456
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,640
American style.

1457
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,810
Let's tear down the walls.

1458
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:13,880
Let's tear down the walls, Jim.

1459
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,380
I've never shotgunned a beer before.

1460
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:17,710
I've shotgunned other things.

1461
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:19,580
Ahhh.

1462
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,150
Other things.

1463
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:23,450
Like a fucking person.

1464
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:29,220
I've never killed anyone.

1465
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,560
Dave, can I talk to you outside for a second?

1466
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,330
I'll go outside with you, but I'm going back in, ok?

1467
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,400
I'll be right back, alright?

1468
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,670
Yes, yes, yes.

1469
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:39,730
You'll be write back.

1470
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,300
Get the renyakis going.

1471
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,470
You better be ready when I get back.

1472
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,840
We're shotgunning beers when I come back.

1473
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:47,280
You come back or I'll fucking kill you.

1474
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:51,710
I'm not joking, I'm not joking.

1475
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:53,280
If he doesn't come back, we kill him.

1476
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,620
Yeah, for sure.

1477
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,750
Petra's friend brought me to meet with Charbineau.

1478
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:59,720
Fucking Charbineau brought me.

1479
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,220
He brought-oh Ok, sent
me a letter, brings you. Ok.

1480
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:03,260
He set this up. I got it.

1481
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:05,190
Very cool, very cool.

1482
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:05,730
Let's head back in.

1483
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:07,660
Wait, wait, wait.

1484
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:11,970
I just want to say, uh, I'm
sorry for, uh, going behind your

1485
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:13,940
back and hiring those guys.

1486
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:16,440
Like, we said it was going to be like a brother project.

1487
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,570
I should've consulted with you.

1488
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:23,980
Plan's not going as smoothly
as I kinda talked it up to be.

1489
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:26,850
And maybe tomorrow I'll get some
fresh eyes on those blueprints.

1490
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:29,980
Maybe skim them, cut the-
trim the fat a little bit.

1491
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:32,720
I really think we should consider hiring these guys.

1492
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:33,590
You want to hire these guys?

1493
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:37,730
They know less about building houses than me or you, k?

1494
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:38,960
I don't think that's possible.

1495
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,630
Dude, I got an idea.

1496
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:43,600
Me and you head back in there, brother style.

1497
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,500
We pull some Charbineau CIA
mindgame shit on them, let them

1498
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,910
bring their guard down, maybe we cut a deal with them...

1499
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:53,710
Dave, I think if we're gonna
accomplish this goal, like you

1500
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:55,440
and I need to be like super responsible.

1501
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:56,310
I agree.

1502
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:57,010
Extremely responsible.

1503
01:10:57,010 --> 01:10:59,780
So let's get in there and butter 'em up.

1504
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:01,980
I'm not going in there.

1505
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:04,620
You know what, this is a good idea.

1506
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:07,320
You go home, guard the house.

1507
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,490
I'm gonna go in here, pull a little covert op.

1508
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:12,730
Get them real drunk and then we
really find out what they're-

1509
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:14,960
you know, see their whole hand.

1510
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,000
You've got a secondary
initiative going. I like it.

1511
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,330
I'm not going to do anything dumb, ok?

1512
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:21,440
Uh, really?

1513
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,640
I'm-I'm gonna do good cop.

1514
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,040
Nope.

1515
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:50,430
Lobster time!

1516
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,400
Ahh!

1517
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,810
U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A.

1518
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,880
Ahh!

1519
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,580
Dave worked there for
twenty-four hours then it

1520
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:11,820
burned down. Total
coincidence he swears.

1521
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:15,420
Seems like he's doing Ok with everything, though?

1522
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:17,760
Uh, I don't know.

1523
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,530
Like...

1524
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:24,330
Sometimes I feel like he doesn't
care about anything, and then

1525
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:26,830
every once in awhile I think he's...

1526
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:33,110
There's like a-there's like
a thread of, like, normal.

1527
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:37,350
And then it's like, it's as if
he catches me noticing that,

1528
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:40,580
and he goes right back to being a weird robot asshole.

1529
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:42,720
It's probably a defense mechanism.

1530
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,950
But, like, that's a stupid thing to do.

1531
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:51,630
Like, at first it's like, oh
yeah, you know let's help him

1532
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:54,530
out, but then it just gets fucking old after awhile.

1533
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:55,860
But what about you and your dad?

1534
01:12:55,870 --> 01:12:57,630
Why didn't you guys stay close?

1535
01:12:57,630 --> 01:13:00,470
Did Dave like tear apart your family or something?

1536
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:01,070
No.

1537
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:04,710
That's one of the only things Dave didn't ruin.

1538
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:06,570
If anything he kept us closer.

1539
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,920
You know half this house is mine?

1540
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:17,650
Half of this arcade machine is mine, too.

1541
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:19,620
I like this arcade machine.

1542
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:20,720
I like it too.

1543
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,760
Hey Ivan.

1544
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:25,630
Are you just talking to her,
or are you talking to me too?

1545
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:27,600
I was talking to her, but if you want to hang out...

1546
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,730
Well I'm not here?

1547
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:29,530
No, you're here.

1548
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:30,870
Course you're here.

1549
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,140
Uh, guys.

1550
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:39,440
Hey, hey, no, not.

1551
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,680
On my party porch, you kiss me.

1552
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:43,010
And that's how it is, ok?

1553
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:44,810
What? I kiss you the
fuck I like.

1554
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:47,050
You know what, I'll kiss whoever the fuck I want too.

1555
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:49,950
Mm. Mmm.

1556
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:50,790
How do you like that?

1557
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:54,890
Break the fucking thing up.
You don't kiss anyone, ok?

1558
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:56,020
Oh oh oh.

1559
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:57,930
You kiss me. That is it.

1560
01:13:57,930 --> 01:14:00,930
Hold on miss commi salami.

1561
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:02,760
I'm the only one around
here-what is that?

1562
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:05,530
I'm the only one allowed to have a gun around here.

1563
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:10,740
Hey Bruce, you got any bullet proof vests we can

1564
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:11,870
fuck around with?

1565
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:21,580
Dave?

1566
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:23,780
Dave!

1567
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:25,050
Dave?

1568
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:33,030
We're under attack.

1569
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:33,930
I think it's that Russian guy.

1570
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:37,800
He's gonna tear down the whole fucking house, man.

1571
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,870
He's trying to tear down the house.

1572
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:42,570
He's got a bulldozer.

1573
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:44,670
They're not tearing it down.
They're fixing it up, dude.

1574
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:49,080
I got Ivan to fucking hook us
up with his crew last night, ok?

1575
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,580
It's all taken care of.
It's all cool.

1576
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:54,010
Are you sure?

1577
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:55,250
Yeah, I'm sure.

1578
01:14:58,790 --> 01:15:02,060
Can we talk about waking somebody up by smashing, like,

1579
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:04,930
a fucking boat next to them or whatever you did?

1580
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:06,790
Is she breathing?

1581
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:07,600
I don't know.

1582
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,630
Check her pulse?

1583
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:09,760
No, you check her pulse.

1584
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:11,100
She's your fucking girlfriend.

1585
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:11,970
She say that?

1586
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:12,870
No.

1587
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:14,540
Alright, I'll do it.

1588
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:17,840
You up?

1589
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,710
Wake up.

1590
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:19,710
Baby, wake up.

1591
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:21,210
Get up!

1592
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:22,910
C'mon babe.

1593
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:25,550
There she is. See, she's fine.

1594
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:29,780
Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off.

1595
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:33,820
You man, sparky, come here.

1596
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:37,830
Get this fucking chain and throw it.

1597
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:39,660
If you're doing, like, the
fucking thing where it's like a

1598
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,200
different state so it doesn't
count, that only works if you

1599
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,760
went down on her.

1600
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:44,770
Oh we got company.

1601
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:45,730
Hey John.

1602
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:46,670
What are you doin' here?

1603
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:50,100
Oh, it was Edgar's idea.

1604
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:52,540
Wanted to stretch his paws.
Thought we'd drop by.

1605
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:53,140
Edgar?

1606
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:54,910
My cat.

1607
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:58,810
Shit.

1608
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:01,320
Oh well.

1609
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,750
Well, well, well.

1610
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:04,290
Not too bad, huh?

1611
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:09,090
If your father were alive he'd be very proud of you.

1612
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:13,760
Very proud of you.

1613
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:15,630
I appreciate that.

1614
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:17,930
Um, it's actually mostly Dave.

1615
01:16:17,930 --> 01:16:18,830
Is that a fact?

1616
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:20,000
Surprising, right?

1617
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,970
Well played, well played.

1618
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:23,770
Thank you, John.

1619
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:26,840
So I guess the boys will do the work, and you can

1620
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:27,840
get on with your lives now?

1621
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:32,150
No, no, no. I work with these
boys all the time.

1622
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:37,120
With all due respect, the only thing that could go wrong

1623
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,750
is if you hung around.

1624
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:42,290
I'm just sayin' me and you have something that we

1625
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:43,720
need to finish here.
- No we don't, Dave.

1626
01:16:43,730 --> 01:16:45,130
Jim, can I talk to you outside for a second?

1627
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:46,090
Dave, we are outside for a second.

1628
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,900
I feel like you're kinda cuttin'
and runnin' here, and you know?

1629
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,700
Real quick-real
quick brother session?

1630
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:53,100
Ok. Alright.

1631
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,800
What the fuck are you doing?
The house isn't done yet.

1632
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,740
Yeah-we came down
to finish the house.

1633
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:58,070
The house is finished for us.

1634
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:59,670
It's not finished until-
we're getting our checks.

1635
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,140
We'll put a pin in this for now, ok?

1636
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:02,940
But I need to finish talking to you about this.

1637
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:04,610
Arlight, pleasure during business with ya.

1638
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:05,310
You too.

1639
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:06,080
Hey, John.

1640
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:13,090
Um, I just wanted to thank you
for, uh, for everything that

1641
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:14,920
you've done for us.

1642
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:17,930
Work on your goodbye speech.

1643
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:21,000
Sign the deed, get the checks.
Ciao.

1644
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:25,230
Who wants some fucking lunch, man?

1645
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:28,740
Holy shit.

1646
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:44,180
Dude, what is that thing?

1647
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:46,720
Harpsochord?

1648
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,860
Michelle brought it back from Africa for me.

1649
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:50,360
Cool, she just brought back one?

1650
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:54,830
Yeah. Just one.

1651
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:57,730
There's like an owl up there I've been trying to hit

1652
01:17:57,730 --> 01:17:59,370
for like a half an hour.

1653
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:04,770
You remember when
we were kids... and uh...

1654
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:07,110
Dad would always just try and get us to help out

1655
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:11,010
we would always figure out
someway to either get out of it

1656
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:13,210
yes. Do it wrong.

1657
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:14,280
Destroy it.

1658
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,050
He kept askin' though.

1659
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:17,750
I'll fucking give him that, dude.

1660
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:19,090
He was a tenacious fucking guy.

1661
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:21,360
He just wanted to teach, man.

1662
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,420
I remember when he, uh...

1663
01:18:24,330 --> 01:18:26,860
We made that rock tumbler out of the washing machine.

1664
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:29,400
Try to fix it with
the, uh-lawn mower.

1665
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,760
Lawn mower, yeah.

1666
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:32,130
Yeah.

1667
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:34,230
He was pissed, but he still tried to show us how

1668
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,070
to put it back together.

1669
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:40,410
Am I just taking you to the airport, or what?

1670
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:42,180
I don't think so, man.

1671
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:43,040
What?

1672
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:45,410
What are you going to do?

1673
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:46,910
I'm thinkin' about just stayin'.

1674
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,890
Staying where?

1675
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:55,890
Uh, here.

1676
01:18:55,890 --> 01:18:57,320
Like staying here.

1677
01:18:57,330 --> 01:18:59,160
Like in branson?

1678
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,130
Like at this house.

1679
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:11,140
We kinda-like we
got a plan, Dave.

1680
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:14,040
We're supposed to go pick up our
checks from Charbineau tomorrow

1681
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,140
and sign the deeds.

1682
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:16,210
I mean, you can still do that.

1683
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,380
I'm just sayin' that...

1684
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:22,080
I'm probably gonna sit that one out, you know.

1685
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,450
I mean I haven't found my basketball cards.

1686
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:29,520
I haven't found my karate trophies, you know?

1687
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:31,330
They're not even done with the house really.

1688
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:32,890
I feel like...

1689
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:35,000
I just feel that you could buy-
you could buy

1690
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,070
new versions of those. You could
buy all the basket ball

1691
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:39,770
cards you want. All the-yeah.

1692
01:19:39,770 --> 01:19:42,770
You could become a great karate guy.

1693
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:45,240
I feel like I already did it.
I already got the trophies.

1694
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,040
Just find the trophies.
That's all I need.

1695
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:50,910
And I mean, I can buy basketball
cards, but why buy something-

1696
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:53,010
you could buy-you could buy a
lot of stuff I mean, this is-

1697
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:55,020
I mean we're gonna make a lot of money with this thing.

1698
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:59,190
But it's not the same thing. I
mean this place has got

1699
01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:00,850
the memories though, you know?

1700
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:02,420
You can't buy those.

1701
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:10,200
You kinda like go out and meet
new people, make new memories.

1702
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,030
And half of it's mine,
so I figured-

1703
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:14,800
yeah, but you can't sell half a house.

1704
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,440
Eh, that kind of sounds like a Jim problem thing.

1705
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:23,910
I know that's what it sounds like.

1706
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:25,580
I does sound like it, because that's what's happening.

1707
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:27,410
But I feel like, you're
kinda fucking me by-

1708
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:29,080
you can't stay in branson the rest of your life because

1709
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,420
you want to fuck some British
hooker. Alright, man?

1710
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:35,860
Dude, she is definitely fucking British, and she is

1711
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:37,320
definitely a hooker, and you're definitely acting like

1712
01:20:37,330 --> 01:20:39,130
a fucking idiot right now.

1713
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:40,460
I'm not a fucking idiot, man!

1714
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:43,260
Yeah, you are a fucking idiot.

1715
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:45,330
What did I tell you?

1716
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:46,900
Why does it have to be so difficult all the time?

1717
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,870
Because my life is fucking difficult, Jim.

1718
01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:50,200
Why don't you understand that?

1719
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:54,240
The only different is, I don't cry about it all the time.

1720
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:57,580
I fucking set goals and follow through with them.

1721
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:59,910
I don't bail at the fucking last minute.

1722
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,480
Go somewhere, Dave.
Fucking do something!

1723
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:04,450
Back to the fucking Indian reservation where I lived

1724
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:06,420
in a fucking teepee?

1725
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:08,420
Or back to mom's basement, ok?

1726
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:12,060
You have as many opportunities as everyone else.

1727
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:14,190
You don't fucking know me. You
don't know anything about me.

1728
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,930
You don't see these things because you walk around with

1729
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:17,030
your fucking eyes closed all the time.

1730
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:22,040
And you just sit and you bitch
and moan and-

1731
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:25,110
I work for that! I worked for
everything I've had.

1732
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:26,310
You don't work.

1733
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:27,940
You don't fucking try, David.

1734
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:29,580
I've worked at a lot of shit, ok?

1735
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:31,580
And sometimes that shit doesn't work out, ok?

1736
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:38,450
I knocked my fucking girlfriend up in college.

1737
01:21:38,450 --> 01:21:39,520
So, you know what I did?

1738
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,620
I married her.

1739
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,660
I manned up and I married her.

1740
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:44,390
And I took a shitty job
that I hate-

1741
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:48,530
oh that sucks. My wife loves me
too much, and I have-

1742
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:52,330
and awesome job and a car and I write books all the time.

1743
01:21:52,330 --> 01:21:54,300
Oh my God, give me a fucking break.

1744
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,000
Our house is on fire.

1745
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Oh shit.
- Fuck.

1746
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:56,900
Do something!

1747
01:21:56,910 --> 01:21:58,210
Dave, that's not gonna help.

1748
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:00,570
Oh shit, what do we do?!

1749
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:02,340
Dave, we gotta get out of here.

1750
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:04,140
No, this is all I have.

1751
01:22:04,150 --> 01:22:05,050
This is all I got.

1752
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:08,620
This is all I got.
I can't bail. Alright?

1753
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:11,050
I'm not bailin'. I'm stayin'.

1754
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:14,120
Fine. Me neither.

1755
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:18,930
You stay, I stay.

1756
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:21,090
I'm not gonna bail on you, Dave.

1757
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:22,600
Dave.

1758
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:24,330
Fuck.

1759
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:26,430
No, no.

1760
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:05,210
Woah. Cook out gone wrong?

1761
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:10,080
Have you ever had the chicken parmatorissie?

1762
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,680
No.

1763
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,580
Oh boy.

1764
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:16,380
Alright, have a seat.
I'm all ears.

1765
01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:28,130
So...

1766
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:30,660
Here's what happened.

1767
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:35,170
As far as I can remember, we were on the deck.

1768
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:39,770
We were playing with some fireworks.

1769
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:44,410
And uh, I'm gonna go ahead and admit that we

1770
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:46,210
were drinking some whiskey.

1771
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,580
John, we burned the house down.

1772
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:51,320
We burned the whole fucking house to the ground.

1773
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:54,090
It's fucking-nothing's
there anymore.

1774
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:55,660
And it was an accident.

1775
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:58,690
And if there's anyway we can
salvage any kind of value from

1776
01:23:58,690 --> 01:24:02,560
the property, I'd like to have Jim to have it,

1777
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,470
if that's possible.

1778
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:07,670
John, do you understand what I'm saying?

1779
01:24:07,670 --> 01:24:08,700
The house is fucking gone.

1780
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:10,140
There's nothing left.

1781
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:11,200
It's burned to the ground.

1782
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:12,240
We burned the house down.

1783
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:13,510
I know.

1784
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:15,280
What?

1785
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,340
I said I know.

1786
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:21,350
You think houses burn down here all the time?

1787
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:29,560
Ok? Um...

1788
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,820
Now what?

1789
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:36,700
Take the checks.

1790
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,270
You're on your way.

1791
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:45,270
I'm uh... I'm confused.

1792
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:47,310
You think I didn't take our insurance policy the minute

1793
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:48,510
you two bozos showed up?

1794
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:54,080
I was gonna demolish the thing anyway.

1795
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:57,180
Now, you actually got me a buck with the insurance claim.

1796
01:24:57,190 --> 01:25:00,490
John, why did you have us fix the house?

1797
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:03,790
We almost killed each other,
man. What is wrong with you?

1798
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:05,760
Yeah, well...

1799
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:11,500
I just felt it somethin' you're dad woulda wanted.

1800
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:16,600
Besides we don't get too much
action around here, so it was

1801
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:18,240
nice to have you about.

1802
01:25:19,170 --> 01:25:20,540
You motherfucker!

1803
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:22,410
I'll show you action, John.

1804
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:25,450
I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool.

1805
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:27,580
You piece of shit.

1806
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:33,390
I grabbed this stuff when your dad passed.

1807
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:36,260
I was gonna mail it to you if you hadn't shown up.

1808
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:38,530
Some cards in there.

1809
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,900
Boys, do me a favor.

1810
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:47,430
Don't spend it all in one place.

1811
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:51,200
You already have everything you need.

1812
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:53,370
You just don't know it yet.

1813
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:15,860
So, what's your next move, man?

1814
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:18,900
Thinking about opening up my own
dojo. That'd be cool.

1815
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:21,670
Really? Can you do that
as a green belt?

1816
01:26:21,670 --> 01:26:24,740
Yeah, a lot of people don't
know this, in judo, green belt's

1817
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:26,510
actually higher than black.

1818
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:27,340
Really? I've never heard that.

1819
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:29,310
Yeah, it's true.

1820
01:26:31,410 --> 01:26:32,850
You gonna be Ok, Dave?

1821
01:26:32,850 --> 01:26:35,720
Me? Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.
You gonna be Ok?

1822
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:37,420
Yeah, I think so.

1823
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:40,520
Good.

1824
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,890
Oh fuck, check this out.

1825
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:48,460
Ah, dude, are you kidding me?

1826
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:49,530
Where'd you find these?

1827
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:52,200
I was gonna chop them up with an axe but...

1828
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,270
I figured I owed you one.

1829
01:26:54,270 --> 01:26:57,200
Oh man, that's an extra ten grand right there.

1830
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:58,310
Yep.

1831
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:00,370
Thanks, Jim.

1832
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:01,740
Awesome.

1833
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:04,640
Man.

1834
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:10,250
How 'bout that watch, huh?

1835
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:13,620
Alright, ok. See you later.

1836
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:17,820
I'm trying to give you a hug, you fucking asshole.

1837
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:18,790
No you're not.

1838
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:23,300
Ow, you're fucking dead.

1839
01:27:26,370 --> 01:27:27,700
Why don't you use your karate moves, dude?

1840
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:28,870
Fuck you.
