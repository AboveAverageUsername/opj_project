3
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,697
Hey, wire.

4
00:02:07,768 --> 00:02:09,463
Wire. They've drawn
a fence across there.

5
00:02:09,537 --> 00:02:12,028
Them plow-pushers must have
put it up there last night.

6
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:14,165
Give me them wire cutters.

7
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:25,874
I'll fix this.

8
00:02:33,593 --> 00:02:34,958
Cow herders!

9
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,698
Hey, cornhuskers!

10
00:03:35,353 --> 00:03:38,187
Shad Wilkins, you've been
tried and found guilty

11
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:41,226
of the most serious
crime west of the Pecos,

12
00:03:41,293 --> 00:03:43,124
to wit, shooting a steer.

13
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:47,355
Got anything to say for yourself before
the sentence of the court is executed?

14
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:49,262
I told you they shot at me first!

15
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,097
I didn't mean to kill
that steer on purpose!

16
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:52,658
I was aiming at the man.

17
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:56,798
It's your bad luck you missed him.
That's the trouble with you sodbusters,

18
00:03:56,874 --> 00:03:58,933
you can't shoot straight.

19
00:04:01,346 --> 00:04:02,471
Shad,

20
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:07,147
may the Lord have
mercy on your soul. Hey!

21
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,254
Buck, I want to see you.

22
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,101
Well, how's the hanging, there?

23
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:39,373
Well, his neck didn't
hardly stretch a foot.

24
00:04:46,656 --> 00:04:49,318
Here's to the greatest
woman in the world,

25
00:04:49,392 --> 00:04:52,725
the fairest flower that ever bloomed,

26
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:54,821
- Lily Langtry.
- Miss Langtry.

27
00:04:54,898 --> 00:04:56,593
Hold it, boys.

28
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:02,094
Did you hear the toast, stranger?

29
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:03,934
To Lily Langtry? I thought
you meant your friends.

30
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:05,701
I didn't know that included me.

31
00:05:05,774 --> 00:05:08,504
That includes every man
that drinks at my bar.

32
00:05:08,577 --> 00:05:12,878
Glad to join you. Have
you ever met Miss Langtry?

33
00:05:12,982 --> 00:05:17,077
No, I never met her. I never met the
sun, I never shook hands with the moon,

34
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:19,143
and I've never been
introduced to no clouds.

35
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:24,623
That's all right. Too bad Lily
Langtry couldn't have heard that.

36
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:26,058
Did you ever see her?

37
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:29,585
No, I was in England once,
but didn't get around to it.

38
00:05:29,932 --> 00:05:33,163
Oh, you was in England once,
and you could have seen her,

39
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:35,533
- but you never got around to it, eh?
- Yeah.

40
00:05:37,272 --> 00:05:39,137
- Get out of my bar.
- Huh?

41
00:05:39,274 --> 00:05:41,207
Get out of my bar!

42
00:05:42,511 --> 00:05:44,740
- To the Jersey Lily. Miss Langtry.

43
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,370
Here's how.

44
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:22,041
All right, Mort, if Shad's
good and cold, you can have him.

45
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,820
$4, that's all he had. I'll make
it up to you on the next one.

46
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,284
Get off.

47
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,666
- What you got there?
- A horse thief, Judge.

48
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,002
Prisoner of the bar.

49
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,440
- Get in there.
Chickenfoot, the law.

50
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:28,571
Hear ye, hear ye, court of
Vinegarroon is now in session.

51
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:29,739
What's the charge?

52
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:32,477
We caught him on Chickenfoot's
horse that was stole last week.

53
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:35,610
- My horse Pete? Where's he at?
- Right outside.

54
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:43,627
Well, so it is. Pete.

55
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,697
No, Your Honor. I was just
trying to get the lay of the land.

56
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:51,463
- You will, too, at the end of a rope.
- Southeast, no anticipating.

57
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:55,768
Hey, Judge! Judge, that is my old
sabino pony. He's tied right out there.

58
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,937
People of Vinegarroon again...
You can use any name you like.

59
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:03,139
Cole Harden.

60
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:04,875
What are you doing in Vinegarroon?

61
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,111
- Oh, just passing through.
- Homesteader?

62
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:13,683
- No. Where do you hail from?

63
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:18,087
- No place in particular.
Where are you heading for?

64
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:21,460
- No place special.
- Oh, saddle bum, huh?

65
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:25,703
Well, it's all right to live on
a horse if it's your own horse.

66
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,898
Bart, turn loose the prisoner's
hands. Chickenfoot, swear him in.

67
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:31,406
Do you swear to tell
the truth... So help you?

68
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:33,136
Take off your hat!

69
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:51,157
Well, now, I'll tell you, son...

70
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:52,453
Are you Bean?

71
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:55,588
- Judge Roy W. Bean.
- My name's Jane Ellen Mathews.

72
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,396
Yes, Miss Mathews,
what can I do for you?

73
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:01,403
- What have you done with
Shad Wilkins? - Shad Wilkins?

74
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:02,471
He was working in the fields

75
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:05,200
when some of your wranglers
came up and took him away.

76
00:09:05,274 --> 00:09:09,473
Shad Wilkins. Shad Wilkins.

77
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:15,711
Oh, yeah, he was hanging around out there
a while back, but he ain't around now.

78
00:09:16,018 --> 00:09:18,782
Your men not only took him away,
but they tore down the fence.

79
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:20,617
Not a stick of it was left standing.

80
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,714
That so?

81
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,726
Yes, that's so, and you needn't
pretend you don't know about it.

82
00:09:24,794 --> 00:09:26,887
Well, it don't surprise me none.

83
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:28,828
It's against the law to
build fences hereabouts.

84
00:09:28,898 --> 00:09:31,423
- What law? Whose law?
- Mine.

85
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,366
- Now, you listen to me, Mr. Bean.
- Judge Bean.

86
00:09:34,436 --> 00:09:38,237
You're no more a judge than I
am. Just call yourself a judge.

87
00:09:38,374 --> 00:09:41,866
I wouldn't say that if I was you. I
might consider it contempt of court.

88
00:09:41,944 --> 00:09:44,878
It's contempt, all right.
You call this a court?

89
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:48,382
I do, and it happens to
be in session right now.

90
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:50,918
Southeast, get the
young lady a chair.

91
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:54,820
Now, you sit down, Miss Mathews, and
I'll tend to your case in a minute.

92
00:09:55,991 --> 00:09:58,756
You're charged with stealing
a horse. Guilty or not guilty?

93
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:00,294
Not guilty.

94
00:10:00,363 --> 00:10:02,387
Where's exhibit A?
- Huh?

95
00:10:02,464 --> 00:10:04,364
Where's the horse? Bring
in the horse, Chickenfoot.

96
00:10:04,432 --> 00:10:06,730
Oh, yeah. Yeah, horse.

97
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:10,934
Miss Mathews, when cattle
can't get to water, they die.

98
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:12,906
There's miles of river on
each side of our homestead.

99
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:17,034
This country's unfenced rangeland.
It always was, and always will be.

100
00:10:17,111 --> 00:10:20,171
Get in there. All right,
give me room there, you guys.

101
00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:21,771
Come on, get in there.

102
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:24,375
Whoa, Pete. Come on in here.

103
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:27,384
Come on, get over there.
Give us a little room.

104
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:29,979
All right, Judge, there he is.

105
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:33,291
Mr. Harden, it's my
duty to inform you

106
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,592
that the larceny of an equine is a
capital offense, punishable by death,

107
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,060
but you can rest assured
that, in this court,

108
00:10:40,134 --> 00:10:43,661
a horse thief always gets a
fair trial before he's hung.

109
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:48,470
- Chickenfoot, that's your horse?
- Oh, why, Judge...

110
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:50,100
Can you prove it's your horse?

111
00:10:50,177 --> 00:10:54,978
Why, Judge, anybody here... I can prove
it by Pete himself that he's my horse.

112
00:10:55,783 --> 00:10:58,251
Pete, you're my horse, ain't you?

113
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:02,580
Ownership of horse clearly
established. It belongs to Chickenfoot.

114
00:11:02,655 --> 00:11:04,350
That's my ruling.

115
00:11:04,992 --> 00:11:07,187
Well, I don't contest it, Your
Honor. Maybe the horse does belong

116
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:10,162
to Chickenfoot here,
but I didn't steal it.

117
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,959
- How'd you get it then?
- I bought it.

118
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:14,861
Order in the court!

119
00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:18,132
- That all you got to say?
- That's all.

120
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:20,968
No, it's not. I'm not going to stay here
and see anybody railroaded like this.

121
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,975
Miss Mathews, I don't recollect you
was summoned as a witness in this trial.

122
00:11:24,043 --> 00:11:25,533
What kind of a trial
is it when a prisoner

123
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:27,306
isn't even allowed to
have anybody speak for him?

124
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,404
You an attorney, Miss?

125
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:30,506
I'm as much an attorney
as you are a judge.

126
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,913
- You know this man?
- No, I don't.

127
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,212
- You ever see him before?
- No, but...

128
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:34,878
- Can you prove he didn't
steal the horse? - No.

129
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:37,650
Then he don't need no lawyer then.
This man was caught on a stolen horse,

130
00:11:37,724 --> 00:11:39,487
and in this jurisdiction,
that's prima facie evidence.

131
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:43,995
- The case is closed and that's my ruling.
- Yes, and it's just like all your rulings!

132
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:48,994
The courtroom will now
be cleared of everybody,

133
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:53,094
excepting the judge, the jury,
the prisoner, the witnesses and...

134
00:11:54,206 --> 00:11:55,230
I guess that means you.

135
00:11:55,307 --> 00:11:58,504
All right, I'll go. I
don't want to see anymore.

136
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,611
It's murder, that's
what it is. Murder.

137
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,773
This man hasn't got a
chance, and you know it,

138
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,612
but you never give anybody a chance.

139
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,915
You didn't give us one when you
stampeded the cattle over our crops.

140
00:12:08,987 --> 00:12:11,683
You thought you'd starve the
homesteaders out, but you didn't.

141
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:14,954
You can pester us and rob us and
kill us, but you can't stop us.

142
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,585
'Cause there'll always be
more coming. More and more.

143
00:12:17,661 --> 00:12:22,621
And we'll stay on our farms in spite of
you, and your courtroom and your killers!

144
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:26,536
By gobs, she's all right.
She'd make a good cattleman.

145
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:29,129
If it wasn't for Lily, I'd marry her.

146
00:12:49,326 --> 00:12:50,325
Giddap.

147
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:53,252
You heard the case against
the accused, pro and con.

148
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:57,093
Now I guess maybe you'd better
retire to consider a verdict.

149
00:13:00,436 --> 00:13:02,803
Chickenfoot, you'd better take
Pete out for a little fresh air.

150
00:13:02,873 --> 00:13:05,397
Take him out, Bart. I got work to do.

151
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:16,448
And while you retire, there'll be
a recess for them that's thirsty.

152
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:24,490
Well, I guess you
can't take it with you.

153
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:27,760
It's got to be strictly understood

154
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,323
you ain't making no effort to influence
the sober judgment of the jury.

155
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:33,926
- Certainly not.
- There you are.

156
00:13:34,436 --> 00:13:37,837
- Compliments of the prisoner.
- Jury to the rear!

157
00:13:44,112 --> 00:13:45,444
Bull's-eye.

158
00:13:52,187 --> 00:13:55,054
- Join me, Your Honor?
- Don't mind if I do.

159
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:01,252
Don't spill none of that liquor,
son. It eats right into the bar.

160
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:21,878
To the unfortunate lady
with the bullet in her face.

161
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:26,218
The man that fired that bullet
was hauled out of here feet first.

162
00:14:26,787 --> 00:14:27,846
And he ought to be.

163
00:14:27,923 --> 00:14:31,017
Any man that'd shoot at a picture
of Lily Langtry ought to be killed.

164
00:14:31,093 --> 00:14:32,286
It's just retribution.

165
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,693
It's justifiable homicide,
that was my ruling.

166
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:36,923
Right.

167
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:43,963
You an admirer of Miss Lily's, too?

168
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:47,200
Well, that's putting it mildly.

169
00:14:49,644 --> 00:14:52,477
She's the most beautiful
woman I ever met.

170
00:14:54,015 --> 00:14:55,073
Met?

171
00:14:57,184 --> 00:15:00,812
You mean to tell me you met Lily
Langtry, the real her, in the flesh?

172
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:02,411
Oh, many times.

173
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:05,518
What an actress.

174
00:15:08,261 --> 00:15:10,287
How'd you get to know her?

175
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:14,656
Well, that's a long story, Judge.

176
00:15:16,837 --> 00:15:19,862
Bart, you and Blackjack
get yourself a drink, huh?

177
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:24,702
Mighty fine liquor.
What do you call it?

178
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:28,111
- Rub of the brush. Go on.
- Rub of the brush?

179
00:15:28,214 --> 00:15:31,740
- Did you get to know her real well?
- It's got character.

180
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:38,586
I said, did you get
to know her real well?

181
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:45,760
Now, Judge, you forget a gentleman
never discusses a lady in a barroom.

182
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:48,823
Who said it's a barroom?
This is a courtroom.

183
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:54,000
Say, tell me, is she as
pretty as them pictures?

184
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:59,734
Why, the picture's never been made
that can do justice to Lily Langtry.

185
00:15:59,812 --> 00:16:01,541
Is she good-natured?

186
00:16:04,283 --> 00:16:05,682
An angel.

187
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:13,685
- I'll never forget the night we met.
- Yeah?

188
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:19,524
I'll never forget
it as long as I live.

189
00:16:40,485 --> 00:16:41,485
Who was that?

190
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:44,612
Oh, that's Mort Borrow.
He cleans up around here.

191
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:46,650
Go on about Lily.

192
00:16:50,762 --> 00:16:52,229
Oh, yeah, Lily.

193
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:00,901
How about a verdict?

194
00:17:00,972 --> 00:17:04,032
Can't you see we're still
considering the evidence?

195
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:08,144
Two aces. COWBOY Bet
a dollar and a half.

196
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:09,611
Stay once.

197
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,381
Get away from here. You
smell of formaldehyde!

198
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,008
I'll call that.

199
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,344
You been down around
Lanno Bay, ain't you?

200
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:18,752
Sure.

201
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:21,757
Well, you know how it is at sunset.

202
00:17:22,826 --> 00:17:27,660
You can look out and that water ain't
exactly blue, and it ain't exactly purple.

203
00:17:28,398 --> 00:17:32,357
It's a kind of color a man can
feel, but he can't put a name to.

204
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:33,528
Yeah.

205
00:17:35,672 --> 00:17:37,696
Well, that's Lily's eyes.

206
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,371
By gobs!

207
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,877
I'm out. COWBOY I'll
stay out. Here we go.

208
00:17:51,888 --> 00:17:54,412
Got 10. Got a nine.

209
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,291
You know how bright and
coppery and gold-like

210
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:02,296
a young chestnut horse is
running in the bright sun?

211
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:06,323
- Yeah. - Well, her hair is
something like that.

212
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:10,595
In the daytime.

213
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,307
You mean it's different at night?

214
00:18:13,374 --> 00:18:16,775
Well, not different,
but just sort of more so.

215
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:20,112
- How so?
- Well...

216
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:26,243
Well, you know how it is at dusk when you
see a prairie fire reflected in the sky.

217
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:32,854
A sort of a deep... A
beautiful kind of blushing...

218
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:34,989
- Red?
- Red.

219
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:41,161
- Well, that'll give you a rough idea.
- By gobs.

220
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:48,468
I got a lock of her hair.

221
00:18:52,113 --> 00:18:55,980
You mean to tell me you actually
got the real... From her head?

222
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:04,550
I don't suppose you'd ever
part with that lock of hair,

223
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,355
no matter what a man
was willing to give?

224
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:11,520
A man don't trade things like that.

225
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:17,629
You see that sword up there?

226
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:21,834
I wore it in the civil war.
Always meant to be buried with it.

227
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:24,207
Now, if you was
willing to swap, why...

228
00:19:26,146 --> 00:19:27,977
Would you really like to have it?

229
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:32,178
I'd rather own it than the state
of Texas. Let's have a look at it.

230
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:36,878
I haven't got it with me.

231
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,649
Where's it at?

232
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:45,192
It's with my stuff in El Paso.

233
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:48,563
So, you was in the
civil war, huh, Judge?

234
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:50,659
- El Paso, huh?
- Yeah.

235
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:55,368
- Cavalry, huh?
- I suppose you could write for it.

236
00:19:58,077 --> 00:19:59,408
Yeah.

237
00:19:59,478 --> 00:20:02,413
Wouldn't take long to
get here by mail coach.

238
00:20:02,782 --> 00:20:04,613
Oh, two, three weeks.

239
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:09,117
- Two or three weeks, huh?
- Yeah, about.

240
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:31,939
But I wouldn't part with that lock
of hair for anything in the world.

241
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:42,953
The jury's ready, Judge.

242
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:45,049
That bottle of whiskey gone already?

243
00:20:45,122 --> 00:20:49,253
Yeah, and if he ain't paid for it,
you better start collecting now.

244
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:05,234
- What's the verdict?
- You know what the verdict is. Guilty.

245
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:13,547
There's only one thing I can do.

246
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:16,347
You're sentenced to
hang, that's my ruling.

247
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,819
Turn loose the prisoner's hands.

248
00:21:17,888 --> 00:21:21,415
- But, Judge, you just ruled...
- I didn't finish my ruling.

249
00:21:23,894 --> 00:21:26,658
The court sentenced
the prisoner to hang,

250
00:21:27,231 --> 00:21:30,359
but the court didn't say when. So
long as there's reasonable doubt...

251
00:21:30,434 --> 00:21:32,129
What reasonable doubt, Judge?

252
00:21:32,202 --> 00:21:33,897
We just caught him with
Chickenfoot's horse.

253
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,269
- Ain't any room for doubt.
- Order!

254
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:42,568
I been talking to the prisoner.
He's a friend of Lily Langtry's.

255
00:21:43,614 --> 00:21:47,811
Stands to reason no friend of Lily
Langtry goes around stealing horses.

256
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:49,681
Leastways, there's
a reasonable doubt.

257
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:51,846
You mean, you're setting
aside your own ruling?

258
00:21:51,921 --> 00:21:54,982
That ain't what I said. When
I make a ruling, it stands.

259
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:56,686
But, Judge, you just
sentenced the man.

260
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,590
His sentence is suspended

261
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:01,289
for a couple weeks until I can
look into the matter further.

262
00:22:01,364 --> 00:22:02,991
That's my ruling.

263
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,808
- Hi, Mort. How's business?
- Just lost a customer.

264
00:22:21,117 --> 00:22:22,744
Well, I'll be down for
a shave in a minute.

265
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:24,718
All right, you're next.

266
00:22:35,163 --> 00:22:37,427
- Howdy, Judge.
- Hello, Evans.

267
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:39,262
Jersey Lily special.

268
00:22:53,281 --> 00:22:56,910
Pardon me, you don't happen
to have a twin brother, do you?

269
00:22:56,985 --> 00:22:58,577
No, not me.

270
00:22:59,654 --> 00:23:02,747
Well, you'd better pay
me that money you owe me.

271
00:23:02,957 --> 00:23:05,755
<i>You're loco, brother.
I don't owe you nothing.</i>

272
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:07,350
You owe me $60.

273
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:13,759
$60.

274
00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:11,549
If you're interested, that's the
man that sold me the roan horse.

275
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:13,921
Then, he's the man that stole...

276
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:57,867
$84 and 6 bits.

277
00:25:06,544 --> 00:25:08,444
Fined $80 for disorderly conduct,

278
00:25:08,513 --> 00:25:11,676
and $4 and 6 bits for
carrying concealed weapons.

279
00:25:12,618 --> 00:25:14,812
Now, you men get some
rope and string him up.

280
00:25:14,886 --> 00:25:17,515
String him up? Why,
he's dead already.

281
00:25:17,922 --> 00:25:20,982
We hang horse thieves,
don't we? String him up!

282
00:25:22,026 --> 00:25:23,755
Come inside, son.

283
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:32,001
You can have his horse and outfit.

284
00:25:39,777 --> 00:25:42,301
- Rub of the brush?
- Rub of the brush.

285
00:25:48,252 --> 00:25:50,549
- El Paso.
- El Paso.

286
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,293
Good morning, Judge.

287
00:30:02,232 --> 00:30:03,665
Who are you?

288
00:30:07,704 --> 00:30:10,696
Who are you? What are you doing here?

289
00:30:17,514 --> 00:30:19,777
Stranger. Stranger, come here.

290
00:30:21,517 --> 00:30:24,486
Straighten out my neck, would
you? Grab a hold of my head.

291
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:26,715
Now, jerk it quick.

292
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:31,356
Thank you. It's my neck.

293
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:37,095
You see I was hung once, but
my friends cut me down in time.

294
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,400
Now when I don't live right,
why, the crick comes back on me.

295
00:31:01,189 --> 00:31:04,488
Now, who are you, anyhow?
And what are you doing here?

296
00:31:05,861 --> 00:31:07,954
Why, don't you remember?

297
00:31:08,496 --> 00:31:10,760
Why, I'm the fellow that
filled the inside straight,

298
00:31:10,832 --> 00:31:12,629
and won Chickenfoot's horse.

299
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:17,529
So long, Judge.

300
00:31:27,415 --> 00:31:30,782
Hey, Pete, are you glad I
won you from Chickenfoot?

301
00:31:31,152 --> 00:31:33,142
Well, that makes it nice.

302
00:31:33,755 --> 00:31:34,754
Here.

303
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:29,364
Wait!

304
00:33:30,434 --> 00:33:31,834
Wait!

305
00:34:21,084 --> 00:34:23,382
That lock of hair, Lily's hair,

306
00:34:25,756 --> 00:34:30,693
you promised to write to El Paso for
it. Don't you remember? We drank on it.

307
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,821
When are you going to do it?

308
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,370
Huh?

309
00:34:43,673 --> 00:34:47,803
- You ain't going to crawfish?
- No, the first post office I come to.

310
00:34:48,877 --> 00:34:51,278
Straighten her out, would you, son?

311
00:34:54,116 --> 00:34:55,481
Thank you.

312
00:35:05,227 --> 00:35:08,788
You mangy old scorpion, you
might have got us both killed.

313
00:35:21,342 --> 00:35:25,074
- What you want to go to California
for? - See the Pacific Ocean.

314
00:35:25,147 --> 00:35:27,944
It's just like the
gulf down at Lanno Bay.

315
00:35:28,282 --> 00:35:29,647
It's bigger.

316
00:35:30,886 --> 00:35:33,719
Why don't you stay
around Vinegarroon awhile?

317
00:35:33,822 --> 00:35:37,622
We could have a lot of fun together.
We could talk about Lily and...

318
00:35:37,692 --> 00:35:40,457
No, I'm on my way.

319
00:35:42,197 --> 00:35:43,390
Listen,

320
00:35:45,266 --> 00:35:48,326
it's a great country
here, west of the Pecos.

321
00:35:48,402 --> 00:35:51,030
A fellow could really
make something of himself.

322
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:53,904
Why, when I first come
here, I didn't have nothing.

323
00:35:53,975 --> 00:35:56,466
Now, I'm boss of the whole section.

324
00:35:57,178 --> 00:35:59,806
Well, that's mighty fine, Judge.

325
00:36:00,882 --> 00:36:03,850
You know, I cottoned to you
the first time I seen you.

326
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:05,943
Why don't you put in with me?

327
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,251
Well, I tell you, Judge,
it's nice of you to ask me,

328
00:36:09,323 --> 00:36:15,352
but I'm heading for California, and
nothing short of hanging can stop me.

329
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:21,129
Wait a minute. You can't go.
You're under suspended sentence.

330
00:36:21,202 --> 00:36:23,362
- Why, you hung Mr. Evans for that.
- Huh?

331
00:36:23,436 --> 00:36:25,427
You're under suspendence, anyhow.

332
00:36:25,505 --> 00:36:28,633
Who are you? What do I know about you?
How do I know they ain't looking for you?

333
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:33,475
You're under arrest for disorderly conduct,
for disturbing the peace, vagrancy,

334
00:36:33,547 --> 00:36:36,812
and you're on the way back to
town with me, and that's my ruling!

335
00:36:36,883 --> 00:36:38,407
So long, Judge.

336
00:37:00,206 --> 00:37:02,198
By gobs, he stole my gun.

337
00:37:11,984 --> 00:37:14,612
We hired out for farm
work, Miss, not a civil war.

338
00:37:14,687 --> 00:37:16,655
This ain't no fit
place to homestead in.

339
00:37:16,722 --> 00:37:18,747
Land's no good when there's
always lead flying over it.

340
00:37:18,823 --> 00:37:20,586
If you'd shoot back, maybe
they'd stop bothering you.

341
00:37:20,658 --> 00:37:21,751
We did shoot back.

342
00:37:21,827 --> 00:37:25,024
And so did Shad Wilkins, and
he ain't trying it no more.

343
00:37:25,097 --> 00:37:26,996
What about your own quarter section?

344
00:37:27,065 --> 00:37:29,626
- If you leave, you'll lose it.
- We don't want no part of it.

345
00:37:29,702 --> 00:37:31,397
All right, Hod. If you feel that way,

346
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,994
we'll try to get along
with just Eph and Henry.

347
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:35,266
Not me.

348
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:41,473
Henry, if we only had one
man, it'd be a big help.

349
00:37:41,547 --> 00:37:43,275
Sorry, Mr. Mathews.

350
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:54,154
Call themselves men.

351
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,293
Wade, what do we do?

352
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:13,902
- I know what to do.
- No, no, wait. That's not the way.

353
00:38:13,978 --> 00:38:15,843
Don't even think of it.

354
00:38:17,681 --> 00:38:20,583
Wade, aren't you going
to stay for supper?

355
00:38:21,018 --> 00:38:22,485
I'll be back.

356
00:38:37,034 --> 00:38:38,592
Well, they left.

357
00:38:38,669 --> 00:38:40,568
Of course they have.
What did you expect?

358
00:38:40,636 --> 00:38:42,468
My hands quit, too. You
can't blame them for leaving.

359
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:44,530
There won't be a hired man
left in this part of the country

360
00:38:44,608 --> 00:38:46,041
if we don't do something about it.

361
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:48,441
We hire new hands,
same thing will happen.

362
00:38:48,512 --> 00:38:50,411
What's old Mathews
going to say about it?

363
00:38:50,479 --> 00:38:53,448
He keeps passing the
buck to the Lord Jehovah.

364
00:38:53,516 --> 00:38:55,450
I say, let's do something
about it ourselves.

365
00:38:55,518 --> 00:38:57,349
- That's right.
- That's what I like to hear.

366
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,821
Let's give the judge the same
thing he gave Shad Wilkins.

367
00:39:00,356 --> 00:39:04,349
Maybe if some of us went down and
appealed to Roy Bean for justice...

368
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:08,591
Justice. If you'd seen him yesterday,
pretending to try that prisoner...

369
00:39:08,664 --> 00:39:10,325
The man didn't have a chance.

370
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:13,425
- I wonder if they hanged him.
- Don't they always?

371
00:39:13,502 --> 00:39:16,437
He was the same as dead
even while he stood there.

372
00:39:16,505 --> 00:39:19,099
I've kept on seeing his face all day.

373
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,647
What is it, Daughter?

374
00:39:28,718 --> 00:39:32,279
The man I told you about,
the one that was hanged.

375
00:39:32,355 --> 00:39:35,415
I saw him plain as day,
looking in the window.

376
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:42,424
You're seeing things, Jane
Ellen. There's nobody out there.

377
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,657
I saw his face, I tell you.

378
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,628
Come in.

379
00:39:52,574 --> 00:39:54,064
Good evening.

380
00:40:02,751 --> 00:40:04,582
Pardon me for intruding like this.

381
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:10,146
Oh, no, you're not. It's just...
Well, I thought you were a ghost.

382
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:14,626
Well, I guess you're
partly to blame I'm not.

383
00:40:14,696 --> 00:40:18,654
- I just stopped in to thank you.
- Father, this is Mister...

384
00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:22,224
- Harden.
- Welcome, Mr. Harden, welcome.

385
00:40:22,636 --> 00:40:24,263
Glad to meet you.

386
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,503
Oh, Mr. Harden, this is
our neighbor Wade Harper.

387
00:40:29,777 --> 00:40:32,075
This is the man I told you about.

388
00:40:32,146 --> 00:40:35,013
You mean to tell me Bean
tried you, and let you go?

389
00:40:35,082 --> 00:40:37,982
Well, she was my lawyer. I guess
she's the one that got me off.

390
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:40,383
- I knew you weren't a horse thief.
- Thanks.

391
00:40:41,755 --> 00:40:43,620
How did you know that?

392
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,716
I just knew.

393
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:49,252
Are you working anywhere?

394
00:40:50,664 --> 00:40:54,122
No, I'm heading for California.

395
00:40:54,834 --> 00:41:00,398
Mr. Harden, I suppose a body that's just
been hanged is apt to be a bit hungry.

396
00:41:00,474 --> 00:41:02,464
You must stay for supper.

397
00:41:06,312 --> 00:41:09,440
- Well, I don't want to put you out any.
- Oh, no, not at all.

398
00:41:09,515 --> 00:41:12,541
Matter of fact, we had some
company that just disappointed us.

399
00:41:12,618 --> 00:41:16,019
Uh-huh. We were hoping somebody'd
show up to take their place.

400
00:41:16,088 --> 00:41:19,319
Make yourself at home,
now. Make yourself at home.

401
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:27,961
Wait till you sink your teeth
into some of Jane Ellen's stew.

402
00:41:36,142 --> 00:41:41,307
Oh, Lord, for that which thou
hast sent us in our hour of need,

403
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,272
make us truly grateful.

404
00:41:44,717 --> 00:41:49,552
Bless this food to our use and
ourselves to thy service. Amen.

405
00:41:50,455 --> 00:41:52,047
Let me help you.

406
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:55,583
How about some hominy?

407
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,321
- Here, Wade. Give him some milk.
- All right, all right.

408
00:41:57,395 --> 00:41:59,158
Give him some milk.

409
00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:04,132
I think he likes it
here. I think we got him.

410
00:42:04,202 --> 00:42:06,636
- What's he doing now?
- Feeding his horse.

411
00:42:06,705 --> 00:42:11,471
Wade, he could probably take the place
of two men. He's so big and strong.

412
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:14,943
- Well, I don't know how strong he is.
- Strong enough, Wade.

413
00:42:15,012 --> 00:42:17,640
Now, Jane Ellen, we'll
leave you alone with him,

414
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:19,945
and you kind of add on
a little more welcome.

415
00:42:20,017 --> 00:42:22,611
- What'll I say?
- Oh, just keep smiling at him.

416
00:42:22,686 --> 00:42:27,419
And, Daughter, if it should
come up natural - like,

417
00:42:27,491 --> 00:42:30,790
you might hint what
a handsome man he is.

418
00:42:31,428 --> 00:42:32,656
Handsome?

419
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:36,928
We need him terribly bad, Daughter.
We got to get that corn husked.

420
00:42:37,066 --> 00:42:38,967
We need him terribly bad.

421
00:42:39,036 --> 00:42:41,402
- Listen, your father don't mean
for you to... - Shh.

422
00:42:41,472 --> 00:42:42,769
Look out.

423
00:42:44,808 --> 00:42:46,673
Everything all right, Mr. Harden?

424
00:42:46,744 --> 00:42:49,542
- Fine, thanks. - Good. Now,
I'll go see about your bunk.

425
00:42:49,613 --> 00:42:52,410
- Oh, don't trouble.
- No trouble at all. Come on, Wade.

426
00:43:05,995 --> 00:43:07,861
- Can I give you a hand?
- Oh, no, thanks.

427
00:43:08,565 --> 00:43:12,262
- Won't you sit down, please?
- Well, I won't argue with you.

428
00:43:12,903 --> 00:43:15,871
If I had to wash dishes,
I guess I'd give up eating.

429
00:43:15,939 --> 00:43:18,567
Well, what do you do about
the dishes when you're home?

430
00:43:18,641 --> 00:43:20,802
Home? What? You mean in a house?

431
00:43:21,176 --> 00:43:23,076
Well, you live in a house, don't you?

432
00:43:23,246 --> 00:43:28,616
No. No, my house is all out there,
all one room with a sky for a roof.

433
00:43:29,785 --> 00:43:33,620
- Well, it's a big place.
- Got some space to rent.

434
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:38,685
Well, I guess California's
your next stop, huh?

435
00:43:38,795 --> 00:43:44,164
California, but I don't
stop. Oregon next, I guess.

436
00:43:44,399 --> 00:43:47,459
Well, all places
aren't just the same.

437
00:43:47,603 --> 00:43:51,130
Wouldn't you rather stay a
little longer in some places?

438
00:43:51,206 --> 00:43:53,936
No, they're all the same,
beautiful when you leave them.

439
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:57,676
Well, it's like the turtles.
Carry their houses with them.

440
00:43:57,746 --> 00:44:00,146
If I had to build me a
house, I'd have it on wheels.

441
00:44:00,582 --> 00:44:05,110
Not me. I'd want my house so
that nothing could ever move it.

442
00:44:05,654 --> 00:44:08,451
So down deep that an
earthquake couldn't shake it,

443
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:12,216
and a cyclone would be
just another wind going by.

444
00:44:14,496 --> 00:44:18,556
Well, you say, "Who
wants to be a turtle?"

445
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:23,098
And I say, "I hope you'll be
very happy in your house. "

446
00:44:32,446 --> 00:44:36,712
- Well...
- Oh, say, wait a minute.

447
00:44:36,784 --> 00:44:38,115
What?

448
00:44:38,185 --> 00:44:40,551
I'll bet I know something
we could agree on.

449
00:44:40,621 --> 00:44:41,713
What's that?

450
00:44:41,789 --> 00:44:44,723
Well, in about a week now,
we're going to husk the corn,

451
00:44:45,459 --> 00:44:47,518
and I'll bet you'll
agree that that's fun.

452
00:44:48,663 --> 00:44:51,860
Well, you know, I think husking
corn's the greatest fun in the world.

453
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:55,192
- Husking corn, fun?
- Oh, yes!

454
00:44:56,636 --> 00:45:00,300
- Well, I'd rather wash dishes.
- Oh, no.

455
00:45:02,342 --> 00:45:06,608
It was a fine supper,
and good cooking.

456
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:11,507
Oh, Mr. Harden.

457
00:45:18,657 --> 00:45:20,922
What a handsome man you are.

458
00:45:26,633 --> 00:45:28,600
I doubt that, but I'm a tired one.

459
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:32,034
Well, I hope I see you in
the morning before I leave.

460
00:45:39,412 --> 00:45:41,572
Get out of here! Hey!

461
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,783
If anybody'd told me yesterday
I'd be playing tag in a cornfield

462
00:45:55,861 --> 00:45:57,851
with a lot of cows...

463
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,494
If we had some men
that would ride fence,

464
00:46:00,566 --> 00:46:03,467
there wouldn't be any
cows in the cornfield.

465
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,266
You were sure cute last night.

466
00:46:09,674 --> 00:46:11,073
Now you're making fun of me.

467
00:46:11,142 --> 00:46:14,737
Well, that's... That's
more fun than picking corn.

468
00:46:21,018 --> 00:46:23,851
Hey, look at your father.
I wonder what's up.

469
00:46:31,662 --> 00:46:34,222
I tried to stop them.
They wouldn't listen to me.

470
00:46:34,298 --> 00:46:35,297
Wade!

471
00:46:35,365 --> 00:46:37,926
Yes, yes. It's the wrong
and lawless thing to do.

472
00:46:38,002 --> 00:46:41,665
- I begged them not to. I told them.
- Who? What happened?

473
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:44,071
Wade Harper has rounded
up some of the men.

474
00:46:44,142 --> 00:46:46,303
They going to town
to lynch Judge Bean.

475
00:46:46,377 --> 00:46:48,208
- When did they leave?
- About an hour ago.

476
00:46:48,279 --> 00:46:49,610
They took our wagon.

477
00:47:47,069 --> 00:47:49,469
Thunder and lightning! You
back from California already?

478
00:47:49,538 --> 00:47:51,335
You got to get out of here,
and don't stop for nothing.

479
00:47:51,407 --> 00:47:52,407
Did you write to El Paso?

480
00:47:52,474 --> 00:47:54,772
Listen, just get on your horse
and get, because they're after you.

481
00:47:54,844 --> 00:47:57,438
Did you write? Who's after me?

482
00:47:57,613 --> 00:47:59,740
The homesteaders. They're
going to string you up.

483
00:48:00,315 --> 00:48:02,078
Why, that bunch of plow-pushing sod!

484
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:04,619
They're outside right now,
a whole wagonload of them.

485
00:48:04,687 --> 00:48:07,884
A wagonload? Why, I can
handle a train load of them.

486
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:10,348
I'll tear their livers out.

487
00:48:34,515 --> 00:48:35,846
What'll it be, gentlemen?

488
00:48:36,317 --> 00:48:38,945
It'll be Roy Bean. Where is he?

489
00:48:40,588 --> 00:48:42,317
He's out for a while.

490
00:48:43,725 --> 00:48:46,888
That's because you came
down here and warned him.

491
00:49:00,774 --> 00:49:02,935
Make a move and I'll kill you.

492
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,606
Cole, start collecting them shotguns,

493
00:49:11,018 --> 00:49:14,419
uncork them rifles now and set
them down this end of the bar,

494
00:49:14,488 --> 00:49:15,488
easy-like.

495
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:18,751
Go on.

496
00:49:25,331 --> 00:49:28,459
Get back. Get back.

497
00:49:45,918 --> 00:49:48,011
Now, I'll take yours, Judge.

498
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:33,028
The drinks are on me, gentlemen.

499
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:40,364
We're not drinking with
you, Harden, nor him, either.

500
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:44,002
I ain't serving none of my liquor
to no bunch of tomato-kissing,

501
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:46,373
- plow-pushing...
- Now, Judge,

502
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,077
we don't want any harsh words to spoil
this friendly little get-together.

503
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:51,342
Get-together?

504
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:55,812
Why, this pack of weasels invade
the dignity of my courtroom,

505
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:59,954
come in here armed with malice
aforethought to kick up a rumpus...

506
00:51:00,124 --> 00:51:04,584
Now, look, you being a judge, you know
there's always two sides to any question.

507
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:07,355
These men have come here
with a legitimate grievance.

508
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,626
We're not asking you
to speak for us, Harden.

509
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:10,927
No, nor me, either.

510
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:15,465
Well, that makes it unanimous. I'm
going to talk for the both of you.

511
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:19,504
There's a law here
against fencing land

512
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,544
that seems nothing short of
murder to people raising crops,

513
00:51:22,912 --> 00:51:24,847
but it's common sense
to men running cattle.

514
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:28,875
I've seen this kind of war before.

515
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:31,283
It's happening now, back
in Kansas and Nebraska.

516
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:33,882
The cattlemen came in first,

517
00:51:33,956 --> 00:51:36,687
then the homesteaders moved
in and fenced them out.

518
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,991
They had crops for one year,
and then a dry spell, drought,

519
00:51:41,597 --> 00:51:42,825
so the homesteaders moved out,

520
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:45,333
and the rush and thistle
and jimson moved in.

521
00:51:45,401 --> 00:51:48,268
And the big spaces were all broken
up by little quarter sections,

522
00:51:49,338 --> 00:51:50,532
and the homesteads left empty,

523
00:51:50,606 --> 00:51:53,871
and the houses caved in, and the
land, no good for man or cattle.

524
00:51:53,943 --> 00:51:56,740
You spoiled the land, then you
came here to spoil this land.

525
00:51:56,812 --> 00:51:58,212
This here's a big country.

526
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,512
Yea, but it ain't big enough for cattlemen
and homesteaders, and it never will be.

527
00:52:01,584 --> 00:52:04,882
Now, clear out here.
That's my ruling.

528
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:10,247
All right, Bean, we're going.

529
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:13,653
We're going back to build our fences.

530
00:52:13,895 --> 00:52:17,627
If you do, you better build
coffins along with them. Now, get.

531
00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:10,374
You sure told them off, son.

532
00:53:11,485 --> 00:53:13,316
Yep, and now I'm
going to tell you off.

533
00:53:13,387 --> 00:53:15,651
I'm sorry I stopped
them from lynching you.

534
00:53:15,723 --> 00:53:17,748
They got a right to
defend their homesteads.

535
00:53:17,925 --> 00:53:20,519
You know this ain't homestead
land. You just said so yourself.

536
00:53:20,594 --> 00:53:23,927
- The government didn't say so.
- I'm the government here.

537
00:53:23,998 --> 00:53:27,125
Judas Priest, I don't see how you
can talk up for scum like that.

538
00:53:27,201 --> 00:53:29,328
They proved up on their land,
and they got deeds to it.

539
00:53:29,403 --> 00:53:31,098
When you make war on
them, you're making war

540
00:53:31,172 --> 00:53:33,366
on their women and kids, too.

541
00:53:33,907 --> 00:53:35,465
Those people were
starved out last year.

542
00:53:35,542 --> 00:53:38,534
I heard about those cattle
being stampeded over their crops,

543
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:41,546
and there's too many strays running
loose in that valley right now,

544
00:53:41,781 --> 00:53:43,578
only they're not strays.

545
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:46,880
What do you want me to
do? Arrest them cattle,

546
00:53:46,953 --> 00:53:49,387
and fine them a couple
dollars apiece for trespass?

547
00:53:50,857 --> 00:53:51,857
Now, look,

548
00:53:52,759 --> 00:53:57,162
those people don't take up much room with
their little shirt-sized pieces of land.

549
00:53:58,164 --> 00:54:00,996
Why don't you be a real
judge for all of the people?

550
00:54:02,335 --> 00:54:05,770
Why don't you try to see their side of
it, and help them instead of fight them?

551
00:54:06,806 --> 00:54:09,433
Make peace around
here instead of war.

552
00:54:10,243 --> 00:54:14,440
There's plenty of room for everybody,
then everybody'd look up to you.

553
00:54:16,883 --> 00:54:20,216
And then someday, maybe they'd put
up a statue out there in the street,

554
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:27,080
a statue with a carving on it.
"To Roy Bean, the real judge. "

555
00:54:29,695 --> 00:54:31,856
What are you doing? Catching a fish?

556
00:54:33,431 --> 00:54:34,729
I guess I'm wasting my time.

557
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,030
Hold on, wait a minute. You
write that letter to El Paso yet?

558
00:54:37,102 --> 00:54:40,002
- No!
- You promised. We drank on it.

559
00:54:41,106 --> 00:54:43,232
I didn't have to write it.
I had it on me all the time.

560
00:54:43,307 --> 00:54:45,640
You did? Well, why didn't
you give it to me then?

561
00:54:46,844 --> 00:54:50,143
You old bullhead, if I'd have
given it to you, you'd have hung me.

562
00:54:50,214 --> 00:54:51,704
Wouldn't you?

563
00:54:51,983 --> 00:54:55,384
- I might've at that. Let's have a look
at it. - I haven't got it with me.

564
00:54:55,453 --> 00:54:57,445
Suffering, bleeding
Chickamauga! Where's it at?

565
00:54:57,756 --> 00:54:59,950
I left it over at the Mathews' place.

566
00:55:00,157 --> 00:55:01,522
- How is she?
- Huh?

567
00:55:01,659 --> 00:55:03,889
- I'll ride right over with you.
- No, no.

568
00:55:04,729 --> 00:55:07,425
You mean you're gonna crawfish?
You ain't going to give it to me?

569
00:55:07,531 --> 00:55:09,761
- Sure, I'll give it to you.
- When?

570
00:55:10,301 --> 00:55:12,997
When the last steer's
out of the valley.

571
00:55:13,237 --> 00:55:15,296
All right, I'll pass the
word around to the boys.

572
00:55:15,373 --> 00:55:18,035
No, you don't. You're going
to help run those cattle out,

573
00:55:18,109 --> 00:55:21,340
and I'm going along with
you to see that it's done.

574
00:55:21,612 --> 00:55:23,603
Don't you trust me, Cole?

575
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:26,712
When I was a kid, I
had a pet rattlesnake.

576
00:55:26,784 --> 00:55:30,117
I was fond of it, but I
wouldn't turn my back on it.

577
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:34,554
You're all right.

578
00:55:35,326 --> 00:55:38,489
I'm going back now, and gathering
my stuff for the roundup.

579
00:55:40,897 --> 00:55:44,094
- And that lock of hair.
- Yeah, yeah, the lock of hair.

580
00:55:57,514 --> 00:55:59,175
He defended Bean.
He said he was right.

581
00:55:59,549 --> 00:56:02,450
Said the homesteaders spoiled this
land for the cattlemen. We all heard it.

582
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:04,214
I don't care what you heard.

583
00:56:04,287 --> 00:56:06,050
He couldn't be two-faced.
He's not that kind.

584
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,049
If he took Bean's part, he
only did it to stop trouble.

585
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:11,626
Miss Mathews,

586
00:56:13,128 --> 00:56:15,996
looks like every time I get into
trouble, you always speak up for me.

587
00:56:16,066 --> 00:56:18,533
They're trying to tell
me you spoke up for Bean.

588
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,866
Well, I did try to tell
them Bean's point of view.

589
00:56:22,938 --> 00:56:23,938
There you are.

590
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,401
It's always been my experience

591
00:56:27,476 --> 00:56:30,876
that when you know the other fellow's
point of view, you usually get together.

592
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:34,048
Well, why didn't you tell
him our point of view?

593
00:56:34,116 --> 00:56:35,515
I did, and we got together.

594
00:56:36,885 --> 00:56:39,820
You won't have to patrol
your fields any longer.

595
00:56:39,888 --> 00:56:41,947
Judge gave me his word they'd
round up all cattle in this valley

596
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:43,116
and take them out of here.

597
00:56:44,292 --> 00:56:46,488
You think he'd keep his word?

598
00:56:46,895 --> 00:56:49,590
Well, I'm going along with
him to see that he does.

599
00:56:49,664 --> 00:56:52,531
Well, what makes you
think we'd take your word?

600
00:56:54,937 --> 00:56:56,130
Take it or leave it.

601
00:56:58,172 --> 00:56:59,503
Harden,

602
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:03,101
you're a sneak and a liar.

603
00:58:32,698 --> 00:58:34,097
Miss Mathews!

604
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,040
I'll be back.

605
00:58:54,586 --> 00:58:56,417
California's that way.

606
00:58:58,957 --> 00:59:01,221
I got something to
tell you before I go.

607
00:59:03,828 --> 00:59:06,126
- Well?
- How's Wade?

608
00:59:07,499 --> 00:59:09,967
He's fine, just fine.

609
00:59:13,938 --> 00:59:16,839
You know, you're not the
prettiest girl I ever saw.

610
00:59:19,276 --> 00:59:21,438
Well, that's great
news. Who asked you?

611
00:59:22,113 --> 00:59:24,604
But you've got the
prettiest hair I ever saw.

612
00:59:27,384 --> 00:59:29,477
Why do you like to make fun of me?

613
00:59:31,856 --> 00:59:33,289
'Cause I like you, I guess.

614
00:59:34,759 --> 00:59:39,992
- And you think my hair's pretty, huh?
- I never saw anything like it.

615
00:59:49,972 --> 00:59:53,465
- Oh, could I clip a lock?
- No, you can't.

616
00:59:54,778 --> 00:59:57,110
- Will you clip one?
- No, I won't.

617
00:59:58,048 --> 01:00:01,040
Come around here,
take sides with Bean,

618
01:00:02,152 --> 01:00:04,450
and knock out my best friend, and...

619
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,287
Tell you how much I like you,

620
01:00:08,424 --> 01:00:12,053
and how much I might miss you?

621
01:00:33,349 --> 01:00:35,044
- All right?
- No.

622
01:00:46,061 --> 01:00:47,927
Here, these are yours.

623
01:01:31,805 --> 01:01:34,740
Well, thanks a lot.

624
01:02:21,854 --> 01:02:22,854
Jane Ellen!

625
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,836
Go on, Cole. Go on.

626
01:02:45,878 --> 01:02:50,815
Well, so I says to her...
I said, "Miss Langtry,

627
01:02:51,616 --> 01:02:54,517
"do you plan to go back to England
when you finish your American tour?"

628
01:02:56,021 --> 01:02:59,014
And she said to me... She said,

629
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:04,989
"No. " Said she loved the
United States too much.

630
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:06,654
- Yeah?
- She planned to stay here

631
01:03:06,732 --> 01:03:08,825
for the rest of her life.

632
01:03:10,569 --> 01:03:13,504
She told me that when she got all
through her work in the theater,

633
01:03:13,572 --> 01:03:16,268
that she wanted to settle down
someplace out here in the West.

634
01:03:17,274 --> 01:03:18,503
By gobs.

635
01:03:19,578 --> 01:03:22,512
Some quiet little place
way out on the range,

636
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:25,311
away from all the
lights and the crowds.

637
01:03:28,386 --> 01:03:30,819
She kept asking about
Texas especially.

638
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:38,724
She says that ever since she was a
little girl, she'd heard about Texas,

639
01:03:40,231 --> 01:03:44,292
and it'd always been the dream of
her life to have a home here someday.

640
01:03:45,402 --> 01:03:47,962
- She did?
- She did.

641
01:03:57,014 --> 01:03:59,505
Last herd just come in, Judge.

642
01:04:18,903 --> 01:04:20,233
Well?

643
01:04:20,704 --> 01:04:21,703
Huh?

644
01:04:26,976 --> 01:04:27,976
Oh.

645
01:05:54,295 --> 01:05:55,295
By gobs!

646
01:06:01,936 --> 01:06:03,494
A lock of her own hair!

647
01:06:07,007 --> 01:06:08,531
It's kind of dark, ain't it?

648
01:06:13,281 --> 01:06:15,976
Yeah, she uses lots
of shampoo on her hair.

649
01:06:16,082 --> 01:06:17,082
She does?

650
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:20,678
It's beautiful. Beautiful.

651
01:06:23,056 --> 01:06:25,923
I'll never forget this, Cole. Never.

652
01:06:30,096 --> 01:06:32,428
- Let me see it, will you?
- What for?

653
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,365
I ain't going to keep it.

654
01:06:36,236 --> 01:06:38,226
I'd like to see you try.

655
01:06:48,013 --> 01:06:51,779
- All right?
- All right.

656
01:07:00,426 --> 01:07:02,361
I know how you feel, son.

657
01:07:15,975 --> 01:07:17,602
Almighty God,

658
01:07:17,676 --> 01:07:21,874
we offer thee thanksgiving for
thy help and thy divine bounty.

659
01:07:22,715 --> 01:07:25,342
Thou has poured thy
blessings on our land.

660
01:07:26,151 --> 01:07:29,917
<i>Thou hast visited the
Earth and made it plenteous.</i>

661
01:07:30,055 --> 01:07:33,149
<i>Thou hast made it soft
with drops of rain,</i>

662
01:07:33,325 --> 01:07:36,851
<i>and the land that was desolate
has become like a garden,</i>

663
01:07:37,628 --> 01:07:41,655
<i>and the waste places are
become fenced and are inhabited.</i>

664
01:07:41,899 --> 01:07:45,232
<i>Thou hast made the tree of
the field yield her fruit,</i>

665
01:07:45,303 --> 01:07:46,930
<i>and the Earth, her increase.</i>

666
01:07:47,805 --> 01:07:50,239
Thou hast broken
the bonds of our yoke

667
01:07:50,308 --> 01:07:52,936
and delivered us out of
the hands of our enemies,

668
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:58,681
so that we shall dwell here safely,
and none shall make us afraid,

669
01:07:58,816 --> 01:08:04,754
and for this, thy divine bounty,
Oh, Lord, we thank thee. Amen.

670
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:06,585
Amen.
- Amen.

671
01:08:35,484 --> 01:08:37,213
<i>One foot up and the other foot down</i>

672
01:08:37,286 --> 01:08:39,847
<i>Swing them pretty
girls 'round and 'round</i>

673
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:50,121
Here it is.
- What?

674
01:08:52,068 --> 01:08:53,660
Tell me something first.

675
01:08:55,071 --> 01:08:56,596
Where do you keep my lock of hair?

676
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:58,971
Oh, uh...

677
01:09:00,509 --> 01:09:01,509
Show me.

678
01:09:07,183 --> 01:09:09,776
Nobody can see that, not even you.

679
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:19,326
Look, Cole, the best piece of
homestead land in the whole country.

680
01:09:21,897 --> 01:09:24,592
It used to belong to one of
the hired men that left us,

681
01:09:24,666 --> 01:09:27,192
and now it's anybody's.
You just claim it.

682
01:09:28,938 --> 01:09:31,770
Yeah, that's a fine
piece of land all right.

683
01:09:31,906 --> 01:09:33,966
Yeah, look at the feed on
those slopes over there,

684
01:09:34,576 --> 01:09:37,909
and that strip along the bottom
is just fine for wheat or corn.

685
01:09:40,748 --> 01:09:43,376
And, Cole, look, that
little knoll right there,

686
01:09:45,086 --> 01:09:47,316
it's just begging for a house.

687
01:09:51,259 --> 01:09:55,286
- Do you know how to build a house?
- No, how?

688
01:09:58,466 --> 01:10:00,991
Well, you... You...

689
01:10:05,305 --> 01:10:07,866
Well, you have the kitchen there,

690
01:10:09,711 --> 01:10:13,044
and the bedroom over there, and
the living room right in the middle.

691
01:10:14,682 --> 01:10:17,650
It would have to have the
right things in it, too.

692
01:10:19,086 --> 01:10:20,280
What sort of things?

693
01:10:21,622 --> 01:10:27,583
Oh, fires and lamplights, warm beds,

694
01:10:29,463 --> 01:10:33,057
the smell of coffee in the morning,
the sound of rain on the roof.

695
01:10:36,269 --> 01:10:39,466
Gee, that's a nice house, Jane Ellen.

696
01:10:56,522 --> 01:10:57,522
Jane!

697
01:11:14,707 --> 01:11:15,706
Look!

698
01:11:20,745 --> 01:11:23,680
Go to your homes!
Protect your houses!

699
01:11:23,748 --> 01:11:25,340
Hey, Wade, grab another team,

700
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:27,852
we'll take a section of rail fence
and knock down a strip of corn.

701
01:11:28,321 --> 01:11:30,254
Maybe we can start a backfire.

702
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:37,725
Take the two end sections, Wade!

703
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:53,226
Cole! Cole! Cole!

704
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:11,651
Hey, get out of here! Move!

705
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:40,146
Look, the house!

706
01:14:20,087 --> 01:14:25,389
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Father!

707
01:14:29,463 --> 01:14:31,761
Help! Help!

708
01:14:34,969 --> 01:14:36,435
Come on, hurry up!

709
01:15:08,801 --> 01:15:11,566
- Watch out for his leg
and shoulder. All right.

710
01:15:15,074 --> 01:15:16,098
Take it easy.

711
01:15:16,176 --> 01:15:18,269
- Have you seen Jane Mathews? No.

712
01:16:44,929 --> 01:16:48,455
So I hereby christen
this town Langtry!

713
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:56,930
No man ever gave a woman a whole
town afore, but I'm doing it,

714
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:01,677
and from now on, this whole section's
going to bloom like the Jersey Lily herself!

715
01:17:04,948 --> 01:17:07,916
Quiet! I ain't through yet.

716
01:17:08,985 --> 01:17:12,352
Miss Langtry's coming soon
to play a night in Fort Davis,

717
01:17:12,422 --> 01:17:15,186
and I want every legal
resident of Langtry, Texas,

718
01:17:15,258 --> 01:17:18,318
to go over and see the
godmother of this here town,

719
01:17:18,395 --> 01:17:23,127
a town of cattlemen, for cattlemen,
and by gobs, run by cattlemen!

720
01:17:30,373 --> 01:17:34,809
Now, in honor of this great occasion,
I'm dishing out free beer to one and all,

721
01:17:34,877 --> 01:17:37,539
and anybody found sober after sundown

722
01:17:37,613 --> 01:17:41,105
is liable to arrest for disorderly
conduct, and that's my ruling!

723
01:17:43,686 --> 01:17:45,278
Start the music!

724
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:08,062
"And man that is born of woman
has but a short time to live.

725
01:19:09,436 --> 01:19:12,405
"He cometh up and is
cut down like a flower.

726
01:19:13,673 --> 01:19:17,940
"He fleeth as if it were a shadow,
and never continueth in one stay.

727
01:19:21,348 --> 01:19:24,374
"In the midst of life,
we are in death. "

728
01:19:55,481 --> 01:19:59,610
The wagon train's left. The
people have all gone, Jane Ellen.

729
01:19:59,684 --> 01:20:04,348
I'm staying. Nobody's going
to drive me away from my land,

730
01:20:05,224 --> 01:20:08,920
not with cattle, or fire, or
killing my father, or anything else.

731
01:20:09,828 --> 01:20:13,286
I'll be here long after Bean and
his gang of murderers are gone.

732
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,964
Sure you will, and me, too.

733
01:20:19,637 --> 01:20:20,637
I don't want you.

734
01:20:21,806 --> 01:20:24,536
I don't want any of Roy
Bean's friends around.

735
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:29,512
Wade Harper was right. I didn't
believe it then, but I do now.

736
01:20:29,914 --> 01:20:32,040
You knew we were
going to be burned out.

737
01:20:32,283 --> 01:20:33,579
That's why you herded
all the cattle out,

738
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:36,017
so they wouldn't be
burned with our crops.

739
01:20:38,489 --> 01:20:43,052
No, I don't need your help. Not now.

740
01:20:44,763 --> 01:20:46,662
I can do what I have to do alone.

741
01:20:53,537 --> 01:20:55,004
I'll be back.

742
01:21:33,876 --> 01:21:35,468
Why, Cole!

743
01:21:36,412 --> 01:21:38,471
By gobs, man, I'm glad to see you.

744
01:21:38,548 --> 01:21:40,846
Why, I never wanted to see a
man so much before in my life.

745
01:21:40,917 --> 01:21:42,316
- What for?
- What for?

746
01:21:42,385 --> 01:21:45,081
Don't you know what for?
She's coming to Fort Davis.

747
01:21:45,353 --> 01:21:48,187
- Lily Langtry's coming to Fort Davis.
- Langtry?

748
01:21:48,324 --> 01:21:50,450
Langtry, yeah, and you and me
are going over there together.

749
01:21:50,526 --> 01:21:53,324
You're going to introduce me to
her. By gobs, I'm going to meet her.

750
01:21:53,395 --> 01:21:55,260
- I just can't believe it.
- I want to talk to you, Judge.

751
01:21:55,330 --> 01:21:57,356
Yeah, all right. And look what
I got to tell her when I see her.

752
01:21:57,433 --> 01:22:01,335
Langtry, that's the name of this
town, a great town after a great woman.

753
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:03,900
- I said I wanted to talk
to you, Judge. - Sure.

754
01:22:06,441 --> 01:22:07,534
Cole, it's a great day.

755
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:10,407
I tell you, it's the greatest
day in the history of Texas.

756
01:22:14,216 --> 01:22:16,878
- Some fire, huh?
- Yeah, wasn't it, though?

757
01:22:16,952 --> 01:22:19,512
- Yeah, too bad.
- Yeah.

758
01:22:20,755 --> 01:22:21,755
Yep.

759
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:25,282
- I wonder who was behind it?
- Oh, a fire don't need nothing behind it.

760
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,158
Fire has a way of moving
on its own. Here's how.

761
01:22:31,065 --> 01:22:34,001
Before I drink with you, Judge, I want
to know you had nothing to do with it.

762
01:22:34,069 --> 01:22:36,537
Me? Why, how can you
say a thing like that?

763
01:22:36,671 --> 01:22:38,229
Didn't I round up all
them cattle for you?

764
01:22:38,306 --> 01:22:40,638
Wasn't I right here in the
saloon when the fire broke out?

765
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:41,971
Didn't...

766
01:22:44,345 --> 01:22:47,872
Well, I was, and what's more,
I ain't got no idea who done it.

767
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:50,974
Now, drink up.

768
01:22:56,323 --> 01:22:58,291
- Don't you believe me?
- No.

769
01:23:01,528 --> 01:23:06,431
Now, listen, son, I told you how it was,
and I don't want you calling me no liar.

770
01:23:07,635 --> 01:23:09,262
Now, drink hearty.

771
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:13,940
Will you swear by that?

772
01:23:15,541 --> 01:23:17,635
There ain't no reason I
should, but I'm willing.

773
01:23:18,145 --> 01:23:21,410
All right, I swear by my sword
there I had nothing to do with it.

774
01:23:21,814 --> 01:23:23,213
I swear by the revised statutes.

775
01:23:23,783 --> 01:23:25,979
By gobs, if there was
a Bible in town I'd...

776
01:23:26,086 --> 01:23:27,644
Where's that lock of hair?

777
01:23:29,256 --> 01:23:31,746
- Right here with me.
- Let me see it.

778
01:23:41,701 --> 01:23:42,700
Swear on that?

779
01:23:47,373 --> 01:23:49,705
All right, it was me. I
burned their houses and crops.

780
01:23:49,809 --> 01:23:52,369
- I run them varmints out.
- Nice going.

781
01:23:52,445 --> 01:23:53,445
And if you think...

782
01:23:56,148 --> 01:23:58,174
If you think I'm sorry, you're crazy.

783
01:23:58,251 --> 01:24:00,650
I'm proud and glad I
rid the country of them.

784
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:04,246
It was either them or us, and now
the range grass will grow back,

785
01:24:04,323 --> 01:24:06,450
and some day, the cattlemen
will put up a statue of me

786
01:24:06,525 --> 01:24:08,494
out there on the street,
and they'll write on it,

787
01:24:08,561 --> 01:24:11,826
"Judge Roy Bean, he
give us back the land. "

788
01:24:15,033 --> 01:24:16,398
You get warrants in
Fort Davis, don't you?

789
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:17,560
Yeah, that's where they get them,

790
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:18,864
but they don't know
how to spell my name.

791
01:24:18,937 --> 01:24:20,768
- It's been tried before.
- I'll get one.

792
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:24,099
This time, you're going to get
what's coming to you, Judge.

793
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:28,371
Cole!

794
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:32,943
You and me's friends. I done what I
had to, and you think it was wrong.

795
01:24:33,018 --> 01:24:35,542
But if it was my own son
come over here with a warrant,

796
01:24:36,021 --> 01:24:37,818
he'd have to be first on the draw.

797
01:24:38,522 --> 01:24:42,926
I aim to be, unless I get it in
the back before I get out of here.

798
01:25:25,735 --> 01:25:27,033
So long, Cole.

799
01:25:38,581 --> 01:25:40,412
Make out a warrant against Roy Bean.

800
01:25:43,019 --> 01:25:44,611
Raise your right hand.

801
01:25:45,187 --> 01:25:47,213
Do you solemnly swear to carry
out the duties of deputy sheriff

802
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:49,019
in Jeff Davis County
in the state of Texas?

803
01:25:49,092 --> 01:25:50,091
Yep.

804
01:25:55,364 --> 01:25:56,365
Thanks, Sheriff.

805
01:26:19,955 --> 01:26:21,388
How much are tickets?

806
01:26:21,457 --> 01:26:24,254
$2 apiece, all over the house.
First come, first served.

807
01:26:24,726 --> 01:26:27,251
- How many seats in the house?
- Four hundred.

808
01:26:27,329 --> 01:26:29,228
- I'll take them.
- How many?

809
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:30,696
All of them.

810
01:26:43,612 --> 01:26:44,611
Much obliged.

811
01:26:46,047 --> 01:26:47,446
Let me have two tickets.

812
01:26:57,091 --> 01:27:00,322
If I was you, Judge, I wouldn't set
foot in Fort Davis to see Adam and Eve.

813
01:27:00,394 --> 01:27:01,394
Me, either.

814
01:27:01,462 --> 01:27:04,260
A deputy's star makes the
finest kind of a target.

815
01:27:04,732 --> 01:27:07,599
How you know you're
not heading into a trap?

816
01:27:07,668 --> 01:27:09,727
Sure looking for trouble,
going over to Fort Davis.

817
01:27:09,804 --> 01:27:10,804
Taking an awful chance, Judge.

818
01:27:10,905 --> 01:27:13,135
<i>Them hombres just waiting
down there for you.</i>

819
01:27:13,206 --> 01:27:16,642
Why, you pack of yellow
bellies, give me them tickets.

820
01:27:24,418 --> 01:27:26,079
You mean, you're going
to Fort Davis alone?

821
01:27:26,154 --> 01:27:27,815
Not by a jugful, I ain't.

822
01:27:27,888 --> 01:27:29,788
You're all going with
me as a guard of honor,

823
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:33,121
right up to the opera house,
but I'm going in alone.

824
01:27:33,193 --> 01:27:35,889
I don't want nobody in
there with me no how.

825
01:27:35,963 --> 01:27:38,863
I ain't sharing the
Jersey Lily with no one.

826
01:27:39,266 --> 01:27:41,131
Now, come on, we got a
day's ride ahead of us.

827
01:27:41,201 --> 01:27:43,692
I'm going to dress, and you
fellows proud yourselves up a bit.

828
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:45,635
Chickenfoot, my sword.

829
01:28:08,694 --> 01:28:11,390
I ain't wore this
uniform since Chickamauga,

830
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:13,394
but it still fits right smart.

831
01:28:19,738 --> 01:28:22,639
Bean and his men are
coming! Get off the street!

832
01:28:24,109 --> 01:28:26,236
Bean and his men are coming!

833
01:28:34,687 --> 01:28:37,383
Bean's coming! Bean's coming!

834
01:28:53,705 --> 01:28:54,705
Hey, look!

835
01:28:57,308 --> 01:28:58,639
They must have heard I was coming.

836
01:29:13,424 --> 01:29:15,289
All right, boys, take your places.

837
01:29:24,735 --> 01:29:26,168
Hey, this is the stage entrance.

838
01:29:30,174 --> 01:29:32,573
Now, remember, I want strict
privacy all during the show.

839
01:29:32,809 --> 01:29:34,299
You'll get it.

840
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:52,261
Third seat in.

841
01:30:11,947 --> 01:30:15,644
- Pardon, sir, your seat is back here.
- No, it ain't. It's right here.

842
01:31:01,396 --> 01:31:04,490
Say, when does Miss
Langtry go on the play?

843
01:31:04,899 --> 01:31:07,390
Right after the curtain.
She's about to go up now, sir.

844
01:31:07,469 --> 01:31:09,630
- Go up?
- The curtain, sir.

845
01:31:25,653 --> 01:31:26,812
Now?

846
01:31:28,122 --> 01:31:29,817
Yes, now.

847
01:31:33,494 --> 01:31:34,654
Now.

848
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:04,287
Don't make a move, Judge.
I'm coming down to get you.

849
01:32:05,691 --> 01:32:06,692
Come shooting.

850
01:32:41,593 --> 01:32:42,855
- The war's on.
- Yeah.

851
01:32:42,928 --> 01:32:44,987
Wish I was in there to see that show.

852
01:32:45,263 --> 01:32:48,027
- I bet the judge is having
a good time. - Yeah.

853
01:34:08,511 --> 01:34:09,511
Hey!

854
01:34:11,114 --> 01:34:13,344
Let's you and me stand
up and shoot it out.

855
01:34:15,418 --> 01:34:17,215
That suits me, Judge.

856
01:34:19,088 --> 01:34:21,215
Put up your gun. We'll draw.

857
01:34:22,058 --> 01:34:23,058
All right.

858
01:34:29,298 --> 01:34:31,027
- Ready?
- Yeah.

859
01:35:06,134 --> 01:35:08,067
Now, you see what you done?

860
01:35:09,438 --> 01:35:10,438
You stopped the show.

861
01:35:11,672 --> 01:35:13,698
I was going to see Lily.

862
01:35:18,412 --> 01:35:20,506
Now it's too late.

863
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:22,910
No, it isn't, Judge.

864
01:35:23,751 --> 01:35:26,219
She's back there now,
waiting to see you.

865
01:35:29,323 --> 01:35:30,415
What?

866
01:35:31,525 --> 01:35:34,722
She knows all about you,
Judge. She wants to meet you.

867
01:35:34,795 --> 01:35:36,763
She told me so herself.

868
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:41,958
Come on, let's go back and see her.

869
01:35:48,676 --> 01:35:49,870
My hat.

870
01:36:18,571 --> 01:36:19,571
Where's Miss Langtry?

871
01:36:21,107 --> 01:36:23,075
Put me down. I can walk.

872
01:36:24,277 --> 01:36:27,110
Put me down, I tell
you. That's my ruling.

873
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:19,890
Miss Langtry, I'd like to present
an old admirer. Judge Roy Bean.

874
01:37:26,170 --> 01:37:28,968
I'm pleased to meet you.

875
01:38:32,501 --> 01:38:35,266
Cole, come here quick!

876
01:38:40,010 --> 01:38:41,009
Look!

877
01:38:46,015 --> 01:38:48,109
See, what did I tell
you? They're coming back.

878
01:38:49,285 --> 01:38:50,809
Wagons by the score.

879
01:38:52,321 --> 01:38:53,754
It's the promised land.

880
01:38:54,757 --> 01:38:55,757
Jane Ellen,

881
01:38:57,326 --> 01:39:00,887
someday, Texas is going to be
the biggest and the finest...
