6
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,040
And the best food in Paris
according to some

7
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,160
it is the one of the chef Gusteau.

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,840
Gusteau's Restaurant is
the rung most of Paris.

9
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,360
They are five months for
make a reservation

10
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,360

French gastronomy,

11
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,680
it let their competitors

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,680
enviously

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,360
He is the youngest boss
to conquer

14
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,160
the quotation five stars.

15
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,200
The cookery book

"Anyone it can cook"
it is in the top of the list of 'best-sellers'.

17
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,960
But neither all of them commemorate
your success.

18
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,200
interesting title.

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,520
Anyone it can cook,
and the most interesting is that Gusteau

20
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:41,560
it seems to believe. Already my idea
it belongs that cookery is serious thing.

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,240
And not,  I do not believe that any
one can cook.

What is my problem?

27
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,920
First, I am a mouse.

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,560
And mouse's life

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,880

46
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,400
It was there that my father saw that the
my talent was not useless.

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,040
It was super happy with my gift,

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,680
until my father me
give a work.

49
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,680
Cleaned.

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,680

51
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,760

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,800

53
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,080
Very clean,

54
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,080

55
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,680
it understood, limpissima is almost...
it lets prá there.

56
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,880
it can pass.

57
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,400
It is my father was proud,

58
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,600
so,  it does not feel better, Remy?

59
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,160
Heim?

60
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,120
You helped in a noble cause,

61
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,000
Noble?

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,680
It is not that daddy

63
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,400
and what we rob,
it is... practically garbage.

64
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,360
Catch what anybody

65
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,520
it wants is not to rob,

66
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,960
if anybody it wants,
because that we robs.

67
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,960
We will tell that we has
different points of view

68
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,440
I find this way.

69
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,920
If we is what we eats,

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,320
Then I only want to eat
of the good and of the better.

71
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,880
But pro of mine father

72
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,880
food is combustible,

73
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,160
if choose too much what places
in the tank the motor dies and does not catch anymore.

74
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,960
Now shuts up
and your coma garbage ouch.

75
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,680
If we is same thief

76
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,440
why we does not rob
things good there in the kitchen?

77
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,240
it at least does not have
poisoned food.

78
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,000
First
we are not thieves.

79
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,040
In place second,
stay outside the kitchen

80
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,240
and far from the humans,
it is dangerous.

81
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,200
I know that oughted to
hate the humans, but...

82
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,760
they has a special thing

83
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,280
he do not survive

84
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,080
they discover,
they create.

85
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,960
A good example
they do with the food,

86
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,600
as I can describe.

87
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,960
The good food is as musica
which if proof, color that if smell.

88
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,320
your excellence return,

89
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,920
it is alone to stay pay attention
and to appreciate the flavors.

90
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,640
Oh! Gusteau is right

91
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:04,641
Oh! hum...

92
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,960
Oh, hum, what a delight.

93
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,680
Each flavor is unique.

94
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,320
But, join a flavor with another,

95
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,520
and it have a thing new.

96
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,800
Now I had a secret life,

97
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,200
the only that knew about this was Emile.

98
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,480
Emile, Emile, found a mushroom.

99
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,280
It comes here, you are good to hide food

100
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:49,280
help me to find a hiding place prá that.

101
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,480
He does not understand me

102
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,480
but for he need not pretend.

103
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,360
why you are in
walking this way, heim?

104
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,360
I do not be in order to keep washing
my feet all hour.

105
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,960
Already it noticed that we
it uses the feet to walk,

106
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,960
to hold food

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,840
and then it places everything in the mouth

108
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
always.

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,920
In the hour to eating do not want to feel
the dirt of my feet.

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,920
Oh! You is that knows,

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,600
but if the father Ihe picks walking
this way,  it is not going to like.

112
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,400
what that do you have ouch?

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,080
Oba, he, he, E.

00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,000
It found cheese

115
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,640
hum! and it is not a cheese any.

116
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,080
It is of the better,

117
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,440
he will get delicious
with my mushroom.

118
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,960
OH! with that rosemary,

119
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,160

120
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,560
oh! I do not know, perhaps with one
pinch of this anise here.

121
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,640
Good. Join this gororoba ouch.

122
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,640
After this we eats.

123
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,280
Tá crazy,  I do not am going to let
that here in this dirt.

124
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,760
That is special.

125
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,440
But we have to come back for
the colony before the sun if put.

126
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:48,440
Or else daddy goes...

127
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,360
Emile, we are in front of
unexplored possibilities,

128
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,560
we have to cook this already.

129
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,520
Now as we cook,
this is the matter.

130
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,200
here the secret is to rotate,

131
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,040
prá everything smoke well

132
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,400
for equal...

133
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,040
Tá coming a tempest.

134
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,160
Ouch! Emile, it will be that it is not a holed

135
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:14,161
we tá so close to her

136
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,120
OH! You have to try,

137
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,120
it is the flavor, which...

138
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,960
burning, melts,
kipper until not tá.

139
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,960
it has a touch of...
it is almost.

140
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,880
Perhaps should

141
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,160
only that did,

142
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,160
so?

143
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,160
Which flavors does it think it has?

144
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,560
Lightning that leave you

145
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,640
it is great, lightning that leave you

146
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,560
OH! We has to do
that again, it is the maximum.

147
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,480
In the next tempest
we goes up in the roof.

148
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,440
Already I know what fault

149
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,440
saffron.

150
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,000
A saffron pinch will fall well.

151
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,640
Saffron, I am with the impression

152
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,200
which you want to be there in the kitchen.

153
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,400
Saffron

154
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,640
I do not have liking.
Saffron.

155
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,800
I do not find grace.

156
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,800
that crown is going to awake.

157
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,720
I was here a million times.

158
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,920
She poe in a cookery channel

159
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
bum, never more awakes.

160
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,000
Was it here a million times?

161
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,320
It is that ouch, saffron is what it lacked.

162
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,720
Gusteau uses all hour.

163
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,760
Who is Gusteau?

164
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,200
It is the best chef of the world,
which wrote this kitchen book.

165
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,400
Pe... Pe... perái! Do you know how to read

166
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,440

OH! Peralá, daddy does it know about this?

170
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,320
with things that daddy does not know.

171
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,240
The books exist,
and it is because of this that I read them

172
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,160
Is this our secret?

173
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,560
secret is not legal

174
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,120

why that do I let?

179
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,320
Cadê the boys
why so much delay.

180
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,120
OH! saffron of Aquila, is
Italian.

181
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,920
Gusteau said that it is excellent,

182
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,840
fortunately the crown
it likes culinary.

183
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,720
Look Emile, that is Gusteau.

184
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,520
See

185
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,200
The good cookery is not
for the weak of heart

186
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,840
it is to creative minds,

187
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,800
strong hearts,

188
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,160
The things until can give wrong

189
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:29,161
but they do not let anybody define their limits

190
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:30,160
starting from your origin

191
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,800
the only limit is your soul.

192
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,440
what I say is true,

193
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,760
anyone it can cook
but only the ones that has courage,

194
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,160
always stand out

195
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
pure poetry.

196
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,040
But the success lasted little,

197
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,720
Gusteau's Restaurant

198
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,240
it lost one of their 5 stars.

199
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,920
after the ravaging criticism of the
larger gastronomic critic of France

200
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,080
Antoine Dego

201
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,240
It was a hard blow for Gusteau

202
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,960
and the depressed boss died
little time after.

203
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,760
And for tradition, with your death

204
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,800
your restaurant loses other star.

205
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,120
Gusteau is dead.

206
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,720
God

207
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,560

208
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,240

Which way should take?

238
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,880
I waited.

239
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,880
The noise.

240
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,400
A voice.

241
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,200
A signal.

242
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,000
Anything

243
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,560

244
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,400

248
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,960
How it knows about this?

249
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,440
Good, I...

250
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,120
You are an illustration,

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,520
It well lost your family
and all your friends.

252
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,120
It is alone.

253
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,280
well, and you died,

254
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,640

to who has willpower

255
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,560
if just to look back

256
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,960

258

Sometimes! I have hunger.

261
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,960
I do not know where I am,

262
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,040
and I do not know will find food
again.

263
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,440
It is not what should do.

264
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,640
It is a cook.

265
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,040
And the cook prepares,

266
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,760
and the thief catches.

267
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:25,761
But you are not a thief.

268
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,600
But I have hunger.

269
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,560
The food will come, Remy.

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,160
All this time, was

They advance 2 salmons, 3 composed salads
and 3 tenderloins.

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,040

I prepared more 2 barbecued salmons.

292
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,760

295
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,920
Preparing the 3 salmons.

296
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,960

Boss sees, eye who arrived.

300
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,920
Alfred Linguini.

301
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,960
It is the son of Renata that boy.

302
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,760
Hey.

00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,960

00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,440
It remembers Renata,
old girlfriend of Gusteau.

305
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,920
It was the nephew of Gusteau

306
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,680

315
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,880

316
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,240
OH! ouch what a pity

317
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,640

318
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,520
She believed in the sky
then she gave well

319
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,960
It withdrew, life after the death.

320
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,720
what is this here?

321
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,600

326
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,120
for here.

327
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,520
But clear, Gusteau not
I had doubts of this

328
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,840
which any son of Renata...

329
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,240
We will keep this letter
and if arise a place

330
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,080
in the kitchen...

331
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,080
- Already we hire him.
- what

332
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,080
As if it dares?

333
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,840
To hire someone
without my permission?

334
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,960
We needed someone
to take the garbage.

335
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,360
Oh!

336
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,920
Garbage! well?

337
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,960
How good that got your place.

338
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,000
Mr..

339
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,440
I do not believe.

340
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,520
Being in the kitchen of a great boss,
where I can observe.

341
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
Did you read my book?

342
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,000
We will test
their knowledges, tá.

343
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,040
Which of them is the boss?

344
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,840
Oh! That there.

345
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,360
Very good, who is the
do according to to command?

346
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,120
It is sub-boss.

347
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,160
That.

348
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,600
sub-boss is the responsible person
by the kitchen when the boss is not in

349
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,120
The 'sau-cier'* which cares for of the sauces,
very important.

350
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,800
for party boss

351
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,440
which takes care

352
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,440
of prepare directly
the food.

353
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,360
It is very important

354
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,040
Oh, it is an intelligent mouse.

355
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,800
And now who is that one?

356
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,720
OH! he!

357
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,760
It is not anybody.

358
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,080
nobody not, he works on the kitchen.

359
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,560
It is who it takes the garbage.

360
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,520
Which lava the cymbals or
they clean do not cook.

361
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,240
But it could.

362
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,480
Oh! AhAh!.

363
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,720
No.

364
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,680
How is just that it knows?

365
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,880
What is my slogan?

366
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,480
Can anyone it cook?

367
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,760
Tá, tá. Anyone it can
but neither all of them would ought to,

368
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,440
Sometimes by the visa

369
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,360
he does not want neither to know.

370
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,080

I only am your mind's fruit.

378
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,120
But he is ruining the soup.

379
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,880
We needs to warn someone.

380
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,200

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,920
Disorderly of a fig?

00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,880
Is it cooking?

399
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,040
As if it dares to cook
in my kitchen.

400
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,200
But that petulance?

00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,440

00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,560
Soup?

410
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,200
Stop this soup.

411
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,440

She wants to talk to the boss.

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,080
I hey, hey...

419
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,760
what for client did it tell?

420
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
She was not a common client

421
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,160
Is she journalist?

422
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,160
And now

423
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,520
Soline Reads Claire

424
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,560
It reads Claire.

425
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,200
what he said?

426
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,920
She liked the soup.

427
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,400
It waits.

428
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,640
As it thus waits

429
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
did you put me in this holed?

430
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,560
Someone this praising
your soup

431
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,560
Which is your little joke?

432
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,760
I...,

433
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,120
Did I continue fired?

434
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,360
It ca not fire him.

435
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,320
what

436
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,680
It reads her Claire liked the soup,

437
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,760
she let very clear that liked.

438
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,160
it praises in the criticism and discovers
which sent the boy although.

439
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,840
He is a young boy of the garbage

440
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,720
which did a soup that she likes.

441
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,000
As we will be able to honor
Gusteau's Name

442
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,240
we do not follow the principle
his more important?

443
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,040
And that principle is this one, miss?

444
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,520
Anyone it can cook.

445
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,400
maybe I have been
a little rough with new garbage man

446
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,840
our young boy.

447
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,520
He has much courage
and that

448
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,600
should us reward
thus with

449
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,600
the boss Gusteau would have done.

450
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,120
If he whether if risk in a
more dangerous service

451
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,040
because prevent,

452
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,400
You was going to run away from

453
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,440
OH! yes.

454
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,520
since it demonstrated interest
in his career here in the kitchen.

455
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,680
It can if consider responsible.

456
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,440
Anybody more?

457
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,200
So, come back to the work

458
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,840
You have much luck
or much fault of her,

459
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,120
it will do the soup again

460
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,960
and this time will pay attention

461
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,240
very closely

462
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,640
It thinks it can be cook

463
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,840
you know what I find Linguini.

464
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,480
I believe that it does not pass of
shabby and miserable

465
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,400
mouse.

466
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,960
Linguini picks something
with which it can hit him.

467
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,000
Of me something

468
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,000
Catch him.

469
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,960
what I do now?

470
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,480
Mat him!

471
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,000
Now?

472
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,520
No, in the kitchen not,

473
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,280
soft crumb?

474
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,400
You know what would happen discover
which kill mice in the kitchen,

475
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,240
we seriate interdicted.

476
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,720
Our reputation this being threatened.

477
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,880
Carry him to far from here

478
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,640
very fast.

479
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,400
Mat him and discard itself of him.

480
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,120
Go soon!

481
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,920
OH! lightnings.

482
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
I do not me look thus

483
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,480
It is not the unique that this in a mess
they want me to cook again

484
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,400
This option was not mine

485
00:29:00,401 --> 00:29:01,640
It did not want to cook,

486
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,520
it only wanted to stay far
of confusion

487
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,560
but it convinced them
with the spices

488
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,440
what it poured there?

489
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,040
Oregano?

490
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,200
No?

491
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:10,600
what

492
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,920
Rosemary?

493
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,400
Is that spice not?

494
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,320
Rosemary?

495
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,040
It poured there the rosemary?

496
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,320
Then what I was that all that
you played and placed there.

497
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,160
God!

498
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,640
That job is important for me,

499
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,640
Already I lost so many before...

500
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,440
Neither I know how to cook

501
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,400
and in addition talking
with a mouse.

502
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,160
As if

503
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,200
had he understand me

504
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,240
Do you have me listened?

505
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,400
Did you move the head?

506
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,880
Then I do not be crazy.

507
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,480
Wait a second

508
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,960
I do not know how to cook

509
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,480
or I know?

510
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,360
But you

511
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,560
you know, né?

512
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,080
Do not be modest

513
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,960
although it is a mouse,

514
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,520
I do not know what it did
but they liked.

515
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,680
It is can even work

516
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,880
see, they liked the soup,

517
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,680
they liked the soup.

518
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,480
It believes that it can do
again?

519
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,120
OK!, so, now will let
you loose

520
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,800
but we this together in this.

521
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,840
Né?

522
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,120
Then tá.

523
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,720
Come in!

524
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,520
What a thing!

525
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,400
I ca not believe in this.

526
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,440
So, it is here

527
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,120
it is not much thing
but it is...

528
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,200
it understood, a meleca.

529
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,520
It could be worse,

530
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,480
it has light, heater, sofa, TV.

531
00:31:57,481 --> 00:32:00,000
The house is your, stay for wish.

532
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,040
You?

533
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,040
Is it that a dream?

534
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,360
I am the best kind of dream.

535
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,800
what we can divide.

536
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,480
But why here?
why now?

537
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,560
why not here?
why not now?

538
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,360
 is there better place to dream?

539
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,080
Than Paris.

540
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,000
Good, boss

541
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,600

542
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,480
Oh! no.

543
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,080
Idiot, it knew that
this would happen.

544
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,360
A mouse in my house

545
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,680
and he said that the house was of.

546
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,960
the eggs were already,

547
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,600
stupid, it robbed the food
and we sent

548
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,600
It is that that gives,

549
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,360
when trusting in a mouse.

550
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,360

551
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,520

552
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,440
Hum! Tá good.

553
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,480
what it placed here?

554
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,560
Where it got?

555
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,480
See, it is delicious,

556
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,720
but it do not rob.

557
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,960
I will buy some spices, tá legal?

558
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,240
Oh! no, we is going to if be late

559
00:33:28,241 --> 00:33:29,280
soon in the first day.

560
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,520
We go going!

561
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,800
even though I and another critical
we were not appreciating

562
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,160
Gusteau's, since the death of the great boss.

563
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:39,080
The soup was a revelation

564
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,840
it is very tempered, and to the same
time subtilenesses inundation.

565
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,280
Was it what it wrote to Reads Claire?

566
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,480
Causing surprised Gusteau's has
captivated our attention.

567
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,000
Only time will tell if such function
it is deserved.

568
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,840
Good

569
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,040
you know.

570
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,440
Look me know that it is nonsense
stupid and strange

571
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,000
but we ca not
do that alone,

572
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,480
we have to do it close
right?

573
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,960
Purchase this fight?

574
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,000
Then do!

575
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,080
Oh!

576
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,560
OH! God.

577
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,680
Devils!

578
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,960
Welcome to the hell

579
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,200
where we will recreate the soup.

580
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,600
It has all time that need.

581
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,200
Give you until a week.

582
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,720
Soup.

583
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,360
God.

584
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,560
This is not going to come out right
chefinho.

585
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,760
I go pirar work
thus

586
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,400
we have to plan some
other thing.

587
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,640
A thing without bites
scratches, races

588
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,760
or scraping my body
doing me tickles.

589
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,280
Nothing of biting, neither to scratch.

590
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,880
Do not scratch, OK!

591
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,440
It understood chefinho?

592
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,920
Chefinho?

593
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,800
OH! is it hungry

594
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,040
All right

595
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,720
See further on

596
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,280
You know how to cook and I know
as to behave me

597
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,320
like people.

598
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,840
We will plan an outline
so that I

599
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,240
it can do what you want

600
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,120
without seem to be being controlled
for a small mouse...

601
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,840
Pay attention at me!

602
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,720
I am crazy.

603
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,160
I am in the butcher shop
talking to a mouse.

604
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,440
Linguini?

605
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,720
we has to if communicate.

606
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,120
does not give to keep waiting you
balance the head telling yes or not

607
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,840
a mouse.

608
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,680
I saw.

609
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,680
A mouse?

610
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,960
Yes, yes, a mouse

611
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,960
very close of you.

612
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,960
are what you tá doing here?

613
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,880
I am alone trying to know better
the vegetables, you know

614
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,040
and the greens, understood?

615
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,920
It scrams from here!

616
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,480
Much knowledge
of the vegetables times is not good.

617
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,240
It passed scraping

618
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,880
All right ouch on top

619
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,960
OH! it goes...

620
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,760
I'm sorry

621
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,360
How it saved me of this?

622
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,160
They are involuntary reflexes,

623
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,200
here,

624
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,040
we looked and I realized,

625
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,360
our crazy idea was the same

626
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,360
OK!

627
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,360
No.

628
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,200
It where is carrying me

629
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,360
Wait.

630
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,000
Stop.

631
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,720
No.

632
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,040
Wait,  we are not preparing food.

633
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,680
All right

634
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,680
All right

635
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,760
For your health.

636
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,080
It seems that it is going to work?

637
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,640
My congratulations.

638
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,160
It managed to repeat the
your accidental success.

639
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,880
But it needs to do more than a soup
if you want to survive in my kitchen, expensive.

640
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,440
Collete will be responsible to for teaching the
you as we work here.

641
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,240
It listens,

642
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,560
I only want knows
as I feel honest

643
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,920
of learn with a teacher as...

644
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,000
No, listen you,

645
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,680
I only want knows exactly

646
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,480
with who is working.

647
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,160
How many women sees
in this kitchen?

648
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,160
Good, I not...

649
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,080
I am the unique

650
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,400
why it will be heim?

651
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,080
Well I think ...

652
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,600
because gastronomy has a hierarchy
old-fashioned of writings rules for

653
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,000
stupid and old.
For men.

654
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,480
Rules maids to prevent
which the women enter this world.

655
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,680
But still am here

656
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,800
how will be that that happens?

657
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,400
Uai! because I find
which you,

658
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,800
I am in excess bully
in this kitchen,

659
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,600
I worked weighed much time
to arrive here

660
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:54,600
and I do not am going to deteriorate everything for
cause of a cleaner that gave luck

661
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,200
tá?

662
00:40:59,201 --> 00:40:59,991
Gee!

663
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,520
Easy of cook
easy of eat

664
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,560
the food Chinese do Gusteau's
it is a business of the

665
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
China?

666
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,360
Excellent work, François

667
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,440
as it belongs to habit.

668
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,560
It is worthwhile, right?

669
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,640
It agitates a campaign for mine
newer line of frozen

670
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,040
covered little dog Gusteau'S.

671
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,840
It is just that neither a
covered hot dog,

672
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,400
or as he would tell, only how smaller,
gives for a bite.

673
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,840
Uai! how come

674
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,600
Oh! they are sausages croquettes
fried in the spit.

675
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,680
It understood, thing of American,

676
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,760
it is alone a campaign.

677
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,240
It can be a Gusteau's Puppet
with suspenders and a legal hat.

678
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,000
or holding a plaquinha with
expensive of fleas sack.

679
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,680
But please

680
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,320
with dignity.

681
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,560
My lawyer.

682
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,240
See: The testament specifies
which if after a period 2 year

683
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,560
from the death, none

684
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,160
heir the restaurant Gusteau appear's
it will pass for sub-boss.

685
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,280
of him, in this case:
you!

686
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,440
I know what tells his testament

687
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,720
I only want to know it is if this letter,
if that dumb young boy something

688
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,960
they are not very seemed,

689
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,760
it is not similarities things

690
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,080
it is not son of Gusteau.

691
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,080
Gusteau did not have sons.

692
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,880
And he appears on this
inconvenient moment

693
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,360
the specified term expires
in less than a month?

694
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,520
It suddenly arises a young boy
with a letter

695
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,600
of the mother who died recently,
alleging that Gusteau is his father.

696
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,080
Attitude much suspicion.

697
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,280
Does that belong to Gusteau?

698
00:42:57,281 --> 00:42:58,281
It is, it is yes.

699
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,000
Can I?

700
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,880
Oh! Clear, clear.

701
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,600
But the boy does not know about this.

702
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,120
She tells that it never counted prá he.

703
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,160
Neither for Gusteau.

704
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,960
And it asks that I do not count.

705
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,720
why you

706
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,720
what she wants?

707
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,840
A job,
for the young boy.

708
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,120
Just a job?

709
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,440
Then why if you worry?

710
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,560
If he work here

711
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,640
it will be able to stay of eye in him
while I do

712
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,240
an investigation
prá know if that is true.

713
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,360
I need that it gathers samples
of boy's DNA.

714
00:43:24,395 --> 00:43:24,805
A hair thread.

715
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,120
It writes what I am going to tell,
this history is all suspicion.

716
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,360
He knows about something

717
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,280
Relax it is alone the young boy
which takes the garbage.

718
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,200
You gives tells of.

719
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,560
what tá do it do ouch?

720
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,000
I have cutting vegetables.

721
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,040
Only cutting,

722
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,080
no, it is spending energy
and time.

723
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,400
You find sweet to cook, né?

724
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,280
just like the mom in the kitchen

725
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,680
only that the mothers do not face
an allotted restaurant

726
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,360
full of asked,
with cymbals of the varieder

727
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,200
and that they need to arrive
the client's table,

728
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,920
exactly at the same time
hot

729
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,600
and that are perfect,

730
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,440
each second counts

731
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,040
and you are not the mom.

732
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,600
what is this?

733
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,840
keep your stove without mess.

734
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,320
When they arrive the requests

735
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,120
what happens?

736
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,640
The mess is late it
the food does not leave.

737
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,760
The requests accumulate
it is a disaster.

738
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,840
I am going to help you to to be liberated of this.

739
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,320
keep your stove without mess,

740
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,560
or I give you a beating!

741
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,640
Oh! Look the sleeves,
it seems that it vomited.

742
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,960
Keep the agglutinated hands to the body,
thus looks here!

743
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,840
Always comes back to
this position.

744
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,440
we are agile, work
with sharpened knives.

745
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,760
then paste the arms together
to the body, thus we do not cut

746
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,800
neither if burning and
their sleeves are clean.

747
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:35,801
The mark of a boss

748
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,040
it is dirty apron
and clean sleeves.

749
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,000
I know Gusteau's Style
in each

750
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,360
dish of the boss Gusteau
always has something unexpected.

751
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,280
I show you

752
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,000
I decorated all
his revenues.

753
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,560
Always do something
unexpected. No

754
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,200
always follow the revenue.

755
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,360
But you had just told
No, no

756
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,680
no, unexpected thing was with him,

757
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,000
we have to do
what is in the revenue.

758
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,680
As it knows when the bread tá good
without tê him proved?

759
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,160
It is not the appearance, neither the smell,
it is by the sound of the peel. It listens

760
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,960
Oh! What a crispy symphony.

761
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,960
quality alone bread
it makes a noise this way.

762
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,440
The best ingredients
they are the of the 1st delivery of the day.

763
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,440
prá catch these only has two ways:

764
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,840
produce them or bribe the producer.

765
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,920
Voila,
the best restaurant can choose

766
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,040
everybody thinks 
gastronomy is snobbish.

767
00:45:24,441 --> 00:45:26,320
Because of this it is just that has many snobbish people.

768
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,440
but neither so much, Lalo eye,
it ran away from home

769
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,120
at the age of twelve

770
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,760
It was hired by a circus
like acrobat,

771
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:36,760
and after fired
for paquerar the daughter of the owner.

772
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,760
Horst!

773
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,160
it was already prisoner.
why

774
00:45:40,161 --> 00:45:41,140
Does nobody here know?

775
00:45:41,141 --> 00:45:43,900
It counts a different history
every time Ihe ask.

776
00:45:44,001 --> 00:45:45,600
Gave an embezzlement in a great company.

777
00:45:45,601 --> 00:45:47,760
I robbed the 2nd France's Largest Bank,
just using a ball pen

778
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,680
I did a hole in the ozone layer,

779
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,080
under O. line
I killed a

780
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:52,960

781
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,600
with this thumb.

782
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,880
Never plays at cards with Pompidou,

783
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,880
it was already expelled of Las Vegas

784
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,480
and of Monte Carlo.

785
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,120
Larousse supplied guns for the
resistance

786
00:46:03,121 --> 00:46:04,180
which resistance?

787
00:46:04,481 --> 00:46:06,960
he does not tell,
I find until they were defeated.

788
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,640
it only saw

789
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,520

790
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,520
pirates.

791
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,360
We are more than cooks,
né? We?

792
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,000

798
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,840
for accepting

799
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,800
A mouse

800
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,840
but, he, he...
I let fall

801
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,800
my key.

802
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,120
They wish to do their asked now?

803
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,880
Your soup is excellent.
Well

804
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,760

We have a great foigrass.

807
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,680
Yes, I know foigrass, but
it wanted something better.

808
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,720
what it has again
from this boss?

809
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,840
They want to know about the dish new,

810
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,880

He said that I was going to ask

819
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,440
it is so simple,

820
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,640
it is alone to push an old revenue
of Gusteau, one that is not recent.

821
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,160
they know all the cymbals of house,

822
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,200

They are asking the food
of Linguini?

825
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,000
Lots of clients like the soup,
it was alone what we said.

826
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,240
Very good

827
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,160
it is Linguini who they want,

828
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:37,320
talk that the boss Linguini
it prepared a special dish.

829
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,840
for them, a dish that
still is outside the menu.

830
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,320
but,  do not forget to emphasize that
it belongs to the Linguini.

831
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,360
Oui! Mr..

832
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,480
This is your chance of trying something
worthy of your special talent.

833
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,840

We will work, the clients
they are starving.

838
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,000
Is it sure
this revenue is a disaster

839
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,040
Gusteau always told this.

840
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,840
this is challenge the kind that
a future boss needs.

841
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,880
Offal La Augusto:

842
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,240

00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,000
dry white mushrooms

848
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,280
and Anchovy sauce.

849
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,040
Ouch! I do not know this revenue,
but it belongs to Gusteau,

850
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:24,600
so...

851
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,360

This is the revenue,

871
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,640
and the revenue does not carry
oil of white truffle?

872
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,720
It is improvising

873
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,200
It is not time to improvise

874
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,200
the clients are waiting.

875
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,000

887
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:43,960

894
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,240

The boss does not go to ask most
advices prá you, né Collete.

940
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,920
I thought would not see it

941
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,240

943
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,040

00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,560

946
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,600

00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,440
Remy, it is going to rob.

949
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,560
He said to the Linguini to trust you.

00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,840
He can trust,
I am going to give prá of mine brother.

951
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,560
It is but the boy can lose the job.

Calm, tá everything
under control, tá good?

953
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,800
Does little wine go?

00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,560
Should not drink but, tá legal!

955
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,560

Oh! Tá legal.

959
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:44,440
It does not hope that I believe that this

960
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,040
- It was not.

961
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,000
It is my 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th time.

962
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,400
The 1st time was in the Monday.

963
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,560
But I took the garbage
many times before.

964
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,320
Yes, yes, I know, it serves more wine ouch.

965
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,080
Tell me, Linguini which ones are
their interests?

966
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,760

Sometimes the commonest, dogs,
cats, horses, pigeons

970
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,240
or mice?

971
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,760
He brought some things

972
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,440

973
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,240
I have to teach you
all about food?

974
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,200
Close their eyes,

975
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,560

976
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:28,440
Not not,  it does not thread in the throat.
it was already.

977
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,760
Pick,

978
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:36,080
savor very slowly.
it concentrates on flavor.

979
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,480
Oh! It felt?

980
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,800
Not really.

981
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,160
Creamy, the acre-sweet, a nuts touch

982
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,240
It felt now?

983
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,400
Nuts is already madness né!

984
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,240
Close their eyes,

985
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,080
now proves this one.

986
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,600
very different from other né,

987
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,280
sweet, lightly bitter
a custard.

988
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,280
Tá legal!

989
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,840
Now, try both

990
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:01,480

991
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,960

00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:09,960
that is

996
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,640
imagine everything of pleasant of the world
forming infinite combinations.

997
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,720
things that

998
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,640
nobody tried yet,
and neither they were discovered.

999
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,640
I think I...

1000
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,560
Yes?

1001
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,040
I do not have understanding anything else

1002
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,240
Oh!

1003
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,120
But it was doing well interesting,
the most interesting garbage that I...

1004
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,440

Everybody is going to be happy.

1007
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,320
Yes, but...

1008
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:31,840

1009
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,800
The business is that I have, have to, that...

1010
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,440
what is more important
than the family?

1011
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,880
what is more important, heim?

1012
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,480
Good,

1013
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,360
A visit does not do badly to anybody.

1014
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,280
care for an estimate mouse?

1015
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,080
No

1016
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,600
It worked on a laboratory with mice?

1017
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,600
No.

1018
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,040
Suddenly already it lived in the dirt?

1019
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,240
No, in the, Nina, no.

1020
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,760
You know anything about mice?

1021
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,160
Do you know about this?

1022
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,680
That is blood pudding that I eat in the service.

1023
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,680

1024
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,200

Ratatouille 'Mouse tattoo".

1028
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,520
That is a stewed né.

1029
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,200
why did Ihe give that name?

1030
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,800
When gives a name to a food has
which give one  informing be delicious.

1031
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,200
Ratatouille is not name of delicious food.

1032
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,720
It is a mouse's mixture.

1033
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,160
With tatui,

1034
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,760
Ratatui

1035
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,360
Of delicious that does not have anything.

1036
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,200
unfortunately

1037
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,680
it finished all our stock.

1038
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,720
My son

00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,880
disaster,

1042
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,320
we do not catch anything poisoned
fortunately, but

1043
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,920
it has not been being easy.

1044
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,840
You did not facilitate anything.
I know about this,

1045
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,840
I apologize daddy

1046
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,240

1050
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,920
It was food of less or will be
which was freshness of more?

1051
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,440
It is difficult to survive in this mundão
it came without alone gate, né!.

1052
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,520
Clear but it is also just that do not be
one more nestling,

1053
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,560

I found a place to live, and I come

Is not it going to stay?

1061
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,160
No.

1062
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,200
It is not anything too much father, it is alone that I...

1063
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,000
You did not think I was going to stay
prá always. It thought?

1064
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,160
The little birds finish going out from the nest, né.

1065
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:58,040
We are not birds. We are mice,
and we do not let our nests.

1066
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,000
We increase our.

1067
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,200
maybe I am a different kind
of mouse.

1068
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,640
maybe are not a mouse.

1069
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,880
It can be a thing good.

1070
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,280
It is ouch! The band tá maneirissima today, né?

1071
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,000
Mice

00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,800

1073
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,800

1074
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,240
I want to do things.

1075
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,240
I want to give something for that world.

1076
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,000
it talks as a human.

1077
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,920
they are not bad how you tell.

1078
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:16,400
Oh! it is!

1079
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,000

1080
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:22,000
OH! for caning observá them, well, well...

1083
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,640
Is it, how much closely

1084
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,520
A lot

1085
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,720
and they are not so bad

1086
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,720

1087
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,480

look with much attention, Remy.

1098
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:21,160
It is what happens when a mouse stays
a lot for close to the human wish.

1099
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:25,520
the world in which we live
Pertence to the enemies.

00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,040
We look after the well-being
of our species, Remy,

1102
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,040
because in the long run

1103
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,640
we do not have anything else

1104
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,880
No!

1105
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,280

00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,240
No, father,  does not give prá believe.

1107

Tá telling prá me that the future is,
it only can be, this slaughter?

1108
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,560
It is as soon as the things work.

1109
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,080
It ca not change the nature.

1110
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,480
Nature tá always in change, father.

1111
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:05,000
This responsibility has to be our,

1112
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,520
to start by our own attitudes.

1113
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,400
It where goes?

1114
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,200

Ei, ei, ei, ieia!

1118
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:16,680
Good morning

AhAhAh! For being forgive me coming in
in your personal relation with the boss.

I know how is,

1126
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:49,360
I taught you some culinary malices prá
dazzle the boss and now ignores me

1127
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,920
It awakes, it awakes!

1128
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,040
I thought .

1129
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,000
you were different.

1130
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,200
And that you found me different.

1131
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,560
I had not to help you

1132
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,640

1133
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,160

1134
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,200
But, gee...

1135
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,360
it wanted to see you win.

1136
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,040
I liked you.

1137
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,000
I am regretful.

1138
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:20,760

1139
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,040

01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,720
OH! It finished chefinho.

1141
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,880
I do not be standing more.

1142
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,240
Colette!

1143
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,560
Perai,  do not go away of moto.

01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,240
Colette.

1145
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:33,560
Eye,  I do not be good with words,
I do not be good at kitchen as well.

1146
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,560
at least not without your help.

1147
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,360
I hate false modesty

1148
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,080
it is alone other appearance of lying.

1149
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:40,760

1150
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,640

1151
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,400

When I placed those ingredients in
time of following the revenue with you said

1153
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,680
I did not decide,, as well.

1154
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:51,920
How come

1155
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,360
It can believe that he would not have done anything
I, I would have

1156
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,160
followed the revenue,

1157
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,480
he would have followed what you said.,

1158
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,120
He would have followed you until the end of the world.

1159
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,960
because I love

1160
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,320

1161
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,320

1162
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,080
but, I.,

1163
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:06,840
It does not count.

1164
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,120
I have a secret

1165
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:13,560

Then tá! I am going to open the game...

1178
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,920
You inspires me

1179
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,240
I am going to risk everything.

1180
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:54,240
I am going to run the risk of seem
the most idiotic madman that already saw.

1181
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,480
You know because I learn so fast.

1182
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,440
You know because I cook so well?

1183
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,960
Do not debauch,
I will show you.

1184
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,040
No,

1185
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:54,000
what was Grossio,

1186
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:57,480
Gusteau's is going to close the doors finally.

1187
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,160
No,

1188
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,600
Problems with the accounting?

1189
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,240
No

1190
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:05,640
They launched salty for personal computer-waves.
what, what, go desembucha soon.

1191
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,960
It is just that tá in the fashion.
It came back to fame.

1192
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,600
For years Gusteau's
it does not receive my criticisms.

1193
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,000
My last condemned it
to a restaurant from 5th.

1194
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,160
Yes Mr.!

1195
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:24,120
I wrote: Gusteau finally found
the place that deserves in the history

1196
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:30,240
together there is other so famous boss
how much he the Mr. Boyardi

1197
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:30,840
It's true

1198
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,520
It was my critical last

1199
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,320
it was my final word

1200
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,680
the last word

1201
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,720
Yes Mr.

1202
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,520
Then tell me Ambrósio

1203
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:44,680
how it come back could to fame?

1204
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:49,520
no, no, no, no, no, nããããããão.

1205
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,560
The DNA agrees.

1206
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,680
right age,
everything very well.

1207
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,000
It is the son of Gusteau, yes!

1208
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,160
But that it ca not happen.

1209
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,960
Everything in this history is a fraud

1210
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,080
the boy knows.

1211
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,280
Look him there, pretending
which is an idiot.

1212
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,920
He plays with my mind as
a cat plays with a ball of...

1213
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:07,840
I know there what

1214
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:08,520
Of wool?

1215
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,280
It is, he supports the fool

1216
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,920
provoking me with that mouse.

1217
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,720
Mouse?

1218
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,200
It is, it is as if it was his consultant.

1219
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,200
He wants to do me believe
which the animal is important.

1220
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,400
The mouse?

1221
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,360
Exactly

1222
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,160
and is that mouse important?

1223
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:24,680
Of course not

1224
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,040
he only wants me to think that the mouse is

1225
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,720
OH! Already I understood all the woof,

1226
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,120
a mouse appears in his 1st night,

1227
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,360
I sent kill

1228
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,600
and now, it wants sees the mouse in everywhere

1229
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:37,920

1230
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,360
not there! I am sell things
I pirei.

1231
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,280
There is or not a ghost mouse

1232
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,440
but, OH! No

1233
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,480
I refuse to take part
of this infamous joke.

1234
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:47,760
Boss,

1235
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,960
I had to worry with your sanity

1236
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,120
mental, no?

1237
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,120
I ca not send him away

1238
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,120
it is doing a damaged success

1239
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,360
if he goes to the street now,
all of them are going to ask me

1240
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,640
because, and the last thing

1241
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,720
which I want is that distrust

1242
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,840
why is it so worried?

1243
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,400
Is not it good to leave in the press?

1244
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,320
It is not good have the name of the
Gusteau's in the headlines?

1245
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,000
They do not show his the guy.

1246
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:34,400
Gusteau already has a guy,
she is fat, loved.

1247
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:35,560
family

1248
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,480
and it sells burritos.

1249
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,720
Million and million of burritos.

1250
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,920
The term expires in three days

1251
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,920
ouch it will be able to fire him
when it is not more useful

1252
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,880
and anybody is going to know about anything.

1253
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,320
I was worried about the exhibition
of hair that the Mr. gave me

1254
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,960
I sent analyze again in the laboratory.

1255
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:53,640
why

1256
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:58,320
Because in the first time identified
as by the of rodent.

1257
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,480

1258
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,400

1260
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:22,400
Good

1261
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,160
It sits down ouch?

1262
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:48,680

1263
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,880
disgusting animal!

1264
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,560
They did me remind the how much
all that was fail.

1265
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,560
Like the world me really saw

1266
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,040
And when we thinks 
worse than tá ca not stay.

1267
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:19,720

1268
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,800
Hey! Hey! Hey! My little youngest.

I thought prá they I could count.

1276
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,080
Look, me sorry.

1277
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,600
If apologize is no use,
if sorry with them and if authority

01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,920
Tá rolando some problem

1279

No, not tá.

1280
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,400

It has to go pass there now.

1362
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:06,280
Mr. wrote down the information
if someone cancel, advance the visit

1363
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,640
but the mice

1364
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,720
it has to go there.

1365
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,360
He swiped my documents.

1366
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,200
Already it passed the hour to opening.

1367
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,560
It is, he should have finished it has already been a hour.

1368
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,040
Hey! Hey! Hey! Good jour mon cherry.

1370
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:22,040
It sits down ouch

1371
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:23,960
we are talking about the inspiration of my life.

1372
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,880
Is him calls chefinho.

1373
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:29,640
Not wanted the inspiration is you.

1374
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,360
Look it is the EGO.

1375
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:42,120
You are the Mr. Linguini

1376
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,760
hi! Forgive interrupt

1377
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:47,160
your immature celebration.

1378
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:50,960
But I thought should give
to Your mr. great chance

1379
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,160
since it is new in this game.

1380
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,960
Oh! Game?

1381
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:59,120
It is, and the Mr. has been playing without an opponent.

1382
01:17:59,121 --> 01:18:04,120
And that as already should know
it is thwart the rules.

1383
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:06,320
You are EGO

1384
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:11,240
The Mr. is dull, as
it manages to go up quickly?

1385
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:15,360
And the Mr. is a rod, as
it manages to like food.

1386
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,080
It is not to like eating, it is to love.

1387
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,960
And if I do not worship,
I do not gobble.

1388
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:33,120
I will come back tomorrow by night
with great expectations.

1389
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:36,160
I hope that I do not me disappoint

1390
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,840

1392
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,760
It is at dinner
and we are French.

1393
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,680
Do not look thus for me not.

1394
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,720
You stayed distracting me
in front of the press

1395
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:59,400
As it is just that me went concentrate
do with you pull my hair stop

1396
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,960
And it has one more thing.

1397
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,720
your opinion is not the unique
which tells around here

1398
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,120
Colette knows how to cook so well, no?

1399
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,720
Tá legal already arrives.

1400
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,680
Rest a little chefinho,

1401
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,200

01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:19,760
and you are not one of those
expensive that control the marionettes.

1403
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,800
Oh! the mouse is the cook.

1404
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,240
Cool the head and face
the situation chefinho.

1405
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,760
The EGO tá coming
and I have to concentrate me

1406
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:30,720
Foolish

01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,040

01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,840
Gee, never had seen that.

01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,120
they know. it is well,
I was a little selfish

1413
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,080
Are they hungry

1414
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,760
dinner is for my account.

1415
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,040
We will enter after to close.

1416
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,200

1423
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:54,320
Chefinho.

1424
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,240
Oh! Hi chefinho.

1425
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,120
I thought I had returned to the apartment.

1426
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,240
Ouch as I did not see you there

1427
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,240
I.,.

1428
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:04,520
I do not know

1429
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:08,080
I think I talked things
which did not ought to, so

1430
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,360
I have suffering much pressure, understood.

1431
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,760
I had much pressure
lately

1432
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:17,800
It changed so much thing in so little time

1433
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,800
you know suddenly

1434
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:19,960
I will become a Gusteau

1435
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,400
I have to be a Gusteau

1436
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:24,560
Or else the people are going to be disappointed

1437
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,640
and that is eccentric, understood.

1438
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:29,800
I never disappointed anybody even today
because as well

1439
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:32,560
nobody waited great thing of me.

1440
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,800
and the only reason for someone
wait something now

1441
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,640
it is because I have you.

1442
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,040
I have been being very unjust

1443
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,320
you never were mistaken with me
should not have forgotten about that

1444
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:47,760

1447
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:03,000
Perai, you are robbing food

1448
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:04,720
how could it?

1449
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,320
I believed that you was my friend

1450
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,840
I trusted you

1451
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:08,760
It scrams and it carry

all their friends
and it do not come back

1453

You are right father.

1456
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,280
What an ingenuousness.

1457
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:28,400
we are what we are

1458
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,240
and we are mice

1459
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,800
Good he already is going to leave and
you already know come in.

1460
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,320

1482
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,120

I am going to call daddy.

1491
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:12,560
You can if find a boss

1492
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:16,120
but it continues to be
always a mouse.

1493

01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:47,480
You will create for me a new line
of frozen of the boss Skiner.

1508
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:14,520
see so many exaggerated praises
about your new cook

1509
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,800
You know what I am going to want

1510
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:20,800
a small perspective.

1511
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,040
Only that.

1512
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:26,040
I want a new perspective
clear and very tempered.

1513
01:25:26,041 --> 01:25:29,040
Which wine does it suggest accompanying

1514
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,720
Do accompany what

1515
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,360
Perspective one that is new.

1516
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:35,400
I

1517
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:39,520
very good, since it is
without any perspective

1518
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:44,280
and anybody in this city seems have
there you have my proposal

1519
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:48,760
You supplies the food,
I supply the perspective.

1520
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,760
which falls very well with a bottle
of Cheval Blanc of 1947

1521
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:58,480
Unfortunately, oh, OH, yours
meal which is going to be?

01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:03,280
Tell to your boss Linguini who
I want what he to dare serve me

1523
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:07,840
Tell him who I serve me what
she does of better.

1524
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:14,560
I am going to want the same
which the gentleman there.

in the suitcase of a car.

Waiting the future in the
branch of frozen food.

1552
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,440

1553
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,560
why do you worry

1554
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:40,760
Because I am the cook.

1555
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,760
The revenue is your, as it is just that
do know the own revenue?

1556
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,160
I did not write it

1557
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:55,840
I created in the hour.

1558
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:59,320
Then it goes have to remind
because that is not going to give prá serve.

1559
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,120
Cadê my request?

1560
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:01,280

Did not anything that I invent?

1562
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:03,800
But the request is this one.

1563
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,000
Authority they ask other thing.

1564
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:06,200
Warn that already it finished.

1565
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:08,200
Does not give prá tell that,
we have just opened

1566
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:11,040

I do not remind what I did.

1569
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,240
We has to tell some
thing for the clients.

1570
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,080

01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,880

1582
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,120
the truth that's it

1583
01:28:58,120 --> 01:28:59,680
I do not have talent

1584
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,000
but this mouse

1585
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:05,000
it is the responsible person for
all those revenues.

1586
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:05,800
He is the cook.

1587
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:07,320
the true cook

1588
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,800

1589
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,240
he controlled my actions

1590
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:18,120
it is thanks to he who I prepare the
cymbals that enchant the clients

1591
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:20,640
it is because of his that
the EGO tá there in the salon.

1592
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:24,040
you gave prá me the
recognition by his talent.

1593
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:26,080
I know that it is difficult to believe

1594
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,920
but and thence, you believed
which I cooked, né!

1595
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:34,800

01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:38,120

in Paris

1597
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:41,960
and this mouse, this brilliant chefinho

1598
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:43,680
it is who it can do that.

1599
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,000

1600
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:46,160

Father! I do not know what to tell!

1603
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:44,200

for you?

1611
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:12,160
We are not cooks,
but we are a family.

1612
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,360
It is alone to tell what to do that we will do.

Less salt, more butter,

Only use the cheese provolone,

1631
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:00,240
Do the sauce as if
they painted a picture.

1632

Do not put much vinaigrette
in this composed salad.

01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:06,800
Do not let that back separated,

Legal, too much salt!

1638
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:13,920
Good!

1639
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,160
Do not deteriorate the sweet.

1640
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,680
- Emile!
- It was hardly!

1641
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,440
Colette waits!

1642
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:25,240
Colette, came back prá me.

1643
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:26,240
Colette, I...

1644
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,880
it does not talk anything

1645
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:32,600
if I think am going to change mind
do only tell me what the mouse wants to cook?

1646
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,840
Ratatouille

1647
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,040
peasant dish.

1648
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:40,880
you want same
serve this here, pro EGO?

1649
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:00,120
what is?

1650
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,480
I am doing ratatouille.

1651
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,160
Then how would you prepare?

1652
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,560
Ratatouille

1653
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,120
should be a joke.

1654
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,520
Who did Ratatouílle?

1655
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:36,880
I demand know!

1656
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,940
I do not remind when it was
last time that I asked the

1657
01:36:46,941 --> 01:36:49,240
a waiter to give
my congratulations to the boss.

1658
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:54,360
Now I am in an extraordinary situation
because my waiter also is the boss

1659
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:58,280
Thanks, but I am only the waiter today.

1660
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:01,640
I thank who by the food to?

1661
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:03,760
Oh! Just a little minute.

1662
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:16,640
Should you be for boss?

1663
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:20,880
it wants to know the boss goes have to
wait all the clients anger although.

1664
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:23,880
Then it can be.

1665
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:48,280
First EGO thought I was a joke.

1666
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:53,760
But as soon as Linguini explained
the EGO smile disappeared.

1667
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:03,880
He did not sketch reaction and
it only did some questions.

1668
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:06,120
And when the history finished

1669
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:13,240
EGO got up thanked the food
and it went away. without telling anything else

1670
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:16,840
The next day

1671
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:19,320
It published your criticism

1672
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:25,960
In a way the work
of a critic is easy.

1673
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,560
We risk us little

1674
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:32,640
and we have pleasure evaluating with
superiority the ones that submit us

1675
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:35,120
your work and reputation

1676
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,800
we win fame with negative criticisms

1677
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:40,560
which are fun of write and to read.

1678
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:44,480
But the hard reality that
we critical should face

1679
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,520
it is just that in the picture general

1680
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:53,440
in excess simple filth perhaps
be more significant than

1681
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:54,960
our criticism

1682
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:59,480
But times a critic
it risks in fact something

1683
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:03,120
as when it defends and
it discovers a novelty.

1684
01:39:03,121 --> 01:39:07,120
The world is used to be hostile
to the new talents

1685
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:11,280
the new creations,
the new needs to be encouraged

1686
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:15,040
Yesterday by night I tried something new

1687
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:17,120
an extraordinary dish

1688
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:20,120
of an unexpectedly singular source.

1689
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:26,600
Tell that both the dish and who did it
they defy my perception about

1690
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:29,560
gastronomy is extremely superficial.

1691
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:32,840
They managed to shake my structure.

1692
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:37,000
In the past I did not do secret
how much my disdain

1693
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:38,920
by the famous slogan of the boss Gusteau

1694
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,200
Anyone it can cook.

1695
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:48,840
But I realize that only now I comprehend
really what he meant

1696
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,760
Neither all of them they can become great artists

1697
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:57,480
But a great artist
it can come of anywhere

1698
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,880
It is difficult to imagine the humblest origin

1699
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:03,640
of this genius that now cooks in the Gusteau's

1700
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:08,560
Which is in the opinion of this critic

1701
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:12,680
nothing less than the best boss of France.

1702
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:18,240
I will come back to Gusteau's
soon with much hunger.

1703
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,040
It was a great night.

1704
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:21,800
in excess happy of my life.

1705
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:26,480
But the only previsible thing in the
life is that she is unexpected.

1706
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:29,800
Ah!Ah! We had to loosen
Skiner and the sanitary inspector.

1707
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:32,680
And clear that they denounced we

1708
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:34,360
The food did not matter.

1709
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:36,720
as soon as it was published
which there were mice in the kitchen.

1710
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:38,960
Oh, the restaurant was closed.

1711
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,880
And the EGO lost the job
and the credibility.

1712
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:44,160
But they do not get sad for him not.

1713
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:46,000
He tá super well

1714
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,760
now that invested in a small business.

1715
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:49,160
It seems that it is very happy.

1716
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,080
How it knows about this?

1717
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:50,720
It is

1718
01:40:57,960 --> 01:40:59,840
Oh! Should go

1719
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:00,760
dinnertime

1720
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:09,880
You know how he likes.

1721
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:16,600
It was worth chefinho.

1722
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:26,760
You would like to prove
a dessert today?

1723
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:27,760
Clear that I prove,  it?

1724
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,640
And which does you wish?

1725
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:32,680
Surprise me

1726
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:47,840
Look, they will go for me, this history
it is better when I count, tá!

1727
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:53,200
Should stop eating so much.

1728
01:41:54,305 --> 01:42:54,574
