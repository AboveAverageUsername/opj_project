No.

10
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,860
If you had, would you still have gone?

I don't know.
I try not to think that far ahead

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,960
Yeah.

22
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,801
Yeah. I saw one walking down

They're all out of their goddamn minds

29
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,100
Yeah! ah!

30
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,580
What do you miss most from home?

31
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,220
Home-cooked meals.

32
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,460
Whose cooking?

33
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,580
My mom.

34
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,120
Vic, this is actual.
What's your status?

35
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,240
Taking the greens to 37.

36
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,920
Be advised we have enemy
contact to the south.

37
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,920
Drop the greens. Return to mako.

38
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,300
Get out.

39
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,880
What are you talking about?
Where are we?

40
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,600
Do you have a map?
Yeah.

41
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,400
- Get out.
- Go.

42
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,100
Hurry up! It's getting dark!

43
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,340
I was away at school during the invasion.

44
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,840
And, um, my home got hit.

45
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,540
And so i didn't have anywhere to go back to

46
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,560
What are we supposed to do now?

47
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,980
Frankie, fall in.

48
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,900
Andros, let me see the map.

49
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,900
You thinking twice about signing
up?

50
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,200
- No, sir.
- Good. Take point.

51
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,060
There was action here.

52
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,680
Yeah. Recently.

53
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,620
How recent? Doesn't matter.
Let's go. Eyes up.

54
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,920
You got to be fucking kidding me.

55
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,120
And when you saw the outpost,
what were your first thoughts?

56
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,680
That we should turn around,
try and make it back to mako on foot

57
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,460
Regardless of the punishment.

58
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,960
Fuck. You think they got hit?

59
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,620
I got a bad fucking feeling
about this, man.

60
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,680
Doesn't matter.
We can't stay here.

61
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,940
Let's go.

62
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,560
Frankie!

63
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,960
O.p. 37, this is specialist
omohundro, over.

64
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,820
Is there anything on the walkie?

65
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,760
Shut up.

66
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,720
O.p. 37, this is specialist
omohundro, over.

67
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,680
I don't know what's up.
Then why the fuck are we going in?

68
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,260
It's the only place we can go

69
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,420
Okay, here's the gate.
Andros, you blow the lock.

70
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,560
Im gonna go west.
Andros, you take east.

71
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,420
Frankie, cover us with reds.
Expect heavies.

72
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,360
Set?
Set.

73
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,660
Fuck!

74
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,800
It's one of ours!
Let's get in there!

75
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,140
Watch out for friendlies.

76
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,580
Muzzle discipline, clean shots
only, conserve ammo.

77
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,500
Set?

78
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,820
- Set?
- Set.

79
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,040
Go!

80
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,960
Fuck you, you bastards!

81
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,640
I got you, you pieces of shit!

82
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,640
Fuck you!

83
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,040
Take that, you pricks!

84
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,480
Piss off! Go back to your bloody
fucking home planet you fucks!

85
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,400
- Friendlies at 7:00!
- Covering fire!

86
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,300
Bloody hell!
Who the fuck are you, mate?

87
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,700
Reinforcements.

88
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,200
- Reloading!
- Get that saw back online!

89
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,440
I got movement at 10:00!
Where the fuck are they?

90
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,220
- I can't see shit!
- I'm out!

91
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,880
Get that saw back online!

92
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,580
What the fuck is going on?!
I don't know, mate, okay?

93
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,000
These blokes arrived and began fucking shit
up, started shooting everything insight

94
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,320
Drop your weapons!
Names now, shitheads!

95
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,520
Sir, specialist
alex omohundro, sir.

96
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,600
Do you have any idea what the
penalty is...

97
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,620
Entry to this outpost?!
What the fuck are you

98
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,341
What the fuck are you looking at?

99
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,640
Grab those cameras!
Give me the fucking camera!

100
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,380
Hands up!

101
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,400
What are you looking at, dick breath?!

102
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:14,400
All right.
I can't do this anymore.

103
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,340
See the look on their faces?
The little one shit himself.

104
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,960
Oh, dude, i smelled it.
Sorry, guys. sorry, guys.

105
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,520
Just a little joke the men like
to play on the new arrivals.

106
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,520
Hey, hey, it's okay.
Son, you're gonna live, okay?

107
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,100
I'm lieutenant grant North.
Welcome to the 37, boys.

108
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,160
- Where are you from?
- Sebring, florida.

109
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,860
Shitload of old people out there,
like the rest of florida.

110
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,340
Smells like oranges.

111
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,920
I hate oranges. And what do you
miss most from home?

112
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,860
How many women have you seen since
you've been here that weren't a blanket

113
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,080
None. Well, there you go.

114
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,960
What will you do when your
tour here is complete?

115
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,960
Going to disneyland.

116
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,180
Hey. The commander wants to see

117
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,580
Okay.

118
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,400
Holy shit, man.
Are these the new vl-624s?

119
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,200
Yeah.

120
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,720
We're gonna put them up around the base
wireless upload like our main cameras

121
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,380
Low-profile.
U.h.d., right?

122
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,080
Yeah.

123
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,360
Uh, you mind?

124
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,360
Uh... sure, okay.

125
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,380
You might want to get moving.
Spears ain't patient.

126
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,020
Hey.

127
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,120
So, what's up?
I have no idea.

128
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,180
I was unpacking, and Mac came and got me.

129
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,540
Look at this place. Looks like he can
fight his own personal war.

130
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,020
What the fuck is this?
A relic from the first invasion.

131
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,000
First invasion?

132
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,500
There's only been one.
There has only been one...

133
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,120
- So far.
- Take a seat.

134
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,400
You mind if we ask you some
questions about the f.e.w.?

135
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,060
Some other time. Right now, i need you
to understand the situation

136
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,100
37's positioned in the most
dangerous part of the world.

137
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,520
We're attacked here daily.

138
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,677
Local resistance and
heavy presence is higher

139
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,625
here than any other
outpost on the planet.

140
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,020
This isn't like any other outpost.

141
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,660
When you're here, you fight.

142
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,900
Well, with all due respect,
sir... - keep your respect

143
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,820
Save you asses.
Geneva doesn't exist out here.

144
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,220
When you're within these walls,
you're a combatant.

145
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,820
I refuse to lose one man because
you weren't armed. Do i make myself clear?

146
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,661
Sir, we're...
I said, do i make myself clear?

147
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,500
Sir, we're journalists, not soldiers.

148
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,660
Everyone became a soldier 10 years ago,
whether they liked it or not

149
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,000
Now take your weapons.

150
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
That'll be all.

151
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,620
Yeah, i got goat coming out
of my fucking ears.

152
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,600
Which one of you hicks shot this one, huh?

153
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,280
Yeah, couldn't you shoot
something that tastes good?

154
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,741
Hey, man, i ain't never seen
you pass up a meal, fat boy.

155
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,080
Whites only.

156
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,940
Omohundro, hey, you did good yesterday.

157
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,660
This is for you.
Look how he's eyeing him.

158
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,620
That ain't omo. That's "homo."

159
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,100
Aw, i think bones is jealous.
Aren't you, bones?

160
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,060
Hey, man, keep your hands off my shrimp
and your eyes off my barbie huh?

161
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,377
Bones, if you could fight
half as well as you

162
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:28,485
talk, this war would have
been over years ago.

163
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,720
Where were you during the invasion?

164
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,220
Man, i was held up with my boys in a-t-l.

165
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,140
I was hoping that they would run
up on our street.

166
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,320
You think the heavies will
attempt another invasion?

167
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:49,614
No, man, they can't get past
the sariffs.

168
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,520
- Sariffs?
- Orbital defense sentries.

169
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:12,477
My, um... my squad was
stationed in North korea before the attack

170
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,877
rebuilding, securing the new
government, that sort of thing.

171
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,833
And, uh, Spears was my c.o.

172
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,077
Anyways, i remember i was in

173
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:24,966
Um... i was in new pyong when
the... the news came on.

174
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:29,566
It said that there'd been some
natural disaster, some shit,

175
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:31,700
Brazil, in port velho.

176
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:37,366
And this was june 13th, 2021?

177
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,766
I mean, there wasn't
much coming out at first

178
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,788
You know, other than velho
was apparently destroyed

179
00:13:45,922 --> 00:13:49,188
but about a day later, more
reports started coming in...

180
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:52,966
more cities destroyed...

181
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,411
Millions... millions dead.

182
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:06,966
And then the real shit hit the fan
an invasion, aliens.

183
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,211
It just... didn't seem real.
Yeah, go.

184
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,366
Yeah, go. You're off.

185
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:20,788
- What the hell?
- No, you're off, dude.

186
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:23,455
Check your wind. It should be on 3.

187
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,322
All right.
All right, watch it now.

188
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:33,722
Very good.

189
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,122
All right, big guy, one more step.

190
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,855
There we go. And... there.

191
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:49,655
What the fuck happened?
I can't feel my leg.

192
00:14:49,944 --> 00:14:52,188
I got bit by that thing,
and i can't feel my leg.

193
00:14:54,188 --> 00:14:57,322
It's a numb bug. Little fuckers
came down with the heavies

194
00:14:57,611 --> 00:15:01,255
That's what i told him.
Is there something you can give me?

195
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:03,744
I could piss on it for you.

196
00:15:04,255 --> 00:15:05,077
Yeah.

197
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:07,433
- Will that help?
- No.

198
00:15:08,122 --> 00:15:09,966
But i can't feel my foot.

199
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,140
Why do you think they call it
a numb bug, numb nuts?

200
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,144
Here. Get the fuck out of the way.

201
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:21,255
It'll go away in a couple hours.
But you can go away now.

202
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:26,744
Boys, that is a house that is full.

203
00:15:30,477 --> 00:15:34,344
I am foxtrot, uniform,
charlie, kilo, echo, delta.

204
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:38,877
What does that mean?
He's fucked.

205
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:43,411
They said they took fire
almost every single day.

206
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,766
So i knew it was gonna come
sooner or later.

207
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,366
Were you ready for it when it came?

208
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:50,944
Hell, yeah.

209
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:58,188
Looks like that joe has seen
a lot of action.

210
00:16:00,188 --> 00:16:03,255
Yeah, he has.
It's my son's.

211
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,388
How old is he?

212
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,322
Him and my wife were in
Chicago during the counteroffensive.

213
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:15,766
- What, you were there?
- No.

214
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:17,966
That's why i'm still alive.

215
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,788
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

216
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:25,900
Eyes up! Brick, get on that fucking 50!

217
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:31,655
I'm already on it, sir!

218
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,766
Get up on those! Move!

219
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,522
I got these guys to the east!

220
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,900
All right, got it!
You got grenades?

221
00:16:52,966 --> 00:16:54,255
Yeah.
Get them out.

222
00:16:55,522 --> 00:16:57,522
Get down! Get down!

223
00:16:57,655 --> 00:17:00,700
- From behind!
- Nice going, Harty!

224
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,388
Got two tangos getting close!
Fuck you!

225
00:17:08,855 --> 00:17:11,877
Hold the wall!
There you go!

226
00:17:12,344 --> 00:17:17,833
200 yards!
Come on, motherfucker!

227
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
I see you, nigga!

228
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:25,944
Yeah, boy! Fuck, yeah!

229
00:17:27,677 --> 00:17:30,033
Incoming!

230
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:32,633
We got a man down!

231
00:17:32,988 --> 00:17:34,722
- You okay?
- Yeah.

232
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,411
Now you're in the 37, man.

233
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:41,388
Watch those fucks on the left!

234
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,655
Left! Medic!

235
00:17:49,011 --> 00:17:50,522
Wilks! I got you.

236
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:53,077
You're all right.
Don't touch it.

237
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:56,255
Just lay back.
Got that camera, omo.

238
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:58,988
Mortar!
Incoming Mortar!

239
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
I need to look at this.
Here we go. All right

240
00:18:02,722 --> 00:18:04,055
- Stay.
- Zilla!

241
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,633
- Straight.
- Zilla!

242
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:08,544
- Zilla!
- I need you.

243
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:13,544
Outpost 37, actual, this is dirty bird.

244
00:18:13,566 --> 00:18:15,722
We are standing by for paint-on target.

245
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:19,655
Zilla, put the rim down!
Spot that target!

246
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:20,722
Copy that, sir!

247
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:32,633
- You good?
- Yes, sir.

248
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:34,922
Get that scope back up!
Let's go!

249
00:18:35,722 --> 00:18:39,500
Hey, look at them run.
Hey, look at them run.

250
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:46,322
Y'all see that shit?!

251
00:18:51,611 --> 00:18:53,655
Smile for the camera, brick.

252
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:56,855
Now you're in.

253
00:18:57,966 --> 00:19:01,522
Frankie, that's 37 for you,
baby, that's 37.

254
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,922
Why did the locals attack the base?

255
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,701
I thought the interhuman conflict ended
in this region after the heavies invaded.

256
00:19:07,788 --> 00:19:08,433
It did.

257
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:14,966
But, you know, post-invasion, we needed
to ensure the safety of humanity

258
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:16,922
So the outposts were commissioned.

259
00:19:18,077 --> 00:19:20,211
Unfortunately, we encroached on
their sovereignty.

260
00:19:22,055 --> 00:19:25,611
Well, for a decade, they put up
with it, but, um,

261
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,220
But, um, patience must
be wearing thin, huh?

262
00:19:28,322 --> 00:19:30,522
Look at me. look at me, duke.
Squeeze my hand.

263
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:32,011
Okay.

264
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,677
- Hold on.
- Fuck!

265
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:37,344
I can't get it, not here, not like this.

266
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,611
Take it out. Take it out.

267
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,477
Duke. Relax.

268
00:19:41,544 --> 00:19:42,700
Relax. You'll die.

269
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:47,633
You did good.
All right, take him out.

270
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,522
Yes, sir.

271
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:52,966
- Hey.
- Set, boys?

272
00:19:53,411 --> 00:19:55,166
Move fast. Get him to that base.

273
00:19:55,522 --> 00:19:56,966
Don't come back till daylight.

274
00:19:57,211 --> 00:19:59,731
Listen, you're gonna be two men down.
What if they attack again?

275
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,544
Don't worry about that.
They won't.

276
00:20:01,877 --> 00:20:03,655
You just see to duke, okay?

277
00:20:03,988 --> 00:20:07,300
Three, down. And bring back supplies.
We need all the ammo they can give us.

278
00:20:08,411 --> 00:20:10,011
- Good.
- Be safe.

279
00:20:10,922 --> 00:20:12,077
You, too, brother.

280
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:14,011
You're gonna be all right, Duke.

281
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,033
- Duke.
- Nice work, fellas.

282
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,460
Uh, geographically, uh, we're in the
dmz between pakistan and Afghanistan.

283
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,120
It's an area that was largely
controlled by these local tribes.

284
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,580
And the heavies
retreated here after the invasion.

285
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,840
And we followed.

286
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,260
So, he's gonna be okay.

287
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,720
But he's done here.
They're sending him to lyon to cover.

288
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,180
Motherfuck.

289
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,600
Listen, guys.

290
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,140
You did well.

291
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,320
And Duke got hit doing his job.
That's all.

292
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,620
Do this long enough, we all get hit.

293
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,560
So let's get back to it.

294
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,700
I want patrols around the base all day.

295
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,059
Zilla, it's your turn.

296
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,699
Take the rooks.
Get rid of the bodies.

297
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,439
Sir.

298
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,600
The rest of you, that's all.

299
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,520
That's the worst we've ever
seen from the locals.

300
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,280
They're gearing up for something.
Might try to finally push us out

301
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,400
They can't take on the
heavies without us.

302
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,259
We need more men.

303
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,160
We won't get them.
I put a request in this morning.

304
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,359
The answer was negative.

305
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,280
Fuck.

306
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,320
So, what do you want to do?

307
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,640
Tell Mac to bring Saleem in.

308
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,979
Let's see what he knows.

309
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,139
Back in the initial fighting
of the f.e.w., our ground

310
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,312
They struggled to kill...
hell, even injure...

311
00:22:17,338 --> 00:22:19,185
the heavies. They're
big fuckers, huge.

312
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,120
They got a thick armor, too

313
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,360
Made from some metal we don't
have here on earth.

314
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,220
Makes them slow, but they're
still walking tanks.

315
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,760
So, our weapons weren't effective?

316
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,400
You could barely bring one down.

317
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,980
Finally, Darpa got their
hands on a couple of

318
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:38,025
dead ones and researched
a new type of round.

319
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:43,020
HIPRS, high impact
phosphorous rounds... "Reds"

320
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,980
It's like having, uh, 10 bullets in one.

321
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,940
Say you fire one, right?

322
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,640
The bullet flies, hits
the target, explodes,

323
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,060
Fires another bullet, like those,
uh... those Russian cup things.

324
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,440
Tears through the armor and
fills them with a burning phosphorous.

325
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,420
Nasty.

326
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,300
Smelling shit.

327
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,100
Dude, you're a pervert.
You know that?

328
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,380
Oh, damn!

329
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,420
God, i almost feel guilty about this.

330
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,819
Look at this.
Surgical hands, baby,

331
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,319
Surgical hands. Look at that.

332
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,840
Just gonna give her a little facelift.

333
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,840
I'm wiped.

334
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,400
Burn what we got so far and
take five.

335
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,600
They're finished marinating.

336
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,080
Any of you guys got a light?

337
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,540
You close to Duke?

338
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,500
Yeah. He's a good soldier.

339
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,360
I bet you he pulled so much
wool with that damn aussie accent.

340
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,880
Frankie, maybe that's what you should do.

341
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,399
You should fake an accent.

342
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,001
Then you can finally get a piece of ass.

343
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,900
I've had plenty.

344
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:24,579
Oh, is that why you look at
that picture of your mom so much?

345
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,010
Seriously, Frankie.

346
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,660
Is that the last pussy you've seen?

347
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,901
All right, come on, Frankie.
Let's see the photo. come on.

348
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,100
Bones tells me she's got
a great spread, Frankie.

349
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,420
Yo, he's gonna be crazy.

350
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,880
Oh, shit.

351
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,139
Come on! Come on!

352
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,380
Step up and see the beautiful...
and... hold up... sexy

353
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,240
Miss Forello!

354
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,340
What the fuck's going on?

355
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,100
Frankie.

356
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,579
Hey, no, come on, Frankie.

357
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,539
Come on, Frankie.

358
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,719
- Just give me the...
- No.

359
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,059
- J ust give me the photo.
- No, it looks good.

360
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,040
Just give it back.

361
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,499
It looks good.

362
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
- Just give it...
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

363
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,540
- Come on, Frankie.

364
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,019
- Okay. okay.
- Come on, Frankie.

365
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,199
- Okay.
- Come on, Frankie.

366
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,039
Just give me the photo, man.

367
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,560
- Frank, come on, man.
- That's my mom.

368
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,900
Just ask nice.

369
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,360
Please.

370
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,840
He said please!

371
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,019
Frankie, come on, man.

372
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,539
Frankie, come on.
Frankie, come on.

373
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,080
Oh, Frankie.

374
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,520
When you're the new guy, you just
shut up and do what they tell you.

375
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,000
They'd fuck with us constantly,
but...

376
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,659
It's just part of the game.

377
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,580
They... they want to see
who's gonna crack.

378
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,460
- Are you gonna crack?
- No, sir.

379
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,000
I got to last at least until
I prove them wrong.

380
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,940
Prove who wrong?

381
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,980
Everyone here and...

382
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,340
back home.

383
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,180
Come on, Frankie!
You can be the piggy in the middle!

384
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,320
- No, man.
- You can go in the middle, man.

385
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,940
Sir?

386
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,480
What is it?

387
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,479
Someone's approaching from
the west on foot.

388
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,480
- How far out?
- Less than a kick out, sir.

389
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,219
- All right, tell the twins.
- Already done, sir.

390
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,820
Good job. Assemble the men.

391
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,260
That's far enough.

392
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,580
Captain!

393
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,260
Lower your weapons.

394
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,820
Alderich Heilbronner, USDF
replacement soldier, sir.

395
00:27:01,418 --> 00:27:03,019
That was faster than it
should have been.

396
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,861
Duke got to the fob less
than eight hours ago.

397
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,700
Duke was stationed at mako as a
USDF liaison.

398
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,920
I volunteered.

399
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,581
Now, why would you do that?

400
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,580
Because i know what you face
out here, sir.

401
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,600
You cannot be a man down.

402
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,919
I respect what you're saying,
but i don't give a damn about D.F

403
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,740
You understand?

404
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,540
I'm a soldier. I will fight and
die by your side, Commander.

405
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,900
Welcome to 37.

406
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,160
It is an honor, sir.

407
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,280
The men seem like they'd follow
Spears into hell.

408
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,220
Would you?

409
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,960
You're damn right they would.

410
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,580
And i have.

411
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,160
And when the heavies first
invaded, they, uh...

412
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,800
dropped straight through the
atmosphere and landed hard.

413
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,640
A few days later, they launched
a worldwide attack.

414
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,840
It was every country for themselves.

415
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,540
It was complete fucking chaos.

416
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,799
Then things got better when the
u.n. was disbanded and the USDF form

417
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,440
The united space defense force.

418
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,740
Yeah!

419
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,380
Spears volunteered to lead a,
uh, counteroffensive and

420
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,740
brought me along for the ride.

421
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,280
After a couple of months, we, uh...

422
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,860
we started pushing them back.

423
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,300
They'd spread themselves too thin.

424
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,460
Well, that and our air force was
kicking the shit out of theirs.

425
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,219
We hit their mother ship so fucking hard

426
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,040
They couldn't wait to get the hell out.

427
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,680
And the world celebrated, but

428
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,700
There we still thousands of
heavies left behind.

429
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,480
Which brings us to the
creation of the outposts.

430
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,480
Exactly.

431
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,920
- Hey, Frankie.
- Evening, sir.

432
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,380
Busy tonight, huh?

433
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,640
Yeah.

434
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,760
Listen, i hear the boys have
been giving you a bit of a hard time.

435
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,360
It's just their way of
finding out who you are.

436
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,820
You're the new guy on the base.

437
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,780
They want to see what you can
take.

438
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,360
I promise you this...

439
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,840
If you can shoulder up to it

440
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,540
Show them you can take it

441
00:29:34,715 --> 00:29:35,955
Each and every one of these men

442
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,460
will have your back every day
of the week and twice on sundays.

443
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,700
Frankie, you got this!

444
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,980
It's all you, little man!

445
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,299
Let's go!

446
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,699
Go low!
Come on!

447
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,079
Go low!
Oh!

448
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,879
There it is!
Come on, Frankie!

449
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,639
Let's go, buddy.
Come on, Frankie.

450
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,400
We got money on you here.
Oh!

451
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,980
Yes.

452
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,840
Where are you from?

453
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,980
The New Republic of Biafra.

454
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,940
Why did you join the USDF?

455
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,960
I was an RNB resistance
fighter way before the invasion.

456
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,420
Seemed like another cause that
needed someone like me.

457
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,939
- Hey, Saleem.
- How's it going?

458
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,179
- Everyone's waiting for you.
- It's okay.

459
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,939
- How are you, my brother?
- Hey, North.

460
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,360
- So good to see you, my friend.
- Spears wants to see you.

461
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,160
There's been some strange
activity that's been happening.

462
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,560
Saleem's our Pakistani translator.

463
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,820
He's a... He's a good guy.

464
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,840
He loves us, man.
He loves Americans, you know?

465
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,480
Um, post invasion, the heavies,
uh, raided his village, killed his family.

466
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,780
They captured him, you know,
p.o.w.-like.

467
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,000
Then a group of American's came
through and saved him, you know?

468
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,020
Since then, he'd pretty much do
anything or us.

469
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,300
All right, men, listen up.

470
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:02,519
You're gonna follow Saleem back
down to... what's that place called?

471
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,320
Ghrem.

472
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,559
Yeah, Ghrem, to deal with the elders.

473
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,859
Some of the goats were killed last night.

474
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,300
They think it was one of our
mortars.

475
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:12,940
We can't afford to have a revolt,
not now, not after the recent attack.

476
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,940
North is gonna lead you down.

477
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,580
All right, let's go.
Stay alert.

478
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,160
Handle it.
Sir.

479
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,720
Sergeant Wilks?

480
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,099
Follow me, boys.

481
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,960
Have you ever seen a heavy in
person?

482
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,420
I've done the training, i've
been in the simulators, but no,

483
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,500
no face-to-face contact.

484
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,380
====

485
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,060
Why do you guys strap your
weapons down like that?

486
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,540
Oh, so the heavies and the
Hajis don't take them.

487
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,759
Why would a heavy want an M4?

488
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,980
I mean, they've got lasers.

489
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,620
Yeah, they got them.
They just can't use them.

490
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,700
Most of them are out of Ammo.

491
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,400
We'd be heavy slaves or worse if
they'd had enough during the war.

492
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,580
You go and speak to him.

493
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,560
Salaam.

494
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,440
He says we owe him 12 goats.
His wife and child have nothing.

495
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,640
- This was all that they had. - Well, you
tell him sorry, but we didn't do this.

496
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,260
Everyone, eyes up.
Omo, with me.

497
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,760
Copy, sir.

498
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,799
Fuck.

499
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,740
What is it?

500
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,980
No human did this.
Possible heavies in the area!

501
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,160
Contact, 12:00!

502
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,920
Hold your fire!
Saleem, tell him to stop.

503
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,299
Saleem, tell him to stop.

504
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,940
Hold your goddamn fire, Hans!

505
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,420
Everybody, spread out!
Tell him to stop!

506
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,280
This is his last warning,
Saleem!

507
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:37,140
He won't listen to me.
He doesn't look right, sir.

508
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,200
Oh, thank god.

509
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,380
God damn!
Shit!

510
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,600
Everybody, sound off!

511
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,699
Tentuglo, sir!
Team three good!

512
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,980
Saleem, you okay?

513
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,760
- Oh, shit!
- Heavies!

514
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,260
Take cover!
Go! go! go! go!

515
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,259
Move! Everybody up!
Let's go! Let's go!

516
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,380
Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!
Come on! Go!

517
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,379
Everybody, Reds now!

518
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,359
Reds in!
Come on! Light up the ridge!

519
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,460
We got another one at 3:00!

520
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,659
Now fall back!
Make our way back to the outpost.

521
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,400
Everybody, go!

522
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,759
Fall back! God damn it!

523
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,240
Fall back and regroup!

524
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,040
Move! Move! Move!

525
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,339
Move! Get out of here!
I got you, Frankie!

526
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,740
Got behind me.

527
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,599
Come on! Move! Move! Move!

528
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,099
Buddy, out of the way!

529
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,659
Okay, let's go! let's go!

530
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,520
Move! Move! Move!

531
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,100
Go! Go! Go!

532
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:04,459
People Forget, Or...
At least, They choose to forget

533
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,120
as a way to survive.

534
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,720
That's something that
I haven't been able to do.

535
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,720
I've never heard of heavies
planning an ambush before.

536
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,680
Me neither. Where is North?

537
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,240
Where is North? Lieutenant North!

538
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,399
Lieutenant North? We're going back.

539
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,919
Andros, come on. Omo, on me.

540
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,700
Let's go, boys. Move!

541
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,700
He pushed me away right here.

542
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,440
North?

543
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,060
North?

544
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,800
Let's go. Frankie, cover my 6:00.

545
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,760
God damn it, grant. Where are you?

546
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,240
Over here! Is that his helmet?

547
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,080
Oh, god.

548
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,020
=====

549
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,680
I'm headed to Mako.

550
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,320
General Dane needs to see this in person.

551
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,120
I'm leaving you with operational command.

552
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,819
- What are my orders, captain?
- Fortify the base.

553
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,380
Nobody leaves under any circumstances.
Understood?

554
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,920
Sir.

555
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,940
Fucking Germans, right?

556
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,900
I thought that brick said
that they were out of Ammo.

557
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,560
They don't have more

558
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,160
What's left

559
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,660
Which isn't much.

560
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,520
It doesn't take much.

561
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,660
Yeah, well, i don't know, man.

562
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,880
I mean, how we supposed to fight
that shit?

563
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,540
Well, Dude, that's what
we got Reds for, right?

564
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,700
It was low after they got North.

565
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,740
And then the PMCS came in, and

566
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,260
We fucking lost it.

567
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,580
Why did the PMCS show up?

568
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,840
Politics.

569
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,400
Who the fuck are you?

570
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:38,319
We're contractors sent by the
USDF to investigate last night's encounter.

571
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,119
What encounter?

572
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,020
Your orders are to stay at base.
Do not interfere.

573
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,100
Get off my base now.

574
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,100
You will comply or face court-martial.

575
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,280
We have jurisdiction here.

576
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,840
Take your men back inside.

577
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,900
Whose jurisdiction, dickhead?

578
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,960
Like i said... we do.

579
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,760
Mac, get on the horn with Mako, find out
what the fuck is going on here.

580
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,000
Copy that, sir.

581
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,000
Uh, sir, our orders are to stand down.

582
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,800
I don't know why the fuck
they brought them in.

583
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,420
Oh, where the fuck is spears?

584
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,319
I don't know.

585
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,020
Haven't been able to raise him
on the comms all day.

586
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,180
We can't even search for North Proper.

587
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,940
What if we use the drone?

588
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:57,170
Oh, you're a goddamn genius.

589
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,920
Yo, it's too dark, Mac.

590
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:10,710
I thought all you brothers liked the dark.
Eyes and teeth, right?

591
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,800
Yo, cut it, Harty.

592
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:19,270
Hang on.
Is that the pmcs?

593
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:22,320
What are those fuckers doing past the ncz?

594
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,280
Where the fuck are they?

595
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,110
Now i got to head back, man.
My battery's dying.

596
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,490
Y'all tell Andros to go play catch.

597
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:35,470
Andros, we got the u.a.v.
Headed back in your direction.

598
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,040
Oh, shit. A heavy.

599
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:41,800
Wait. Who's that?
It's saleem.

600
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,440
We got a heavy chasing saleem!

601
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,340
Hans, support! Brick, on omo!

602
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:52,670
Frankie, stay here! Let's go! Let's
move it! Let's go! Come on! Let's go!

603
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:56,450
I'm arming the drone.
Hurry up. It's almost on him.

604
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:00,330
Come on! Close it up!
Everybody in!

605
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:04,950
What's your status, Mac?
I can't get it. The target won't lock.

606
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,260
I'm going up!

607
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,080
I can't get the shot!

608
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,710
Mac, i can't get the shot.
Come on, motherfucker, lock!

609
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,030
Mac!
Come on!

610
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,090
What the fucking shit?

611
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,330
Strap it up.

612
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,030
I had never been more scared
in my entire life

613
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,420
When we brought that
thing back to the base.

614
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,940
Think it knows where North is?

615
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,890
Bet your ass it does.
Can't we wake it up

616
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:09,180
And make it tell us?
No.

617
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,580
What the fuck are you doing?

618
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:21,100
I told you not to go off this base!
Sir.

619
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,260
This is my responsibility

620
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:28,760
It was chasing saleem, and we
had to go after him.

621
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,010
All right, everyone out.
Omo and Wilks, stay here.

622
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,010
All right, what's going on?

623
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,580
Captain, we thought we could
extract North...

624
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,080
Your job, sergeant, is not to think!

625
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:45,720
Your job is to obey orders!
Do you understand that?!

626
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:48,490
Yes, sir, but shouldn't we at
least try to... try to what?!

627
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,780
Sir, what do we do?

628
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,640
We do nothing.

629
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:10,990
Captain, North may be in the hands of...
i said we do nothing

630
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:15,710
because those are our orders.
We don't know if North is dead or alive.

631
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:20,090
And i won't compromise this base,
this mission, or my men for anyone.

632
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,280
This operation is bigger than
any one of us, myself included.

633
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:28,270
And when i tell you to obey an order,
you obey that goddamn order.

634
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,280
Do you understand, sergeant?!

635
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,240
- Yes, sir.
- Dismissed.

636
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,650
Sir.

637
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,380
- You sure you want to do this?
- I am sure.

638
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:48,350
- You know we can't support you.
- I know.

639
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,080
If you find North, come straight back.
Don't try and rescue him.

640
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,540
Just get the coordinates
and bring them back.

641
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,410
Today i'm alive because of you.

642
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,730
Insha'allah, i may repay that debt.

643
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:11,020
Why did you join the usdf?

644
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:17,280
My dad gave my brother and i
two options... military or law.

645
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:20,980
My twin took the better option.

646
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:35,510
I'm gonna go out on a limb
here and assume

647
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:38,750
That you guys aren't really twins.

648
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,810
Your turn, man.

649
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,100
All right.

650
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:48,070
We both enlisted at chapsworth
the same year,

651
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,960
and we both have the same last...
it's a military academy.

652
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,630
Right.

653
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,690
And we both have the same
last name... dotson.

654
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:02,340
Anyway, we came up through the cal
program together. Cal's a sniper program.

655
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,580
Man, you always leave this shit out like
people know what you're talking about.

656
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,910
Whatever. Look,
we was both trained in prewar.

657
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,310
The academy is in south carolina.

658
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,410
An impact zone.
Luckily, it wasn't leveled when they hit.

659
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:21,290
Didn't take long before we spot
them on the ground.

660
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:22,600
Heavies?

661
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,150
Oh, yeah.

662
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,920
He and i were up in the watchtowers.

663
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,290
Held them off long enough for
the army to come in and provide support.

664
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:32,160
I got another goat here.

665
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:39,120
So, yeah, twin guard towers,
twin snipers, same last name.

666
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:41,620
The twins.

667
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,410
I'm gonna take this shot.

668
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:48,230
Harty's cooking is slightly less
horrible when there's meat involved.

669
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:59,920
Yo, come on, man.
What, you got somewhere to be?

670
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,460
Man, why you always scared of everything?

671
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,370
- I'm not scared.
- Man, you is scared.

672
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,775
You scared of boo. You
scared that there

673
00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:12,285
hasn't been any contact
in the past few days.

674
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:15,950
- You is scared.
- It's strange.

675
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,360
I'm not scared.

676
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,240
Just strange.
He's definitely scared.

677
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,110
Hey, what you got there?

678
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:27,140
It's bourbon.

679
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,160
That's my swo milk, man.

680
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,350
- What is swo milk?
- It's a protein shake, fool.

681
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:39,190
Damn. German bourbon better than homo milk.

682
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,360
Get out of here with your kraut bigot ass.

683
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:44,600
Got more protein between my balls
than your fucking shake.

684
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,700
He caught you right...
That ain't funny, hans!

685
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,470
Where were you during the f.e.w.?

686
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,950
I was in munich. Berlin was hit.

687
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:59,080
My father and i traveled as quickly as
we could to aide with the resistance.

688
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:01,430
Do you think the heavies will
attempt another invasion?

689
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:04,740
Yeah, my father and i both
believe they will.

690
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,060
He regrets he can no longer
stand to meet the invaders.

691
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,010
But that is why he sent me out.

692
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:17,080
Yo, fingers?

693
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:20,600
Frankie?

694
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,460
- Fingers!
- What the hell?

695
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:29,080
It's your shift, man.

696
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,470
Oh, shit, it's saleem.

697
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:59,400
Got saleem approaching gate.

698
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,070
Hey, bones, you see him?

699
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:06,060
Yeah, he's about a minute out.

700
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,730
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

701
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,470
Thanks.

702
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,760
- Ah, it's good.
- Yeah, it is.

703
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:26,730
For those of you who'd like
to hear what saleem found,

704
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:28,300
He'll be here in two minutes.

705
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:31,070
Mac to Frankie.
Why ain't you at the terminal, man?

706
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,300
Just came to let the guys
know that saleem was here.

707
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:34,630
You want me to come back?

708
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,590
Not now. Igot it.

709
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,170
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

710
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,930
Here we go.

711
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:45,560
All right.

712
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,160
New orders, saleem... got to
search everybody.

713
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:51,310
Yo, Frankie, step back.
Hands up.

714
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,810
Hey, arms to your sides, saleem.
Come on.

715
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,210
What the fuck?

716
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:14,110
- All right. all clear.
- Frankie, something's off.

717
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:15,159
Hey, man, what'd you find?

718
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,670
Yo, Frankie, something's off. You read me?

719
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,360
- Saleem, where are you going,
- Frankie, you copy?

720
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:21,650
Shit!

721
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,860
Frankie!

722
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,330
No! Frankie!

723
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:39,440
Oh, fuck. No. No.

724
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:41,730
Shit. Andros.

725
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:52,630
Fuck! Frankie! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

726
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,550
What the fuck is going on?

727
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,590
What is that?

728
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:39,610
I still can't make sense of it.

729
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:41,750
I.. just...

730
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,350
I don't know.
Here's a guy

731
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:55,580
Who's been... risking his life for
the past year, helping us.

732
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:01,430
You think he was working
against you this whole time?

733
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,850
He had a lot of other chances.

734
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,940
A lot of them would've
done way more damage.

735
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,800
I just... I don't know.

736
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:21,420
What do you think, brick?

737
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,780
Don't even matter what i think.

738
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,600
Would you say that you and
saleem were good friends?

739
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:30,970
Saleem?

740
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:34,910
Yeah, i'd say so.

741
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,920
Is that why you took it upon
yourself to bury him?

742
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,140
No.

743
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,250
Why did you do it then?

744
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,400
Hq. said we had to keep
his death classified.

745
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,760
But he still deserved a proper burial.

746
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:52,840
How did you know how to give
him an islamic burial?

747
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,360
Know your enemy.

748
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,750
If you believe in god,
now's the time to pray.

749
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:10,430
And if you don't...

750
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,220
Let's all just take a moment...

751
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:15,870
Remember Frankie.

752
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,820
I want everyone to take a couple
of minutes, get your heads

753
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:34,550
Then back to it.

754
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,720
How did you feel when Frankie died?

755
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:28,010
Uh, he... he was a good kid.
You know?

756
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,400
But, actually, um, can we take
it back a couple of questions?

757
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,990
Sure. Which one?

758
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:43,600
When my tour's done...

759
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:47,750
I'm gonna track down his mom...

760
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:50,790
Give her a hug...

761
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,360
Let her know that Frankie was a good kid.

762
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,150
She should be proud of him.

763
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,720
Then i'm gonna track down his father.

764
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,340
I'm gonna look him in the face,

765
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,750
And i'm gonna say, "Frankie's more
of a man than you will ever be.

766
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,200
What's all that?

767
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,680
This is everything saleem had
in his possession when he died.

768
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,170
Can you all keep it down, please?

769
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:22,490
You think it'll help explain what happened?

770
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,200
Can't hurt.

771
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:34,000
Goddamn, that's a ugly
motherfucker right there.

772
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,870
Oh, shit. it's that kid.

773
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:45,690
Yo, can you translate shit like that?

774
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,580
Ain't these missing people
from saleem's village?

775
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:56,750
Where they all going?

776
00:53:57,790 --> 00:53:59,280
What do you think it means?

777
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:02,220
Sorry, i don't have time for
the camera right now.

778
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,950
Mistakes were made last night.

779
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,160
And we paid dearly for it.

780
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:12,480
Our enemies don't care for the
ones you've lost.

781
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:15,320
They don't care for the ones you love.

782
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:19,080
Their objective is the
annihilation of humanity.

783
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:22,270
Omohundro...

784
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,420
Why'd you sign up for the usdf?

785
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:32,130
To fight for my country,
for my planet, sir.

786
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,740
Were you willing to risk
everything when you did?

787
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,490
Yes, sir.

788
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,600
- What about your life, son?
- Absolutely, sir.

789
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,200
Exactly.

790
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:46,520
Exactly!

791
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:49,680
It's time for us to take this
fight to them!

792
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:54,840
It's time that each and every
one of them must pay!

793
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:57,960
And today we make those bastards pay.

794
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,560
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

795
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,350
- I said, do you got it?!
- Sir, yes, sir!

796
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:20,660
All right, everybody, listen up!
Swap out your ammo for reds! let's go!

797
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,950
- Anything?
- Negative, sir.

798
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:44,330
What do you want do, captain?

799
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,360
Geisterstadt.

800
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,330
Let's go.

801
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:56,030
- Bravo, is that you?
- Ziege.

802
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,650
Hans, English!

803
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,450
He said "goat." Ain't nothing here but a
motherfucking goat.

804
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,640
Any sign of North?
No, he's not here, man.

805
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:06,790
- There's no one here.
- Find saleem's house yet?

806
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:10,460
- Not yet, man. - How we supposed to
even tell which one is his, anyway?

807
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,830
Copy that.

808
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:18,540
Scratch that. We found it.

809
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:34,680
God damn it, we've got shots fired!
I repeat, shots fired. alpha, is that you?

810
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,250
- Negative, captain.
- All right, stay where you are.

811
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:39,410
Let's go! Move! Move! Move!

812
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:42,720
Mac, put that fucking thermal
down and grab your weapon.

813
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:46,580
Hans, omo, with me.
Go. Go. Go. Go.

814
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,580
Get your binocs out, scope out those trees.

815
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,140
We got movement at 11:00.

816
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:57,800
Stay alert.

817
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:03,020
Shit, it's North.
We got North.

818
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:05,200
Wilks, we need you out here now.

819
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,610
Copy that. I'm on my way.

820
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:17,750
Guys, coming up on your left!

821
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:23,290
Where the fuck is everyone going?

822
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:33,440
Is his temp low?

823
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:35,940
He's good.

824
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,570
98.6

825
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,940
North had been shot three times

826
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,470
But he was strong, stable,

827
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:51,860
Which was a relief at the time.

828
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:56,869
I mean, there's a million things
you wish you could've done

829
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:58,590
Differently when you look back.

830
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:00,440
But that's the catch.

831
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:05,350
You can't look back when you're in it.

832
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:08,630
All you can do is move forward

833
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,050
March or die.

834
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,900
He's been out since the ride home.

835
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:26,420
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Yeah. he's an ox.

836
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,590
Come here.

837
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,860
Ah that's where he got shot...
One here

838
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,410
One here, and over here.

839
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:41,060
He's lucky he's dehydrated.

840
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,890
Vitals are surprisingly okay,

841
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:51,960
But... i just want be sure before
i move him, you know?

842
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,190
Check out his eyes. R.e.m. sleep.

843
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,440
So...? It's repeating,

844
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,310
i think he's trying to tell us something.

845
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:14,920
I'm getting a problem with the thermals
here. Looks like a blob or something.

846
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,430
Just restart. I'm sure it'll fix it.

847
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,490
Copy that.

848
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,390
What you got there?
I'll let you know once i figure it out.

849
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,860
All right. Or i could just tell you.

850
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,860
What is it?
It's tap code.

851
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:42,580
No, man, can't be tap code.
There's a 9 and a 6 in there.

852
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,510
Do you mind?

853
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,670
Lete's see here...

854
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:59,360
l-a-t.

855
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:03,460
L-o-n. Oh, shit.

856
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,480
Show him, Mac.

857
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,840
Okay, that's 3. That's 3.

858
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:17,740
That's 6. That's 5.

859
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:21,590
There's gonna be a quick pause.
And then it's gonna start again, sir.

860
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,630
North.

861
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:29,320
We understand you're giving us coordinates.
If you can hear me

862
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:31,720
just give me a sign.

863
01:01:34,365 --> 01:01:36,925
Wilks, he's in there. Do you have
something that can wake him up?

864
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:40,680
Nothing, his vitals are normal.
It's more like a state of paralysis.

865
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:41,910
Grant...

866
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:46,280
Listen to me.
What's at those coordinates?

867
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,250
You got it? What is it?

868
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,270
It says "steel rain," sir.

869
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:13,850
Kill me! Kill me!

870
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:46,590
This ain't a error, Mac.
There's something out there.

871
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:49,420
Okay, hold on.

872
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,810
What are humans doing with heavies?

873
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:02,020
All units, man defensive positions. Contact
imminent. I repeat, contact imminent.

874
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,390
- Put general dane on the line right now.
- One moment.

875
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:08,750
Dane here. Go ahead, captain.

876
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,362
General, we have hundreds
of insurgents and

877
01:03:10,388 --> 01:03:12,108
an unknown number of
heavies two klicks out.

878
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:12,820
Together?

879
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:13,700
Yes, sir.

880
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,661
We've got action all over the map.

881
01:03:15,914 --> 01:03:18,115
It's gonna be an hour before
we can provide air support.

882
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,700
Sir, we are not staying here.

883
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,660
What are you talking about, captain?

884
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,750
General, North was k.i.a.,
but he communicated

885
01:03:23,776 --> 01:03:26,085
something before we lost him...
a set of coordinates.

886
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,820
Steel rain, sir.

887
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,100
Give me those coordinates.

888
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,100
Break contact. Fall back to mako.

889
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:36,740
Copy that, sir. Spears out.

890
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:40,980
Sir, what's steel rain?

891
01:03:44,755 --> 01:03:47,315
I want you to assemble all
the men at the snake's nest right now.

892
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,060
The enemy's gonna be here in minutes.

893
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:54,660
Fuck. I knew it.

894
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,261
And why is their temperatures low, man?

895
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,700
Yo, Mac, why's their
temperatures so low, man?

896
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:01,820
Dotson, Dotson, get back in the nest.

897
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:02,620
Keep an eye on that hill.

898
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:03,260
Yes, sir.

899
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:06,980
Mac, Brick, prep the ghoul with every
case of ammo we got for immediate evac.

900
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:08,740
Bones, i want you on the mortar.

901
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:12,180
Omohundro, Nakamura, and Harty,
you're on the North wall.

902
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:13,500
Hans, you're on the east wall.

903
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:17,980
Andros, i want you to rig this
entire fucking outpost to blow.

904
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:18,860
Understood?

905
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:19,780
Yes, sir.

906
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,460
Let's buy Andros some time.

907
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:24,420
We're gonna light this place up, boys.

908
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,860
Wilks, i want you out here right now.

909
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:30,980
Be right there, captain.

910
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:40,380
What the fuck?

911
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:59,780
Brick, i want daylight.
North ridge. Hit it now.

912
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:03,980
Open up! Go!

913
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:07,660
Heavies, 200 yards!

914
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:08,820
Go! Go!

915
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:10,220
All fire on that laser!

916
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:11,060
Go!

917
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,340
More heavies, North ridge!

918
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:23,180
Come on! Hurry up! Hurry up!

919
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:33,900
Oh, fuck, there's a lot of them!
You got a heavy, 11:00!

920
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:35,540
Move! Move! Move!

921
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:40,579
You got him!

922
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:44,700
Move it! We got another heavy over there!
Rpg coming in!

923
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:49,100
You guys all right?

924
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,540
Captain, there's too many!

925
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:57,500
We got to move!
Hold your positions!

926
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:02,100
Andros, what's your eta?!
Hurry up, son!

927
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:03,872
Need more time!

928
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,420
Come on! Fire it up!

929
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:12,140
Scheisse!

930
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:16,180
Fire straight up the wall!
Heavy laser charging up!

931
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,540
Incoming!

932
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:21,700
Omo!

933
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,300
They've breached the wall!
Let's go! Let's go!

934
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:26,580
Come on!

935
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,860
You good?
Then grab your weapon!

936
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:31,980
Get back on that wall!
Zilla, on your back!

937
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:35,569
You solid?
Damn it, andros, we're out of time!

938
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:37,020
Two more to go, sir!

939
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:41,220
Brick, you all right?

940
01:06:42,452 --> 01:06:43,340
They're making a push!

941
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:44,740
There's too fucking many!

942
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,820
There's too many!

943
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:57,500
The outpost is hot!

944
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:01,780
Everybody... now!

945
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:05,540
Zilla, i need reds!

946
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:09,060
Coming in with reds!

947
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:14,568
Zilla, are you all right?!

948
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:18,154
Everybody, fall back to ghoul!

949
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:22,020
Go! Go! Go! Go!

950
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:24,420
Go! Let's go! Move!

951
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:30,700
Fucking move!
Move! Move!

952
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:42,620
All right, let's go! Clear out!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

953
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:45,100
Everybody, load up! Load up!
Everybody in!

954
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:47,740
Go, captain! Go!

955
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:49,059
God damn it, Wilks, where you going?

956
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,700
Got to move!
Load up! I'll be right there!

957
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:52,580
Go! Go! Go! Get in! Get in!

958
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:53,980
Let's go! Let's go! Move it!

959
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:57,540
Load up! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

960
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:05,500
Come on! Go!

961
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:13,660
Sir, can i blow it?!
Affirmative! Now!

962
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:34,780
Latch them goddamned doors!

963
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:45,260
Brick!

964
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,580
Brick! Goddamn fucking harness.

965
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,300
- No! No! No!
- What?!

966
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,790
I got him. I got him.

967
01:08:52,791 --> 01:08:55,620
Don't touch him! don't touch him!
No!

968
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:58,580
Move! Go! Go! Go! Brick!

969
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:00,940
No! No!

970
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:07,100
No! No!

971
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:09,380
- Get... oh!
- No!

972
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:19,734
The moment that we lost brick was
probably the lowest point in my career

973
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,700
Maybe my life.

974
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:32,540
You know, there's those guys
that you know just can't die.

975
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:36,420
You know, you're sure of it, and, um...

976
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:42,780
and brick was one of those guys.

977
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:53,700
And every time you lose someone,
you... you tell yourself, "okay,

978
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:57,688
that's it. That's... that's the last one
that they're gonna take."

979
01:09:57,689 --> 01:10:01,700
And was he the last one?

980
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:11,780
- General, it's spears.
- Spears, what are you doing?

981
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:13,140
I'm doing what needs to be done.

982
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:14,371
Get back here asap.

983
01:10:14,372 --> 01:10:18,940
- North provided this intel for a reason.
- Pfcs say nothing's out there.

984
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:21,940
General, there was something
embedded in his brain.

985
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:25,380
I think the heavies are using it
for some kind of mind control.

986
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:27,140
You have your orders. Follow them.

987
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:28,180
Look, sir, you...

988
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:36,100
What i'm about to ask you to do

989
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:37,980
is in violation of a direct order.

990
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:42,859
I do not expect any one of you
to burn for my decision,

991
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:48,260
but i do believe that there is a real
and imminent threat down there.

992
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:53,900
We're all soldiers, and we all
signed up for the same reason...

993
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:58,454
to protect our families, to protect
our friends, and to protect this planet.

994
01:10:58,455 --> 01:11:01,620
And those bastards are here
to take that away from us.

995
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:08,020
They are here to eliminate everything
that we are and everything that we love.

996
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:10,218
If your conscience is
telling you to walk

997
01:11:10,244 --> 01:11:12,012
away, then i want you
to walk away right now.

998
01:11:12,013 --> 01:11:15,432
But if you do leave here, you leave
here with your head held high

999
01:11:15,433 --> 01:11:18,978
Because each and every one
of you have earned that right.

1000
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:23,020
And i will always respect you for that.

1001
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:34,828
Sir, we're coming up on the coordinates.

1002
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:36,340
Ain't nobody here.

1003
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:39,916
I'm going up

1004
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:44,629
There's something up on the right.

1005
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:50,020
What the fuck?

1006
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:51,900
Omo, get your ass down here now!

1007
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:53,020
Contact!

1008
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:58,860
Zilla, get us out of here now!

1009
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,820
Come on, Zilla!
It won't start!

1010
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,100
All right, listen up!
Bravo team, with me!

1011
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:06,900
Alpha team, get this vehicle operational!

1012
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:08,300
Let's move! Let's move!

1013
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,660
Bravo, we got a heavy at 1:00!

1014
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,660
- We got a heavy at 11:00!
- Move!

1015
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:16,940
We got to recon and find out
what that thing is!

1016
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:20,540
Right there!

1017
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:22,180
I got another heavy up on the ridge!

1018
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:26,300
Move over, the other side of the ditch!

1019
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:27,380
Frag out!

1020
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:29,700
Move! Move! Let's go!

1021
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:31,180
- We're right behind you, sir!
- Covering fire!

1022
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,900
- Move!
- Bravo!

1023
01:12:34,409 --> 01:12:36,889
Mac, get under the hood, see if
you can get her up and running.

1024
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:37,390
Yes, sir.

1025
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:38,433
Let's go.

1026
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:41,019
- Let's go. Lefty, Righty, hold positions.
- Yes, sir!

1027
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,460
Bones, stay on that 50!

1028
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,620
Hans, you're with me.

1029
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:46,860
- Covering!
- Hold up. Hold up.

1030
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:48,700
- Covering fire!
- Everybody ready?

1031
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:50,900
- Covering!
- Covering fire!

1032
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:53,820
- Covering fire!
- Keep going! Stay on that ridge!

1033
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:03,332
Move! Everybody, take cover!

1034
01:13:03,333 --> 01:13:06,380
I got him!

1035
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:16,580
- Entrance... your 2:00.
- Copy that!

1036
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,431
Heads up! Get ready to move!

1037
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:20,860
Move in!

1038
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:22,140
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1039
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:25,060
We got a bird in the sky!

1040
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:30,260
This is sergeants Wilks of o.p. 37.

1041
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:32,500
My men are pinned down in the valley below.

1042
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:35,180
Requesting air support. Will you comply?

1043
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,744
Roger that, sergeant.
Dane thought you guys might need some help.

1044
01:13:40,745 --> 01:13:41,620
Copy that.

1045
01:13:45,114 --> 01:13:46,195
That's right, motherfucker!

1046
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:47,541
All right, i move and you follow.

1047
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:48,380
Copy that.

1048
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,969
Move! Move! Move!

1049
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:00,700
Eyes up! Eyes up, captain!

1050
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:04,519
Move! Move! Move!

1051
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:09,540
They're trying to keep you away from
the entrance! We'll provide cover!

1052
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:16,140
Son of a... Andros, give me a door!

1053
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:27,900
Go!

1054
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:33,180
Here we go!

1055
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:38,928
Move! Let's move!

1056
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,780
Moving!

1057
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:48,700
Wilks, keep that door clear
so we have a way out!

1058
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:50,300
Copy that, sir. Good luck!

1059
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,300
What the hell is this place?

1060
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:08,124
Now listen up.

1061
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:13,296
We find whatever it is that's
holding this place up.

1062
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:15,860
Andros, you're gonna blow it to hell.

1063
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:18,100
Copy that.

1064
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:22,700
Harty, omo... go.

1065
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:27,018
Okay, let's go.

1066
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,580
Captain, you need to come look at this.

1067
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,100
Oh, fuck!

1068
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:52,580
It's the missing locals.
And the pmc soldiers.

1069
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:12,500
Ah! They're waking up!

1070
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:14,660
We got to go! We got to go!

1071
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:17,620
Come on, move!
Get the hell out of here!

1072
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:20,220
Andros! Grenade in, go!

1073
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,780
Fall back! They're in the hall!
Take cover!

1074
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:27,140
Cover!

1075
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:39,380
Red flag out!

1076
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:41,592
Last red flag!

1077
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:45,820
Let's go, boys!

1078
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:46,597
Come on!

1079
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:52,580
One more up ahead!

1080
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:53,646
Grenade!

1081
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:57,180
They're down!

1082
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,110
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1083
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:01,860
Clear?

1084
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:04,980
- Clear!
- Sir, over here.

1085
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:06,820
There's another one of those rooms.

1086
01:17:22,475 --> 01:17:24,155
You guys need to get the hell
out of there!

1087
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:25,511
This thing is powering up!

1088
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:28,819
Andros, rig that piece of shit to blow!
Let's go!

1089
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:31,180
Everyone, set a perimeter!
Move! Move! Move!

1090
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:37,420
Talon 8, you need to move out!
You're in immediate danger!

1091
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:41,027
Roger that, sergeant.
One more strike, and off the mike

1092
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:44,100
Oh, shit.

1093
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,420
Watch it, Mac! I gotta reload!

1094
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:47,820
Motherfucker!

1095
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:51,740
Andros, let me know when
we're rigged and ready to go!

1096
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:53,500
- Yes, sir!
- They're coming this way!

1097
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:00,380
Andros, we got to move, son!
Let's go!

1098
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:07,220
God damn it, give me some cover!

1099
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:11,460
Set!

1100
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:15,140
Get over there!

1101
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:16,660
Fuck!
Give him some cover!

1102
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,140
What the fuck is that?!

1103
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:33,100
Mayday, mayday, this is talon 8!

1104
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:34,740
We have got multiple system failures!

1105
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:38,100
Fuck!

1106
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:41,540
Mac, we're heading back to you!

1107
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:45,620
Falling back!
Ready? Cover!

1108
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:49,140
Copy that!
Come on!

1109
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:51,620
Move! move!
Back to the vehicle!

1110
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:52,807
Move! Move!

1111
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:57,260
I got you! Move! Come on!

1112
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:59,180
Let's go! Let's go!

1113
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:04,402
Andros, you all right?

1114
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:08,540
The wireless transmitter's been hit. Grab
the wire, trigger, and knife from my bag.

1115
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:11,020
We got a heavy coming!

1116
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:14,420
Motherfucker!

1117
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:18,220
All right, now! Here we go!

1118
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:20,260
It won't catch!

1119
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,420
The ground receiver... cut that into it.

1120
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:33,460
Now give it to me and get the fuck out
of here! Bullshit. With one hand.

1121
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,540
Click, click, click, boom, right?

1122
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:37,100
Yeah.

1123
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:38,821
All right, you guys get him out of here!

1124
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:41,700
On set!
Harty, take andros!

1125
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:44,860
Omo, provide covering fire!
Move!

1126
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:47,740
- Covering fire!
- Heavy!

1127
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:52,533
Zilla!

1128
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,900
Give it a try again.

1129
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:03,500
Heavy!

1130
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:10,700
Captain!

1131
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:23,220
Lefty!

1132
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,860
What the fuck?
Get hans! Get him in that vehicle!

1133
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:27,700
Turn it around!
Hans, are you good?

1134
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:29,020
Yeah, i'm good.
Come on.

1135
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:30,619
You're gonna need a new leg,
but you'll make it.

1136
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:31,500
Coverage!

1137
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,260
Now!

1138
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:39,780
Get him out of here now!

1139
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,940
Let's go! Move!

1140
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:45,252
Andros, go!

1141
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,060
Mac, get them on the horn!

1142
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:49,301
We need to get the fuck out of
here while we still can!

1143
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:50,980
Yes, sir. copy that.
Here we go.

1144
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:55,300
Omo, i'll do it.

1145
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:10,100
I won't make it.
Let me do it.

1146
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:14,780
I got this.
You get them out of here.

1147
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:18,300
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Let's go!

1148
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:19,300
Clear out!

1149
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,780
Omo, load up!

1150
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:27,380
Let's go!

1151
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:30,180
One...

1152
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:32,940
Stay with him.

1153
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:34,741
Come on, boys!
Where's the rest of them?

1154
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:36,900
They didn't make it!
Go! Go! Go!

1155
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,940
- Yes, sir!
- Wilks, get in!

1156
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:40,980
Two...

1157
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:45,820
three!

1158
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:50,340
Fuck!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1159
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,420
- Help!
- Stop!

1160
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:07,780
Why aren't they shooting at us?

1161
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:10,900
Please stop!
Something's wrong with them.

1162
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:12,420
Help us! Please!

1163
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:14,140
Help us!

1164
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:23,100
Why do you think the heavies
invaded earth?

1165
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:25,220
I don't know.

1166
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:29,439
I don't think anybody has
the answer to that.

1167
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,500
I don't know why they came.

1168
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:36,460
I do know that tens of millions
died because of them.

1169
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:39,783
And i'm doing everything that...

1170
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:44,060
We're doing everything that we can to
make sure that they never come back.

1171
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:09,540
Fuck! What is it?
Omo! Omo!

1172
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:10,620
Stay here.

1173
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:30,500
We lost a lot of good men.
But the price was worth it.

1174
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:36,060
It was worth it.

1175
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:37,985
Whoo!

1176
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:42,740
At least, that's what i tell myself.

1177
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:46,035
I still see the guys we lost every day.

1178
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:48,780
Take care.

1179
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:49,538
See you.

1180
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:54,001
I worry, you know, not... not, uh...

1181
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:59,180
Not for myself, but that their
sacrifice will go unnoticed...

1182
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:06,060
These men, men who gave their lives
for people who didn't even believe in them.

1183
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,900
So, what did "steel rain" mean?

1184
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:21,020
The second wave.

1185
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:53,500
See you on the ground!
