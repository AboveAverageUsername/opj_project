{98947}{98975}You don`t like it?
{98977}{99007}No? l don`t like it.
{99038}{99101}Maybe we should call Don Johnson|and tell him to find his apartment?
{99121}{99160}l don`t know what you and|your band were thinking.
{99163}{99220}But l want it back the way it was. Now? Now?
{99228}{99269}Okay, Mitch. Just relax.
{99283}{99330}Because we didn`t touch the pottery room .

{99526}{99562}Okay, you know what, Trey? Just stop.
{99565}{99585}You got a lot of nerve, ladies.
{99589}{99644}You just can`t come in here and change|the whole place without my permission.
{99648}{99676}You don`t have the right to do this.
{99681}{99730}And what is this? This dog? Get this dog out of here.

{99799}{99819}Mine?
{99822}{99861}l don`t want some dog. What is this?
{99873}{99901}He`s not just any dog.
{99909}{99947}He used to be a drug-sniffer in the K-9 unit.
{99957}{99985}He looks like a drug addict.
{99989}{100040}Mitch, we want him to make you|look more sympathetic.
{100049}{100116}Hey, an entire K-9 isn`t|going to make him look sympathetic.
{100123}{100147}You want me to look sympathetic?
{100151}{100202}Get all the shit out here and get all my stuff back.
{100209}{100274}Then l`ll be real sympathetic, until then,|l`m not going to be sympathetic.
{100318}{100369}How can you say no to that face, Mitch?
{100435}{100463}l can say no very easy.
{100466}{100496}No, Powder. Get out?
{100499}{100550}Hey, what`s the matter with you?|Don`t be like that to the dog.

{100598}{100635}Hey, come here, pal . You are a good boy, aren`t you?
{100760}{100817}Hey, maybe Mitch is right.|Maybe you should get rid of the dog.
{100824}{100877}Well , l don`t know. l like his instinct.
{100903}{100937}Watch your ass, Powder.
{101500}{101541}Okay. Move it?

{110711}{110750}We are screwed.
{110795}{110834}Just got back on our tape, top cop.
{110966}{111033}Being a police office isn`t what the S EAL`s doing.
{111042}{111081}You have been a cop for 28 years.
{111086}{111125}l never see you do anything like this.
{111139}{111194}You put the entire city at risk.

{111720}{111771}Listen, if Marcus gets more of those|guns on the street,
{111775}{111826}we`ll be far more worse than what we are now.
{111829}{111862}You ruined it, Mitch.
{111868}{111907}Now, l`m relieving you from your duty
{111911}{111954}pending on a full investigation.
