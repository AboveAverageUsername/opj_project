2
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:10,305
I have found almost everything
ever written about love...

3
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:11,806
... to be true.

4
00:01:12,011 --> 00:01:16,038
Shakespeare said,
"Journeys end in lovers meeting."

5
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:18,045
What an extraordinary thought.

6
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,686
Personally, I have not experienced
anything remotely close to that...

7
00:01:21,887 --> 00:01:24,947
... but I'm more than willing to believe
Shakespeare had.

8
00:01:25,157 --> 00:01:28,490
I suppose I think about love
more than anyone really should.

9
00:01:28,694 --> 00:01:34,132
I'm constantly amazed by its sheer
power to alter and define our lives.

10
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,301
It was Shakespeare who also said,
"Love is blind."

11
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:42,607
Now, that is something
I know to be true.

12
00:01:54,453 --> 00:01:58,048
For some, quite inexplicably...

13
00:01:58,824 --> 00:02:00,382
... love fades.

14
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:16,640
For others...

15
00:02:16,842 --> 00:02:18,935
... love is simply lost.

16
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:28,881
But then, of course,
love can also be found.

17
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:32,215
Even if just for the night.

18
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:39,390
And then there'
another kind of love.

19
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:41,031
The cruelest kind.

20
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,963
The one that almost kills its victims.

21
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,003
It' called unrequited love.

22
00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:51,302
Of that, I am an expert.

23
00:02:51,844 --> 00:02:55,644
Most love stories are about people
who fall in love with each other.

24
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:59,181
But what about the rest of us?
What about our stories?

25
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:01,785
Those of us who fall in love alone.

26
00:03:02,388 --> 00:03:05,050
We are the victims
of the one-sided affair.

27
00:03:05,257 --> 00:03:07,122
We are the cursed
of the loved ones.

28
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:10,090
We are the unloved ones.
The walking wounded.

29
00:03:10,296 --> 00:03:13,754
The handicapped without the
advantage of a great parking space.

30
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:16,433
Yes, you are looking at one
such individual.

31
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:18,660
And I have willingly loved...

32
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:22,671
... that man for over
three miserable years.

33
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,173
The absolute worst years of my life.

34
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:27,504
The worst Christmases,
the worst birthdays.

35
00:03:27,713 --> 00:03:31,376
New Year' Eves brought in
by tears and Valium.

36
00:03:31,584 --> 00:03:35,577
These years I've been in love have
been the darkest days of my life...

37
00:03:35,788 --> 00:03:38,985
... all because I'm cursed by being
in love with a man who does not...

38
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:41,523
... and will not love me back.

39
00:03:41,727 --> 00:03:43,285
Oh, God, just the sight of him.

40
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:46,987
Heart pounding, throat thickening,
absolutely can't swallow.

41
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,861
All the usual symptoms.

42
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:51,798
Oh, Jasper.

43
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:56,464
- Don't tell me you're still...
- No, no, no, that's over. Very over.

44
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:59,940
What's the story with you two anyway?
You were shagging him, weren't you?

45
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:02,636
More importantly, I was in love
with him, truth be known.

46
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:06,511
Then you found out he was shagging
that drip from Circulation.

47
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,744
Which is when I stopped
shagging him.

48
00:04:08,954 --> 00:04:11,354
We shouldn't be talking
about this at the office party.

49
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:13,923
But I always see you two together.

50
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:16,890
He cheated on you,
but you stayed friends?

51
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:22,096
I was head over heels, you know?
Everyone knew.

52
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:25,099
- Does it look like I'm crying right now?
- No, no, no.

53
00:04:25,304 --> 00:04:28,239
No, it just looks like it's the smoke
from my cigarette.

54
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:31,975
Did he ever actually tell you
that he loved you back?

55
00:04:32,177 --> 00:04:36,443
Yes. Three, almost four times.
And when I reminded him of that...

56
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:38,981
...he said it must have been an answer
to a question.

57
00:04:39,184 --> 00:04:42,517
Which, by the way,
it absolutely was not.

58
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:46,851
You know, Iris, when you catch
your guy with another woman...

59
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:49,152
...you're not supposed
to stay friends with him.

60
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:51,454
You're supposed to never
talk to the prick again.

61
00:04:51,664 --> 00:04:54,929
You're supposed to throw things
at him, scream, call him names.

62
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:56,692
Not do his blooming laundry.

63
00:04:56,902 --> 00:04:58,392
I don't do his laundry.

64
00:04:58,604 --> 00:05:01,368
Did someone tell you
I do his laundry?

65
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:03,774
No, no, all we do now is...

66
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:06,471
...we e-mail.

67
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:08,306
Not when he's with her, of course.

68
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:12,109
Also when he's not with her,
we talk on the phone.

69
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:16,721
Sometimes for hours. And then
there's the occasional long lunch.

70
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:19,720
You know, I never realized
how pathetic you are.

71
00:05:19,925 --> 00:05:21,449
Really?

72
00:05:21,927 --> 00:05:24,862
Oh, God. I'm so aware of it.

73
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:27,464
They always know just
how to get us, don't they?

74
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:29,834
He knows whenever he wants
back in your life...

75
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:33,061
Actually, he has made some small
comments like that recently.

76
00:05:33,272 --> 00:05:35,240
He hasn't exactly come
right out and said it...

77
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:37,341
Iris, did you file your story?

78
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:41,980
Oh, no, not yet.
Down to the wire. Sorry.

79
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:43,946
Better go.

80
00:05:46,518 --> 00:05:49,783
- Groom's best friend spoke...

81
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:54,551
...for many guests
when he said, "Hilary...

82
00:05:55,928 --> 00:05:58,658
...will open Edward's eyes...

83
00:05:58,864 --> 00:06:02,231
...and round out his life."

84
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:05,028
Okay, I've got a question for you.

85
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:11,341
What's it like to be the only one
committed to work...

86
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:13,101
...while the rest of us
are slumming?

87
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:15,280
You mean what's it like
to be the only one...

88
00:06:15,481 --> 00:06:17,278
...not to finish their work on time?

89
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:20,111
Hold on. Don't... Don't go.

90
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:23,154
Is it fun having a brain
that works that fast?

91
00:06:23,355 --> 00:06:25,255
- Shut up.
- No, I mean it.

92
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:28,349
Probably a brilliant finish too.

93
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,619
I assure you it's not.

94
00:06:31,897 --> 00:06:34,957
- Hi, Simpkey.
- Hi.

95
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:40,094
Your column today was fantastic.

96
00:06:40,305 --> 00:06:42,739
God, I loved that line:

97
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:48,077
"The onrushing stripping of dignity
and thought from British lives."

98
00:06:48,781 --> 00:06:50,146
Great writing.

99
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:52,911
Hey, I got you something
for Christmas.

100
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:56,679
That's convenient
because I got you something too.

101
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,317
Darling, I don't actually
have my gift with me.

102
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:05,697
In fact, I probably mislaid it,
but I know I got you something.

103
00:07:05,898 --> 00:07:08,526
I suspect it's somewhere in my car,
want to know what it is?

104
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:12,232
No. No, no, that's okay.

105
00:07:12,438 --> 00:07:14,497
I know you're gonna look hot in it.

106
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,470
Well, let's hope you find it, then.

107
00:07:18,277 --> 00:07:20,575
Not exactly something hot...

108
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:23,577
...but happy Christmas.

109
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:26,850
Thank you.

110
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:31,454
I didn't think we'd get a chance
to do this this year.

111
00:07:31,657 --> 00:07:33,989
Remember last Christmas,
we exchanged gifts in March.

112
00:07:34,193 --> 00:07:35,922
This is good.

113
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:37,891
We're getting better.

114
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:42,658
You stinker.

115
00:07:45,571 --> 00:07:47,471
It's a first edition.

116
00:07:47,673 --> 00:07:49,106
Where did you find it?

117
00:07:49,308 --> 00:07:53,506
Buried in that little place we found
in Covent Garden that time.

118
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:58,113
Why are you so great?

119
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:02,713
Everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

120
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:05,355
Just a couple of minutes.
Thank you.

121
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:09,292
I hate it that we can never talk.

122
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:12,621
Hate it.

123
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:16,597
Well, first of all, a very
happy Christmas to every one of you.

124
00:08:16,802 --> 00:08:17,928
Happy Christmas.

125
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:21,834
Now, we're not officially closed,
as you very well know.

126
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,065
But we are going to try
and get by this week...

127
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:26,938
...with a smaller-than-normal staff.

128
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:30,915
Now, before some of you
rush off on holiday...

129
00:08:31,116 --> 00:08:34,882
...I do have one
rather important announcement.

130
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:36,782
Now, this affects Iris.

131
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:40,220
- Iris Simpkins, where are you?
- Here, sir.

132
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:43,189
- Iris, I have a tip for you.
- Excellent.

133
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:46,558
A wedding was privately
announced earlier today...

134
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:50,132
...that I don't believe any other paper
in town knows about.

135
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:54,863
And I want you to be the first to report
on this particular union...

136
00:08:55,073 --> 00:09:00,067
...as it is between two of our
most esteemed colleagues.

137
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:04,181
May I introduce the newly engaged
Sarah Smith-Alcott...

138
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:07,978
...and Jasper Bloom!

139
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:10,746
Come on.

140
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:24,494
If I had known this was going
to happen, I'd have worn my good suit.

141
00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:25,121
Amanda!

142
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:32,958
Amanda.

143
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:38,697
Look, may I just say again...

144
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:41,236
...that I did not sleep with her?

145
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,001
Right, because your receptionist
needs to work till 3 in the morning.

146
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:48,338
A bunch of us were working all night.
She wanted to hang out.

147
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:51,948
Okay. Then swear on my life
that you didn't sleep with her.

148
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,777
Come on.

149
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:55,077
Go ahead.

150
00:11:55,287 --> 00:11:57,482
Look, I don't wanna...
I'm not gonna...

151
00:11:57,689 --> 00:11:59,384
Your receptionist, Ethan?

152
00:11:59,624 --> 00:12:02,024
This is why I knew we were smart
never to get married.

153
00:12:02,227 --> 00:12:04,354
I told you never to get rid
of your house.

154
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:06,997
Somewhere inside
I knew this about you.

155
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:09,429
First of all, can you please
calm down?

156
00:12:09,634 --> 00:12:11,295
Because I did not
sleep with her.

157
00:12:11,503 --> 00:12:13,596
Secondly, we've had problems
for over a year.

158
00:12:13,805 --> 00:12:16,273
And I know you don't wanna deal
with that, but we have.

159
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:19,444
Oh, I am well aware we've
had problems for the last year.

160
00:12:19,644 --> 00:12:22,477
If I work a little bit too much,
I never stop hearing about it.

161
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:25,081
But if you work too much,
maestro...

162
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:28,184
...it's for the sake of your music.
- "Lf" you work too much?

163
00:12:28,387 --> 00:12:30,184
Amanda, you cut
75 trailers this year.

164
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:33,324
You put a cutting room in the house
and sleep with your BlackBerry.

165
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:35,720
And I'm not gonna have
a conversation about sex...

166
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:37,895
...because I can't remember
the last time we did it.

167
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:40,587
Come on, nobody has time for sex.

168
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,267
That's not entirely true.

169
00:12:43,702 --> 00:12:46,136
That's it!
You absolutely slept with her!

170
00:12:46,338 --> 00:12:48,067
Seriously, you have to get out.

171
00:12:48,273 --> 00:12:49,240
Oh, God.

172
00:12:49,441 --> 00:12:51,375
You know what I really think, Ethan?

173
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:54,443
- I don't think you ever really loved me.
- Oh, please.

174
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:59,140
You loved the idea of you and me, but
not so much me. Not me, not really.

175
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:03,082
Look, I did the best I could.
Is anybody good enough for that job?

176
00:13:05,157 --> 00:13:08,058
I will send you your things.

177
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:11,729
You know you do this, right?

178
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,956
I mean, you screw up
every relationship you've ever been in.

179
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:16,657
It's what you do.

180
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,998
You didn't really wanna be a couple!
You resist it in your own way!

181
00:13:22,207 --> 00:13:23,435
Shut up!

182
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:25,769
And it's hard to detect
how you even do it...

183
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:28,605
...because nobody's quite
as smart as you!

184
00:13:29,047 --> 00:13:31,015
So you're hard to catch at it.

185
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:34,014
But it always surfaces
and this is what happens.

186
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:36,551
- What happens?
- Things end.

187
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:38,450
Just like you knew they would.

188
00:13:38,657 --> 00:13:41,888
Amanda, you know how I feel
about you. There's nobody like you.

189
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:43,993
You just don't wanna be
what I need.

190
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:45,595
- Well, not what I "need."
- What?

191
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:47,788
I mean...
You know what I mean.

192
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:51,298
You know, I would never cheat on you,
not under any conditions.

193
00:13:51,503 --> 00:13:53,061
Neither would I, okay?

194
00:13:53,271 --> 00:13:56,104
Look at me. I'm down here
sweating like a pig. And look at you.

195
00:13:56,308 --> 00:13:59,004
The only woman on Earth
who breaks up with her boyfriend...

196
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:01,475
...and doesn't even shed a tear?

197
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,671
I mean,
that's gotta mean something, right?

198
00:14:03,882 --> 00:14:06,908
Why does it bug you so much
that I can't cry?

199
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:11,050
Esophageal spasm.

200
00:14:11,256 --> 00:14:13,349
Oh, God, it's a big one.

201
00:14:14,993 --> 00:14:19,987
- No, it's okay. I'll be all right.
- I know, I know. I'm thinking about me.

202
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:22,632
Ethan. Look, it's over.

203
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,564
You know, we might as well
be honest with each other.

204
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,795
Just tell me.

205
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,474
Did you sleep with her?

206
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:32,808
Just say it.

207
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:36,606
What's the difference at this point,
right? I mean, why torture me?

208
00:14:37,382 --> 00:14:40,044
Just put me out of my misery.

209
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:44,011
- What are we doing here...?
- Okay.

210
00:14:48,326 --> 00:14:52,990
Yes, okay? I slept with her.
Are you happy?

211
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,259
I've been sleeping with her.
She's in love with me. She's young.

212
00:14:57,469 --> 00:15:00,267
Look, this is not a proud moment
for me.

213
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:02,303
I mean, you should just know that.

214
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:06,768
Amanda!

215
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:15,717
Did you say, am I happy?

216
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:19,288
I didn't mean that. You get me nuts
sometimes, I say things I don't mean.

217
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:21,220
In the world of love, Ethan...

218
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:23,189
...not that I'm such a genius at it...

219
00:15:23,395 --> 00:15:26,364
...but in the world of love,
cheating is not acceptable.

220
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:27,930
No matter what you think...

221
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:31,967
I know you have a very high opinion
of yourself, but this isn't all me.

222
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,730
- Okay.
- So when you're not in such a rage...

223
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,306
...I think you'll see that too.
- Yeah, maybe.

224
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:41,138
Maybe when I stop having visions
of you two together...

225
00:15:41,346 --> 00:15:43,041
...I will see your side.

226
00:15:47,552 --> 00:15:48,985
You gotta be...

227
00:15:57,862 --> 00:15:59,693
Punched him in the face.

228
00:16:03,335 --> 00:16:05,530
- Is this a bad time?
- No, no, I'm just...

229
00:16:05,737 --> 00:16:07,932
- I'm just flipping out a little bit.
- Oh, okay.

230
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:11,267
God. Okay... No. I'm okay.
God, why would this happen?

231
00:16:11,476 --> 00:16:13,569
No. You know what? I'm all right.

232
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:16,069
Hi.

233
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:18,314
What's up?

234
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:19,875
Ben needs you.

235
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:22,778
Rebecca Green was just your
average 20-year-old.

236
00:16:22,988 --> 00:16:27,118
Until the father she never knew left
her something she never expected.

237
00:16:27,325 --> 00:16:29,054
Don't scream.

238
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,694
- Your father left you something.
- I never met my father.

239
00:16:31,896 --> 00:16:34,524
- Now you know he was interesting.
- Lindsay Lohan.

240
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:36,826
James Franco.

241
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:40,935
- Deception.
- You happen to have two guns?

242
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:43,004
I didn't think one would be enough.

243
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,436
Christmas Day.

244
00:16:45,477 --> 00:16:47,604
Amazing! It finally looks like a hit.

245
00:16:47,812 --> 00:16:49,643
And that is why they pay you
the big bucks.

246
00:16:49,848 --> 00:16:52,476
I think we should go back
to the original cut on the end.

247
00:16:52,684 --> 00:16:54,242
- It's so much stronger.
- I agree.

248
00:16:54,452 --> 00:16:56,750
And make "Christmas Day"
twice as big...

249
00:16:56,955 --> 00:17:00,447
...but try it in a red. Like a happy red,
not like a Scorsese red.

250
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:02,092
Happy red.

251
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:06,221
Okay, so we're done.

252
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:08,830
- Great.
- All right.

253
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:12,595
Hey, you know, let's just take off
for a few weeks.

254
00:17:12,804 --> 00:17:15,102
- Yeah.
- What do you mean? I'm not kidding.

255
00:17:15,306 --> 00:17:18,173
You always say that
this is our busiest time.

256
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:20,367
I need to get out of town.

257
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:22,944
You know? I think I need
some peace and quiet...

258
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:25,844
...or whatever it is people
go away for.

259
00:17:26,051 --> 00:17:27,882
You know what I really wanna do?

260
00:17:28,086 --> 00:17:30,316
I wanna eat carbs without
wanting to kill myself.

261
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:35,858
I wanna read a book.
Not just a magazine. An actual book.

262
00:17:36,061 --> 00:17:40,122
For years, I read these reviews,
I buy the books, but I never read them.

263
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:43,164
Did you read that article in
The New York Times last Sunday?

264
00:17:43,368 --> 00:17:46,394
Severe stress makes women
age prematurely...

265
00:17:46,604 --> 00:17:49,004
...because stress causes DNA
in our cells to shrink...

266
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:50,902
...until they can no longer replicate.

267
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:53,009
So when we're stressed,
we look haggard.

268
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:56,339
- This is just women, not men.
- I'm sorry.

269
00:17:56,548 --> 00:17:57,640
They used to say that...

270
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:01,012
...single women over 35 were
more likely to be killed by a terrorist...

271
00:18:01,219 --> 00:18:03,050
...than to get married.
That was horrible.

272
00:18:03,254 --> 00:18:06,155
But now our generation
is also not getting married.

273
00:18:06,357 --> 00:18:09,622
And bonus, real terrorists
actually became part of our lives.

274
00:18:09,828 --> 00:18:13,389
So the stress of it all shows up on our
faces, making us look haggard.

275
00:18:13,598 --> 00:18:15,793
While Ethan goes on
looking cute forever...

276
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,696
...shtupping his
24-year-old receptionist!

277
00:18:18,903 --> 00:18:20,962
Oh, my God!

278
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:22,733
See what I mean?

279
00:18:22,941 --> 00:18:25,432
I need a vacation.

280
00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:28,412
Okay, where do I wanna go?

281
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,309
By myself at Christmas.

282
00:18:33,017 --> 00:18:35,952
By myself depressed at Christmas.

283
00:18:37,188 --> 00:18:39,816
All alone on vacation.

284
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:44,394
Alone, alone.

285
00:18:44,963 --> 00:18:47,022
Totally alone.

286
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,978
Please, just give me one.

287
00:19:05,183 --> 00:19:06,411
One tear.

288
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:17,359
Okay. Moving on.

289
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,195
"Worry-Free Vacations."

290
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:23,264
Good. Where's that?

291
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:25,299
Bora Bora.

292
00:19:26,237 --> 00:19:28,933
"Kayak for one?" No, thank you.

293
00:19:29,908 --> 00:19:32,638
"Vacation Rentals." I could do that.

294
00:19:32,844 --> 00:19:35,870
Hole up in a house somewhere.
Disappear for a few weeks.

295
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,513
I like that idea.

296
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:40,115
"Where do you wanna go
on your next vacation?"

297
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:41,876
"Click here and pick a country."

298
00:19:42,787 --> 00:19:44,311
Where do they speak English?

299
00:19:46,491 --> 00:19:47,924
"Click on a town or city."

300
00:19:48,126 --> 00:19:49,957
Let's see. Cotswolds.

301
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:53,827
"Barn converted to modern house
in the beautiful Cotswolds."

302
00:19:54,766 --> 00:19:57,257
Which looks exactly like the Valley.

303
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:00,167
Surrey. "Christmas in the country."

304
00:20:00,371 --> 00:20:04,398
"A fairy-tale English cottage
set in a tranquil country garden.

305
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:09,239
Snuggle up by an old stone fireplace
and enjoy a cup of cocoa.

306
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:13,474
An enchanting oasis of tranquility
in a quiet English hamlet...

307
00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:16,848
...just 40 minutes
from exciting London."

308
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:19,788
Yeah.

309
00:21:05,703 --> 00:21:07,864
What am I doing?

310
00:21:13,378 --> 00:21:15,278
Low point.

311
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,575
Low point.

312
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,255
"I'm interested... Renting your house.

313
00:21:30,728 --> 00:21:34,027
I'm wondering if your house
is available this Christmas.

314
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:38,931
Because if it is,
you could be a real lifesaver."

315
00:21:43,408 --> 00:21:44,875
"I know it's late to be asking...

316
00:21:45,076 --> 00:21:48,239
...but if you're at all interested,
please contact me."

317
00:21:54,752 --> 00:21:58,449
"I'm very interested, but the cottage
is only available for home exchange."

318
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,953
"Home exchange"? What is that?

319
00:22:00,892 --> 00:22:03,224
"We switch houses, cars,
everything.

320
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:05,696
I haven't done it before,
but friends have."

321
00:22:06,731 --> 00:22:08,722
Where are you?

322
00:22:10,568 --> 00:22:13,196
Please say somewhere far away.

323
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,067
"L.A."

324
00:22:19,644 --> 00:22:22,374
Never been there.
Always wanted to go.

325
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,780
I'm Iris, by the way.

326
00:22:25,616 --> 00:22:27,607
I'm very normal.

327
00:22:28,453 --> 00:22:33,015
Neat freak. Healthy. Non-smoker.

328
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:35,050
Single.

329
00:22:37,395 --> 00:22:39,590
Hate my horrible life.

330
00:22:39,797 --> 00:22:41,992
I'm Amanda.

331
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,327
Loner, loser and complicated wreck.

332
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:46,264
Hi.

333
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:48,261
Hi.

334
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:53,308
I must say...

335
00:22:54,078 --> 00:22:56,137
...your house looks idyllic.

336
00:22:56,347 --> 00:22:59,180
"Just what I need." Really?

337
00:22:59,817 --> 00:23:02,581
What does your place look like?

338
00:23:02,787 --> 00:23:06,416
My place is nice,
but it's a little bigger than yours.

339
00:23:23,174 --> 00:23:25,608
"Are there any men in your town?"

340
00:23:28,312 --> 00:23:29,904
Honestly?

341
00:23:56,007 --> 00:23:57,804
"Tomorrow's perfect."

342
00:24:03,648 --> 00:24:08,312
Okay. We are on for two weeks...

343
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:09,918
...starting tomorrow.

344
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,767
Hi.

345
00:24:25,336 --> 00:24:27,270
- Hi.
- How are you?

346
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:31,672
- Fine.
- Honey, we're sitting there.

347
00:24:33,744 --> 00:24:35,234
Sorry.

348
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,741
Oh, yes. There it is.

349
00:24:41,953 --> 00:24:44,854
- Well, hello, dear.
- Hello.

350
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,546
Excuse me.

351
00:24:47,492 --> 00:24:49,119
There we go.

352
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:51,653
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, it's okay.

353
00:24:51,863 --> 00:24:53,524
- Did you step on her foot?
- It's okay.

354
00:24:53,731 --> 00:24:55,289
Oh, dear. Clumsy me.

355
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:29,116
Amanda Woods is proud to present
Her Life.

356
00:26:29,327 --> 00:26:31,318
- She had it all:
- Yes, that's it.

357
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:33,554
The job. The house.

358
00:26:34,465 --> 00:26:35,557
The guy.

359
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:37,131
This holiday season...

360
00:26:38,135 --> 00:26:41,696
... find out
what Amanda doesn't have.

361
00:27:19,277 --> 00:27:21,006
This is amazing, this is amazing!

362
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,740
Oh, look at that.

363
00:27:53,544 --> 00:27:55,034
Madam?

364
00:27:57,281 --> 00:27:58,248
Madam?

365
00:28:00,718 --> 00:28:02,151
- Madam?
- Yeah.

366
00:28:02,353 --> 00:28:03,547
- We're here.
- Okay.

367
00:28:14,265 --> 00:28:15,391
This can't be it.

368
00:28:16,033 --> 00:28:17,830
No, it's just down that lane.

369
00:28:18,035 --> 00:28:21,630
But the thing is, I'll never be able
to turn this around at the other end.

370
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,500
Think you can make it from here?

371
00:28:25,142 --> 00:28:26,666
No.

372
00:28:47,698 --> 00:28:51,361
Hey. You wouldn't happen to know
where Rosehill Cottage is?

373
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:54,629
Go right at the bridge, and then
just keep going. Way down there.

374
00:29:16,026 --> 00:29:17,459
Okay.

375
00:29:21,432 --> 00:29:22,490
I'm here!

376
00:29:39,517 --> 00:29:41,747
Holy shit.

377
00:30:04,074 --> 00:30:07,202
Oh, my God!

378
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,089
Okay, that'll be interesting.

379
00:30:59,763 --> 00:31:03,699
Get in the... Get in there. Okay.

380
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:05,459
Cute dress.

381
00:31:06,937 --> 00:31:08,962
Oh, suitcase.

382
00:31:15,913 --> 00:31:17,505
Okay.

383
00:31:19,984 --> 00:31:21,645
Now what?

384
00:31:24,388 --> 00:31:25,480
I can do this.

385
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,390
I can drive
on the wrong side of the road...

386
00:31:28,592 --> 00:31:30,082
...and the wrong side of the car.

387
00:31:30,294 --> 00:31:32,319
Just stay focused.

388
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,624
Oh, please do not hit me!

389
00:31:38,903 --> 00:31:40,427
Okay, I hate this.

390
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:46,176
Oh, God.

391
00:31:46,644 --> 00:31:48,976
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

392
00:31:56,587 --> 00:31:57,918
- Move out of the way!
- Watch it!

393
00:31:58,122 --> 00:32:00,215
Sorry. Stop!

394
00:32:01,058 --> 00:32:02,525
Oh, God.

395
00:32:06,463 --> 00:32:08,294
I need a drink.

396
00:32:29,587 --> 00:32:31,077
Someone's having a party tonight.

397
00:32:33,223 --> 00:32:34,884
Oh, yeah.

398
00:32:35,092 --> 00:32:37,219
- They went to the shops.
- Didn't see anything.

399
00:32:39,096 --> 00:32:42,031
Came home,
and had a bit of a kiss and cuddle.

400
00:32:42,232 --> 00:32:43,199
The end.

401
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,335
Rebecca Green
was just your average 20-year-old.

402
00:32:46,537 --> 00:32:48,232
Until the father she never knew...

403
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:50,498
... left her something
she never expected.

404
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:53,609
- You happen to have two guns?
- I didn't think one would be enough.

405
00:32:53,811 --> 00:32:55,938
Deception. Christmas Day.

406
00:32:56,447 --> 00:33:00,679
And that's why they pay me
the big bucks.

407
00:33:00,884 --> 00:33:03,682
And now the weather. First,
Northern England and North Wales...

408
00:33:03,887 --> 00:33:06,981
... will have sleet or snow in the
morning and again later in the day.

409
00:34:55,132 --> 00:34:56,121
Blinked.

410
00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:39,406
Oh, that's intense.

411
00:35:46,383 --> 00:35:48,044
Oh, no. "Gate"?

412
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:56,417
- Who was he with?
- Maggie.

413
00:35:56,627 --> 00:35:58,959
- The flutes. This is the best part.
- One second.

414
00:35:59,396 --> 00:36:01,296
Hello... Hello?

415
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:05,927
- Hello? Can you hear me?
- Yeah, it's Miles. Amanda?

416
00:36:06,136 --> 00:36:08,604
No, I'm sorry.
Amanda's not here, I'm afraid.

417
00:36:08,806 --> 00:36:12,572
I'm trying to figure out
how to open the gate. Oh, fu...

418
00:36:13,777 --> 00:36:14,744
Very nice.

419
00:36:15,445 --> 00:36:17,811
If you heard that, I'm sorry.

420
00:36:23,086 --> 00:36:24,314
- Hi.
- Hi.

421
00:36:24,521 --> 00:36:26,716
I'm so sorry.
I'm new at the gate thing.

422
00:36:26,924 --> 00:36:28,414
It's okay. It was pretty funny.

423
00:36:30,327 --> 00:36:31,919
I'm Miles. I work with Ethan.

424
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:33,797
Ethan?

425
00:36:34,398 --> 00:36:36,423
- Amanda's ex.
- Oh, right.

426
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,126
Right.

427
00:36:38,335 --> 00:36:40,633
Know when she'll be back?
Supposed to pick up things.

428
00:36:40,838 --> 00:36:42,806
Amanda's in England,
actually, on holiday.

429
00:36:43,006 --> 00:36:44,564
I'm staying here while she's away.

430
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:49,144
- You okay?
- Yes.

431
00:36:49,346 --> 00:36:51,280
Yeah, something just
blew into my eye.

432
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:53,676
Oh, I hate that. Let me see.

433
00:36:53,884 --> 00:36:57,183
Yep, you got something in
your eyelash. You want me to get it?

434
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:00,623
- Okay.
- Okay.

435
00:37:00,824 --> 00:37:03,190
- Yeah, Santa Anas.
- Pardon?

436
00:37:03,393 --> 00:37:05,793
The wind. It's what makes
it so warm this time of year.

437
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,862
Legend has it,
when the Santa Anas blow...

438
00:37:09,066 --> 00:37:11,034
...all bets are off.
Anything can happen.

439
00:37:11,735 --> 00:37:14,761
That's it. You okay?

440
00:37:16,073 --> 00:37:18,507
Better. Thank you.

441
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:25,043
So you needed to?

442
00:37:25,249 --> 00:37:26,807
Pick up Ethan's laptop.

443
00:37:27,818 --> 00:37:29,308
And you're his?

444
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,953
Oh, well, I'm a film composer, too,
like Ethan, but...

445
00:37:32,155 --> 00:37:34,817
- Did you compose this? It's beautiful.
- This?

446
00:37:35,025 --> 00:37:36,617
Yes, I did. I wrote this.

447
00:37:36,827 --> 00:37:39,125
No, I didn't. I wish I did.

448
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:42,457
This is the great Ennio Morricone.

449
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,458
Would you mind
coming back tomorrow?

450
00:37:44,668 --> 00:37:46,863
I just want to check this
with Amanda's assistant.

451
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,037
Sure.

452
00:37:48,238 --> 00:37:50,172
- I'm Iris, by the way.
- Miles.

453
00:37:50,641 --> 00:37:52,802
- Right.
- And this is my Maggie.

454
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,003
I mean, just Maggie.
Not "my" Maggie.

455
00:37:57,214 --> 00:37:59,079
- Hello.
- Hey.

456
00:37:59,283 --> 00:38:00,716
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

457
00:38:00,918 --> 00:38:02,579
Okay.

458
00:38:04,421 --> 00:38:05,911
Don't blow away.

459
00:38:06,623 --> 00:38:08,090
I won't.

460
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,384
Anything can happen.

461
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:56,336
Five, six, seven, eight, nine,
10, 11, 12. One a.m. In London.

462
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,517
Who is it?

463
00:39:41,718 --> 00:39:43,913
It's me. Hurry up. It's freezing.

464
00:39:44,888 --> 00:39:46,913
- Who are you?
- Iris, open the door...

465
00:39:47,124 --> 00:39:49,684
...or I swear I'm gonna take a leak
all over your...

466
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,593
You're not Iris.

467
00:39:56,233 --> 00:39:58,929
Or if you are,
I'm much drunker than I realized.

468
00:39:59,136 --> 00:40:00,933
I'm sorry for my profanity.

469
00:40:01,138 --> 00:40:03,800
I wasn't expecting you.

470
00:40:04,441 --> 00:40:07,604
Well, I wasn't expecting you either.

471
00:40:08,979 --> 00:40:10,139
Nevertheless, may I just...?

472
00:40:11,848 --> 00:40:14,908
Yeah. Of course. Sure.
You had to... Yeah.

473
00:40:15,852 --> 00:40:18,184
I'm Graham. Iris' brother.

474
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,417
Brother.

475
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:22,558
I'm Amanda Woods.
I'm staying here.

476
00:40:22,993 --> 00:40:24,688
Amandawoods?
Is that all one word?

477
00:40:25,729 --> 00:40:27,720
No. No, it's not.

478
00:40:28,231 --> 00:40:30,495
Brother? Oh, my God.

479
00:40:34,337 --> 00:40:37,033
So Iris is... Where is...?
Where is she?

480
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,537
She didn't tell you?

481
00:40:38,742 --> 00:40:41,905
She could have done...

482
00:40:43,447 --> 00:40:45,847
...but as previously stated...

483
00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:49,541
...l'm... I've just... I've been...

484
00:40:49,753 --> 00:40:52,051
She's in Los Angeles.

485
00:40:52,255 --> 00:40:55,588
That's not possible.
Iris never goes anywhere.

486
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:57,851
Well, we have that in common.

487
00:40:58,061 --> 00:41:01,861
No, she listed this cottage on a
home-exchange website and I found it.

488
00:41:02,065 --> 00:41:05,091
We switched houses for two weeks.
For the holiday.

489
00:41:05,302 --> 00:41:09,033
She's in L.A. At my house
and I'm here.

490
00:41:09,573 --> 00:41:11,768
- People actually do that?
- Apparently.

491
00:41:11,975 --> 00:41:15,433
Yeah. I mean, it seems.
Here I am in my pajamas.

492
00:41:15,979 --> 00:41:19,142
She did ring me last night. I didn't
get a chance to get back to her.

493
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:21,214
I feel awful now.

494
00:41:23,687 --> 00:41:26,247
Would you mind if I sat?
I feel like I might bump into you.

495
00:41:26,456 --> 00:41:28,720
Sure. Yeah. Sit.

496
00:41:34,431 --> 00:41:35,625
You okay?

497
00:41:35,832 --> 00:41:38,062
Yeah, I'm good.

498
00:41:39,202 --> 00:41:41,033
Look, I'm sorry about the intrusion.

499
00:41:41,705 --> 00:41:44,833
Although I may not appear it,
I am in fact Iris'...

500
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:47,373
...semi-respectable big brother.

501
00:41:48,211 --> 00:41:51,180
But on the rare...
Or lately not-so-rare occasion...

502
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:53,747
...that I frequent the local pub...

503
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:57,317
...and get inordinately pissed,
my little sister puts me up...

504
00:41:57,721 --> 00:41:59,313
...so I don't get behind the wheel.

505
00:41:59,523 --> 00:42:04,586
Pathetic explanation, but unfortunately
it's become a bit of a routine.

506
00:42:06,229 --> 00:42:08,197
So how's it going so far?

507
00:42:08,398 --> 00:42:10,923
I mean, up until I showed up
and ruined your night.

508
00:42:11,134 --> 00:42:14,570
Well, it's not going so great.

509
00:42:14,771 --> 00:42:16,739
Yeah, I'm leaving tomorrow
on a noon plane.

510
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:19,433
When did you get here?

511
00:42:21,545 --> 00:42:23,069
About six hours ago.

512
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,840
We've made a great impression
on you, haven't we?

513
00:42:26,049 --> 00:42:27,778
No, it's not that. It's just that...

514
00:42:27,984 --> 00:42:30,179
You know,
I'm not quite myself right now.

515
00:42:30,387 --> 00:42:32,048
I came here on a stupid whim.

516
00:42:32,255 --> 00:42:35,588
Honestly, I've never thought about
anything less. It's very unlike me.

517
00:42:36,326 --> 00:42:38,521
Would you like something to drink?

518
00:42:38,728 --> 00:42:41,595
Glass of water? Tea?

519
00:42:41,798 --> 00:42:42,765
Wine, maybe?

520
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:47,694
I think there's a bottle of brandy.
Fancy a glass?

521
00:42:49,272 --> 00:42:50,933
- Sure.
- Good.

522
00:42:52,509 --> 00:42:56,673
So... I'm sorry, I've totally blanked
and forgotten your name.

523
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,211
Amanda.

524
00:42:58,415 --> 00:42:59,882
So, Amanda...

525
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:01,414
...you're not married, are you?

526
00:43:02,352 --> 00:43:04,183
Why? Do I look not married?

527
00:43:04,387 --> 00:43:08,653
No. It was just a backwards way
of asking if you were married.

528
00:43:08,858 --> 00:43:10,723
No, not at all.

529
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:14,556
I don't know what that means.

530
00:43:15,131 --> 00:43:17,361
I mean, no, I'm not married.

531
00:43:20,003 --> 00:43:20,970
Me neither.

532
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,565
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

533
00:43:35,151 --> 00:43:36,641
So is it horrible if I stay?

534
00:43:36,853 --> 00:43:38,753
I'll be gone
before you even wake up.

535
00:43:38,955 --> 00:43:41,219
I promise you will never
lay eyes on me again.

536
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,385
Of... No, that's fine. Sure.

537
00:43:46,596 --> 00:43:48,894
- Thank you.
- Let me just get you a blanket.

538
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:51,397
In the cupboard,
on top of the Scrabble.

539
00:43:53,536 --> 00:43:58,997
So why is it you aren't
quite yourself at the moment?

540
00:43:59,209 --> 00:44:03,669
Well, I just broke up with someone.

541
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,211
Yesterday.

542
00:44:05,415 --> 00:44:07,042
And I guess
what I was feeling...

543
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,616
...was that I didn't wanna be alone
over the holidays.

544
00:44:09,819 --> 00:44:11,582
I thought that
if I was somewhere else...

545
00:44:11,788 --> 00:44:13,278
...I wouldn't realize I was alone.

546
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:15,788
Then I got here
and never felt more alone in my life.

547
00:44:15,992 --> 00:44:17,755
Big surprise.

548
00:44:17,961 --> 00:44:19,758
Bet you're glad you knocked
on this door.

549
00:44:19,963 --> 00:44:22,056
I am, actually.

550
00:44:24,868 --> 00:44:26,768
Yeah, well...

551
00:44:27,737 --> 00:44:31,366
Sorry and good night.

552
00:44:31,574 --> 00:44:33,201
Sweet dreams.

553
00:44:39,115 --> 00:44:41,743
Do you think you could?

554
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:44,348
Would you mind...

555
00:44:45,221 --> 00:44:46,415
...trying that again?

556
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:00,993
Bad?

557
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,432
Weird.

558
00:45:07,477 --> 00:45:09,172
Kissing a total stranger.

559
00:45:09,379 --> 00:45:12,143
Really? I do it all the time.

560
00:45:14,684 --> 00:45:16,447
Let me try this.

561
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,357
Maybe if I closed my eyes.

562
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:50,945
You know, given that
I'm in a bit of a personal crisis...

563
00:45:51,154 --> 00:45:54,817
...and I find myself
in a total stranger's home...

564
00:45:55,024 --> 00:45:57,686
...in a town that I can't
actually remember the name of...

565
00:45:57,894 --> 00:46:00,226
...and considering
that you showed up...

566
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:03,490
...and you're, like,
insanely good-looking...

567
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,999
...and really drunk and probably
won't remember me anyway...

568
00:46:07,203 --> 00:46:10,661
...l'm thinking...

569
00:46:10,874 --> 00:46:12,808
...we should have sex.

570
00:46:13,676 --> 00:46:15,075
If you want.

571
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:18,237
Is that a trick question?

572
00:46:19,249 --> 00:46:21,740
I'm actually serious.

573
00:46:22,252 --> 00:46:26,018
And not that it matters, but I've never
said anything like that in my entire life.

574
00:46:26,623 --> 00:46:27,817
It's just that this whole...

575
00:46:28,024 --> 00:46:31,892
...knowing-I'll-never-see-you-again
thing is kind of exciting.

576
00:46:32,095 --> 00:46:34,188
I mean, this is what a vacation's
supposed to be.

577
00:46:34,397 --> 00:46:37,366
You're supposed to vacate life,
do the unexpected. And you are...

578
00:46:38,101 --> 00:46:40,592
...definitely unexpected.

579
00:46:40,804 --> 00:46:43,364
This all sounded wonderful
till I became the cabana boy.

580
00:46:44,207 --> 00:46:46,334
And you're funny,
which is, like, a bonus.

581
00:46:46,543 --> 00:46:48,238
Yeah? Never meet me
when I'm sober.

582
00:46:48,711 --> 00:46:50,269
Deal.

583
00:46:55,652 --> 00:46:57,586
Oh, also, I should warn you.

584
00:46:58,254 --> 00:47:00,779
I'm not very good at this.

585
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:02,514
"This" being?

586
00:47:03,126 --> 00:47:06,391
- Sex.
- Okay. Now, that cannot be true.

587
00:47:06,596 --> 00:47:09,895
Nevertheless, the guy that I lived with
mentioned it once or twice...

588
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:13,728
...and a girl does not forget
a comment like that. Not even me.

589
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,077
I mean, how bad could I be?

590
00:47:26,282 --> 00:47:30,582
Sex is pretty basic, right? Am I
pretty much talking you out of this?

591
00:47:30,787 --> 00:47:32,516
Strangely, not at all.

592
00:47:32,722 --> 00:47:34,815
How do you feel about foreplay?

593
00:47:35,558 --> 00:47:37,458
I think it's overrated.

594
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:40,891
Significantly overrated.

595
00:47:41,297 --> 00:47:46,132
You are quickly becoming one of
the most interesting girls I've ever met.

596
00:47:56,546 --> 00:47:58,070
Look at you.

597
00:47:58,281 --> 00:48:01,273
You're already better than you think.

598
00:48:16,366 --> 00:48:18,493
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

599
00:48:18,701 --> 00:48:22,637
I lost my contacts
last night somehow.

600
00:48:26,342 --> 00:48:28,310
- Much better.
- Yeah.

601
00:48:29,245 --> 00:48:30,303
Can I help you with that?

602
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,146
I should know how to do this.

603
00:48:37,253 --> 00:48:41,053
You're supposed to
plug them in over here. Right.

604
00:48:49,165 --> 00:48:52,157
- So, Amanda, I just really...
- Yeah. You know...

605
00:48:52,368 --> 00:48:55,701
...listen, you don't have to worry
about a thing here. Okay?

606
00:48:57,707 --> 00:48:58,696
Okay.

607
00:48:58,908 --> 00:49:02,844
I mean, it was great
meeting you and everything.

608
00:49:03,913 --> 00:49:09,044
Definitely. Also, for the record,
your ex-boyfriend is, in my opinion...

609
00:49:09,252 --> 00:49:11,743
...extremely mistaken about you.

610
00:49:12,155 --> 00:49:13,520
Well, yeah, you were drunk.

611
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:16,590
- Not that drunk.
- Yeah.

612
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,021
Oh, that's mine.

613
00:49:19,529 --> 00:49:22,362
Sophie. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to look.

614
00:49:23,299 --> 00:49:24,732
I'll call her back.

615
00:49:29,973 --> 00:49:31,964
Coffee cups.

616
00:49:34,043 --> 00:49:37,035
- Here.
- Thank you.

617
00:49:38,281 --> 00:49:39,248
You don't want one?

618
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:42,181
I should probably be going.

619
00:49:44,687 --> 00:49:48,589
Oh, yeah. You know, I gotta get going
in a few minutes myself.

620
00:49:48,791 --> 00:49:51,385
So listen.

621
00:49:51,594 --> 00:49:54,188
I know you're leaving
and absolutely not interested...

622
00:49:54,397 --> 00:49:57,264
...in getting involved,
but just so you know...

623
00:49:57,467 --> 00:50:00,527
...things in my life
are a little bit complicated...

624
00:50:00,737 --> 00:50:03,035
...and even if you were staying,
I can promise you...

625
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:05,867
...you wouldn't...
- You really don't have to do this.

626
00:50:06,075 --> 00:50:09,511
Look, I'm sort of a mess
in this area myself.

627
00:50:09,712 --> 00:50:13,614
And anyway, I mean,
honestly, we hardly know each other.

628
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,142
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that...

629
00:50:16,352 --> 00:50:20,584
...but I just want to assure you,
you're better off. I'm...

630
00:50:21,324 --> 00:50:22,291
- I'm...
- Okay.

631
00:50:25,128 --> 00:50:26,618
No need to go on. Right.

632
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:30,822
Well, I just want to be sure
you are okay because somehow...

633
00:50:31,034 --> 00:50:36,062
...I find I tend to hurt women
simply by being myself, so...

634
00:50:36,272 --> 00:50:39,264
I'm not going
to fall in love with you, I promise.

635
00:50:40,009 --> 00:50:42,409
Okay. Nicely put. Thank you.

636
00:50:42,612 --> 00:50:47,015
No, it's just that I know myself.
I'm not sure I even fall in love.

637
00:50:47,216 --> 00:50:49,343
Not like the way other people do.

638
00:50:50,253 --> 00:50:51,845
How's that for something to admit?

639
00:50:53,423 --> 00:50:56,187
Well, like I said,
Most Interesting Girl Award.

640
00:50:57,593 --> 00:51:00,357
I'm gonna try to see that
as a compliment.

641
00:51:00,563 --> 00:51:03,657
You should. Absolutely.

642
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,735
Right.

643
00:51:10,106 --> 00:51:12,973
Okay, then. Well...

644
00:51:13,176 --> 00:51:16,202
Utter honesty. Very refreshing.

645
00:51:16,879 --> 00:51:19,973
Well, you probably
won't be hearing from me...

646
00:51:20,183 --> 00:51:22,743
...because even if you wanted to,
and you clearly don't...

647
00:51:22,952 --> 00:51:25,978
...I have the classic
male problem of no follow-through.

648
00:51:26,189 --> 00:51:29,181
Absolutely never remember
to call after a date.

649
00:51:32,462 --> 00:51:35,863
But since this wasn't a date
I guess I'm off the hook.

650
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,124
Exactly.

651
00:51:41,804 --> 00:51:43,669
But what if I wanted to call you?

652
00:51:46,876 --> 00:51:50,039
Right. Sorry. Apparently not
the right thing to say at all.

653
00:51:50,947 --> 00:51:53,882
Well, if your flight's canceled
or for some reason...

654
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:57,052
...you change your mind, I'm having
dinner with some friends...

655
00:51:57,253 --> 00:51:58,379
...at the pub tonight.

656
00:52:00,957 --> 00:52:02,356
And...

657
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:08,019
...if not, then, well...

658
00:52:09,932 --> 00:52:11,422
...you're lovely.

659
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:18,104
So are you.

660
00:52:27,884 --> 00:52:32,150
Attention passengers,
this is the final boarding call...

661
00:52:32,355 --> 00:52:35,415
... for British Airways flight 42.

662
00:52:42,465 --> 00:52:44,262
Amanda wasn't looking for love...

663
00:52:45,668 --> 00:52:49,263
... but that doesn't mean
it didn't find her.

664
00:52:49,472 --> 00:52:50,905
Well, ma'am, you're good to go.

665
00:52:52,608 --> 00:52:53,836
Thank you.

666
00:53:20,236 --> 00:53:23,501
Thank you, Amanda.

667
00:53:45,094 --> 00:53:46,322
Hello?

668
00:53:46,529 --> 00:53:47,689
Where am I finding you?

669
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:51,659
Jasper.

670
00:53:51,868 --> 00:53:54,200
Is it okay that I'm calling you?

671
00:53:56,672 --> 00:53:58,572
I suppose so.

672
00:53:59,075 --> 00:54:00,042
How are you?

673
00:54:00,243 --> 00:54:02,768
Could we start
with a less complicated question?

674
00:54:04,513 --> 00:54:05,707
What's wrong?

675
00:54:05,915 --> 00:54:10,215
I'm having some real problems
with a section of my book.

676
00:54:10,419 --> 00:54:12,683
I can use some Iris.

677
00:54:14,056 --> 00:54:15,887
Would it be awful
if I sent you some pages?

678
00:54:16,092 --> 00:54:18,720
Just tell me if it is.
I don't wanna mess you up. I'll...

679
00:54:18,928 --> 00:54:21,920
I know that you're the only one
who can really help me.

680
00:54:23,065 --> 00:54:25,295
No. Well... I mean...

681
00:54:27,203 --> 00:54:28,670
...if you need me.

682
00:54:28,871 --> 00:54:31,465
Well, you know
you are my little survival kit.

683
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:37,505
So, Simpkey, have you put on
that little red bikini yet?

684
00:54:37,713 --> 00:54:40,546
You know,
the one that unties at the back?

685
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:43,275
How do you remember
my little red bikini?

686
00:54:43,486 --> 00:54:46,478
I remember everything.

687
00:54:46,689 --> 00:54:48,350
Do you?

688
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:52,784
You know, just the other day,
I was just thinking about that time...

689
00:54:52,995 --> 00:54:55,054
Darling, I've just arrived
at Soho House.

690
00:54:55,264 --> 00:54:57,232
I'm meeting some friends for drinks.

691
00:54:57,433 --> 00:54:59,993
- Okay.
- You keep the change.

692
00:55:00,536 --> 00:55:01,798
Bloody cold in here.

693
00:55:02,004 --> 00:55:03,767
Okay, I'm sending you
the pages tomorrow.

694
00:55:03,973 --> 00:55:07,966
Look for them, will you?
And have some fun today, okay?

695
00:55:09,111 --> 00:55:10,738
Okay.

696
00:55:29,298 --> 00:55:30,697
Graham?

697
00:56:02,031 --> 00:56:03,999
Oh, no, is he lost?

698
00:56:17,813 --> 00:56:19,178
Excuse me.

699
00:56:20,383 --> 00:56:23,875
Hello. Can I offer you a lift home?

700
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,752
Why? You know where I live?

701
00:56:27,723 --> 00:56:28,985
I believe I do, yes.

702
00:56:29,191 --> 00:56:31,819
Good. Then that makes one of us.

703
00:56:35,297 --> 00:56:36,924
Your house is lovely.

704
00:56:37,133 --> 00:56:39,397
I've lived here 47 years.

705
00:56:39,602 --> 00:56:42,696
Back then, there were only
six houses on this block.

706
00:56:42,905 --> 00:56:45,135
Every year,
they tear another one down...

707
00:56:45,341 --> 00:56:46,831
...not that I blame them.

708
00:56:47,043 --> 00:56:49,409
They weren't that great
to begin with.

709
00:56:51,614 --> 00:56:55,983
But that's how I got confused.
I didn't recognize one house.

710
00:56:57,253 --> 00:56:59,050
That would be confusing.

711
00:57:00,689 --> 00:57:02,657
What part of England are you from?

712
00:57:04,794 --> 00:57:08,491
- Surrey.
- Cary Grant was from Surrey.

713
00:57:08,697 --> 00:57:10,824
That's right, he was.

714
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:14,427
- How did you know that?
- Oh, he told me once.

715
00:57:14,637 --> 00:57:17,663
Well, I thank you very much,
young lady.

716
00:57:21,544 --> 00:57:23,307
Let me help you with that.

717
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,679
Okay.

718
00:57:25,881 --> 00:57:27,314
L... Thank you.

719
00:57:28,851 --> 00:57:30,045
There you go.

720
00:57:30,252 --> 00:57:32,686
Well, this was some meet-cute.

721
00:57:33,189 --> 00:57:35,749
- Sorry?
- It's how two characters meet...

722
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:37,289
...in a movie.

723
00:57:38,094 --> 00:57:40,722
Say a man and a woman...

724
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:43,398
...both need something to sleep in.

725
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:47,602
And they both go
to the same men's pajama department.

726
00:57:47,803 --> 00:57:50,863
- Right.
- And the man says to the salesman:

727
00:57:51,073 --> 00:57:54,565
"I just need bottoms."
The woman says, "I just need a top."

728
00:57:55,244 --> 00:57:59,010
They look at each other,
and that's the "meet-cute."

729
00:57:59,615 --> 00:58:01,105
Oh, I see.

730
00:58:01,317 --> 00:58:04,115
Of course, this isn't
quite that cute, but...

731
00:58:05,855 --> 00:58:08,653
So you're in the film business?

732
00:58:08,858 --> 00:58:12,487
Was. Yes, yes, I was.

733
00:58:13,195 --> 00:58:15,163
I was a writer.

734
00:58:22,505 --> 00:58:24,200
I could be here till tomorrow.

735
00:58:24,406 --> 00:58:26,135
Oh, here.

736
00:58:26,642 --> 00:58:28,234
Let me.

737
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,211
Thank you.

738
00:59:07,416 --> 00:59:09,441
Oh, my God.

739
00:59:26,035 --> 00:59:28,026
Well, goodbye, then.

740
00:59:29,271 --> 00:59:31,796
I enjoyed our meet-cute.

741
00:59:32,007 --> 00:59:34,032
Well, thank you.
Thank you for rescuing me.

742
00:59:34,577 --> 00:59:37,978
It's a pleasure. Absolutely.

743
00:59:44,653 --> 00:59:47,884
You know, I hope you
don't find this strange...

744
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:51,423
...but I've just arrived here,
and, well, I don't really know anyone.

745
00:59:51,627 --> 00:59:54,528
And I was thinking of going out
for dinner tonight.

746
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:57,494
Well, if you're not busy,
would you like to join me?

747
00:59:58,267 --> 01:00:03,330
Busy? Honey,
I haven't been busy since 1978.

748
01:00:06,609 --> 01:00:09,442
I learned everything
working in this place.

749
01:00:09,645 --> 01:00:11,875
- Best job I ever had.
- Wait, wait, wait.

750
01:00:12,081 --> 01:00:14,276
That was your first job
in Hollywood?

751
01:00:14,483 --> 01:00:16,474
Louis B. Mayer's office boy?

752
01:00:16,952 --> 01:00:21,252
Actually, my first job
was as a Western Union messenger.

753
01:00:21,457 --> 01:00:26,793
That's how I met Mayer. I delivered
a telegram to his office at MGM.

754
01:00:26,996 --> 01:00:30,557
When I walked in, all the girls
in the office were in a tizzy.

755
01:00:30,766 --> 01:00:32,734
Their office boy didn't show up.

756
01:00:33,569 --> 01:00:38,097
I volunteered for the job.
The next day, I was on the payroll.

757
01:00:38,307 --> 01:00:40,832
I was 17 years old.

758
01:00:42,077 --> 01:00:45,945
So was Hollywood really as great
back then as I imagine?

759
01:00:46,148 --> 01:00:47,342
It was better.

760
01:00:50,953 --> 01:00:53,353
You know what I've been
asking myself all night?

761
01:00:53,555 --> 01:00:57,958
What? Why I'm bothering you
with all these questions?

762
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,958
I'm wondering
why a beautiful girl like you...

763
01:01:01,664 --> 01:01:05,065
...would go to a stranger's house
for her Christmas vacation...

764
01:01:05,267 --> 01:01:08,896
...and on top of that, spend Saturday
night with an old cocker like me.

765
01:01:09,638 --> 01:01:10,832
Well, l...

766
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,771
I just wanted to get away
from the people I see all the time.

767
01:01:18,914 --> 01:01:21,747
Well, not all the people.

768
01:01:23,185 --> 01:01:24,413
One person.

769
01:01:24,953 --> 01:01:29,720
I wanted to get away from one guy.

770
01:01:30,592 --> 01:01:36,155
An ex-boyfriend who just got engaged
and forgot to tell me.

771
01:01:36,365 --> 01:01:38,629
- Sorry.
- So he's a schmuck.

772
01:01:38,834 --> 01:01:43,430
As a matter of fact, he is.
A huge schmuck.

773
01:01:43,939 --> 01:01:46,407
- How did you know?
- He let you go.

774
01:01:46,608 --> 01:01:48,439
This is not a hard one to figure out.

775
01:01:49,029 --> 01:01:53,261
Iris, in the movies
we have leading ladies...

776
01:01:53,467 --> 01:01:55,059
...and we have the best friend.

777
01:01:55,535 --> 01:01:58,095
You, I can tell, are a leading lady.

778
01:01:58,305 --> 01:02:01,297
But for some reason,
you're behaving like the best friend.

779
01:02:02,743 --> 01:02:04,142
You're so right.

780
01:02:04,344 --> 01:02:08,508
You're supposed to be the leading
lady of your own life, for God's sake.

781
01:02:10,117 --> 01:02:14,486
Arthur, I've been going
to a therapist for three years.

782
01:02:14,688 --> 01:02:18,351
And she's never explained
anything to me that well.

783
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:21,691
That was brilliant.

784
01:02:22,229 --> 01:02:24,754
Brutal, but brilliant.

785
01:02:25,532 --> 01:02:26,863
Thank you.

786
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:40,371
I haven't had that much to drink in...

787
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,571
What am I saying?

788
01:02:42,783 --> 01:02:47,117
- I've never had that much to drink.
- Yes, I believe no one ever has.

789
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:51,552
Okay, the last thing I remember
was coming in here last night and...

790
01:02:56,263 --> 01:02:59,596
- I had nothing to do with that.
- Oh, I know, but you were here.

791
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,480
- I was.
- Oh, God. So I guess we...

792
01:03:01,305 --> 01:04:01,734
