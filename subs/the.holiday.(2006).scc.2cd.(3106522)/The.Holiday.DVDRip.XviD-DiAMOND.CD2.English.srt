1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,723
- I was.
- Oh, God. So I guess we...

2
00:00:03,924 --> 00:00:06,825
Did we? I mean, did we?

3
00:00:08,162 --> 00:00:10,562
- We didn't?
- We did not.

4
00:00:10,764 --> 00:00:12,561
Oh, thank God.

5
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:17,260
I mean, not "thank God,"
but just thank God.

6
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:20,269
Because I didn't remember...

7
00:00:20,474 --> 00:00:23,500
So why didn't we?
Just remind me a little.

8
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:25,942
Call me old-fashioned...

9
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:29,343
...but one doesn't have sex
with women who are unconscious.

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,950
Unconscious? Oh, God.

11
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:35,315
That must have been
really attractive.

12
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:37,353
Why did you stay?

13
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:39,320
Because you asked me to.

14
00:00:40,728 --> 00:00:42,161
I did, didn't I?

15
00:00:45,065 --> 00:00:48,091
Did I beg at one point?

16
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:54,971
From the moment I met you,
it's been an adventure.

17
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:57,405
Oh, yes.

18
00:00:57,611 --> 00:01:01,945
And I am deeply sorry about that.
I have nothing to say for myself...

19
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:06,552
...other than I must be
temporarily nuts right now.

20
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:11,213
Olivia. Sorry, I didn't mean to look.

21
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:14,519
- Again.
- I should probably take this.

22
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:18,059
Hello. Hi.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,074
Подржите нас и постаните VIP члан да бисте уклонили све огласе са www.OpenSubtitles.org

24
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:35,739
I can't. I can't today.

25
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:41,619
Sophie, Olivia, Amanda.

26
00:01:42,723 --> 00:01:44,247
Busy guy.

27
00:01:56,937 --> 00:01:59,929
- I think we should go into town.
- What do you mean?

28
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,801
I think you should get dressed.

29
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,070
We should take a drive, get some
lunch and get to know each other.

30
00:02:06,713 --> 00:02:08,874
Really? Why?

31
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:12,279
Because I'm running out of reasons
why we shouldn't.

32
00:02:12,486 --> 00:02:14,010
Aren't you?

33
00:02:44,985 --> 00:02:47,579
- So you're a book editor.
- Yes, I am.

34
00:02:47,788 --> 00:02:50,951
- What kind of an editor are you?
- A very mean one.

35
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:54,286
No. What I meant was,
do you give massive notes, or?

36
00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:56,122
The better the writer,
the less notes.

37
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,265
- And what'd you study in school?
- Literature.

38
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:01,934
And did you always know
this was what you wanted to do?

39
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:04,831
Okay, my palms
are starting to sweat.

40
00:03:05,038 --> 00:03:06,835
I feel like I'm on a job interview.

41
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,508
Do you, by any chance,
know how to be on a date?

42
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,178
- Sorry. I'm interrogating you.
- Yes.

43
00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:16,243
I haven't been on a first date
in a long time.

44
00:03:17,217 --> 00:03:20,448
Well, since we've already had sex
and slept together twice...

45
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:22,918
...maybe we can bend
the first-date rules.

46
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:24,754
Why are you blushing?

47
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:28,155
I didn't realize I was.
I think you make me nervous.

48
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:33,959
Okay. I'm gonna try to be myself.
It's never easy, but I'm gonna try.

49
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:37,395
What was the question? Oh, I know.

50
00:03:37,604 --> 00:03:40,129
- Did I always want to be a book editor?
- Did you...? Right.

51
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,365
The answer is yes.
My family's in publishing.

52
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:44,373
My dad's a writer
of historical fiction.

53
00:03:44,578 --> 00:03:45,977
My mum was...

54
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:49,637
Is, to this day, a very important editor
at Random House.

55
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,547
Okay. I believe my time is up.
Your turn.

56
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:55,278
Really?

57
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:56,922
- Deep breath.
- Okay.

58
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:00,157
- All right?
- Yeah.

59
00:04:00,661 --> 00:04:02,219
Well, like I said the other night...

60
00:04:02,429 --> 00:04:04,829
...I own a company
that does movie advertising.

61
00:04:05,032 --> 00:04:06,761
I didn't realize
you own the company.

62
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:08,628
Probably because
I didn't mention it.

63
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:11,861
But now that I know you were raised
by such a strong working mom...

64
00:04:12,072 --> 00:04:14,472
...I can say it,
and maybe you won't be intimidated.

65
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:16,802
No, no.
I'm still a little intimidated by it.

66
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,308
Well, "a little"
is way ahead of the curve.

67
00:04:21,214 --> 00:04:23,705
- Yeah.
- What about your family?

68
00:04:24,718 --> 00:04:26,811
Okay, I'll say it fast.

69
00:04:27,988 --> 00:04:30,149
My parents broke up when I was 15.

70
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:34,793
I'm an only child, and l...
I didn't see it coming.

71
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:36,360
You know, we were really close.

72
00:04:36,563 --> 00:04:39,930
We used to call ourselves
"The Three Musketeers."

73
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:43,699
And one night after dinner,
my parents sat me down...

74
00:04:43,904 --> 00:04:46,464
...and told me that
they were breaking up.

75
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,008
I thought they were kidding.

76
00:04:49,943 --> 00:04:54,471
And then I saw a suitcase out of
the corner of my eye in the hallway.

77
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:57,539
And my dad moved out that night.

78
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,046
I think I cried myself to sleep
for, like, well...

79
00:05:03,256 --> 00:05:05,850
Anyway, a long time.

80
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:10,189
And then I realized
that I'd better toughen up.

81
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:15,596
And, well, I got through it
and sort of haven't cried since.

82
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:19,731
I also haven't thought of
that packed suitcase maybe ever.

83
00:05:21,074 --> 00:05:22,871
And that's my tragic little story.

84
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:25,443
- Let's order.
- Wait.

85
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:27,204
You haven't cried
since you were 15?

86
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:31,316
I know it must mean something awful.
I know, but...

87
00:05:31,518 --> 00:05:34,817
You know, I try, but... Believe me.

88
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:38,014
But can we talk about you
some more, please?

89
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:42,025
Okay. Yes. Absolutely. Okay.
Well, I cry all the time.

90
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:44,356
- You do not.
- Yeah, I do.

91
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:46,293
More than any woman
you've ever met.

92
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,400
You don't have to be this nice.

93
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:50,797
- It happens to be the truth.
- Really?

94
00:05:51,004 --> 00:05:55,270
A good book, a great film,
a birthday card, I weep.

95
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:57,841
- Shut up.
- I'm a major weeper.

96
00:05:58,045 --> 00:05:59,205
I am.

97
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:58,564
- This was such a great afternoon.
- It was a really great afternoon.

98
00:06:58,772 --> 00:07:02,606
You know, you don't have
to walk me in. It's freezing, and...

99
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:05,344
You can just say
you don't want me to come in.

100
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:08,105
No, it's not that. I just... No...

101
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:11,512
I'm just tired.
I think I'm gonna take a nap.

102
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:14,084
- It's not that.
- Okay, I'll pretend I believe you.

103
00:07:15,155 --> 00:07:18,716
Graham, I'm leaving in nine days.

104
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:21,485
And that makes this complicated.

105
00:07:21,695 --> 00:07:24,858
And I'm not sure I can handle
complicated right now.

106
00:07:28,568 --> 00:07:30,126
Okay.

107
00:07:41,648 --> 00:07:44,446
And that doesn't make things
complicated?

108
00:07:44,985 --> 00:07:47,351
Sex makes everything complicated.

109
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:51,547
Even when you don't have it, the not
having it makes things complicated.

110
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:55,421
Which is why it's usually better
to have it. Some say.

111
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,065
Well, I'm off to work in the morning.

112
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,603
I promise I won't be drunkenly
banging on your door any time soon.

113
00:08:07,707 --> 00:08:10,642
We'll see each other, okay?
We'll figure something out.

114
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:13,135
- Good.
- Good.

115
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,418
Oh, it's freezing.

116
00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:46,068
- Hi.
- Hello.

117
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,804
- Bad timing?
- No, no. Come in.

118
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:52,178
- How's it going?
- Good. Yeah, everything's good.

119
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:53,875
This FedEx was leaning
on the gate.

120
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:56,817
From a little town
called London, England.

121
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:03,528
Friend of mine's writing a book,
and I give him...

122
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:07,925
...notes sometimes.

123
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,101
- You have company?
- I'm having a little Hanukkah party.

124
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:17,042
Did you join a temple
since I last saw you?

125
00:09:17,844 --> 00:09:20,472
No. My neighbor knew
I didn't know anyone here.

126
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,148
So he wanted to introduce me
to some of his friends.

127
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,818
And somehow it turned into
a Hanukkah thing.

128
00:09:26,286 --> 00:09:27,878
Do you wanna come in for a sec?

129
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:31,785
All right. Yeah.
I could play spin the dreidel.

130
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:33,519
Smells good.

131
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:37,026
I just have to say, this is one of
the best Hanukkahs I've ever had.

132
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,527
Hear, hear.

133
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:42,224
I've had too much of the Manischewitz.
I'm gonna have to be cut off.

134
00:09:42,435 --> 00:09:45,029
We are cutting you off.

135
00:09:45,238 --> 00:09:47,968
I take this very seriously,
and I'm telling you the truth.

136
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:50,165
He amazes me.

137
00:09:50,377 --> 00:09:52,106
Don't listen to them. They're nuts.

138
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:56,112
Okay, so you're telling me
you were not a ladies' man?

139
00:09:56,316 --> 00:09:58,807
Never. I married very young.

140
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:01,249
Yes, only because
he had the greatest girl in town.

141
00:10:01,454 --> 00:10:03,354
He had to take her off the market.

142
00:10:03,556 --> 00:10:07,014
- That's the truth.
- Everyone loved Marion.

143
00:10:07,227 --> 00:10:08,854
She had the greatest laugh.

144
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:11,887
What did he say?
She had the greatest ass?

145
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:14,699
Greatest laugh.

146
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:17,995
Although her ass
wasn't so bad, either.

147
00:10:19,372 --> 00:10:23,172
She had real gumption.
She was the girl I always wrote.

148
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:28,603
What about you, Miles?
You're a man about town, I presume.

149
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:33,445
No, gents, sadly I am not. I'm just
a one-woman-at-a-time kind of guy.

150
00:10:34,788 --> 00:10:39,248
Actually, I've been dating a beautiful
actress for about five months.

151
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:43,225
I do not know what she sees in me,
but I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

152
00:10:43,763 --> 00:10:46,231
Oh, she's an actress?
What's she been in?

153
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:49,368
- Anything we would have seen?
- She hasn't done that much yet, but...

154
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:51,093
And where is she tonight?

155
00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:54,232
Look, he's half-dead,
and he's still interested.

156
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:59,140
Well, I mean, that made me curious.
You know, he's here. Where is she?

157
00:10:59,346 --> 00:11:04,045
She's on location in New Mexico.
She's working on a little indie film.

158
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,050
Sorry she couldn't be here.
She'll be back in about 10 days.

159
00:11:08,254 --> 00:11:09,881
Her loss is our gain.

160
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,453
- Thank you, Arthur.
- Fellas...

161
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:16,652
...I think we should leave these young
folks and get back to our bedpans.

162
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:21,325
Okay, Norman,
you are calling me for pinochle.

163
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:24,560
- I got your cell, I'll be in touch.
- Okay, pound right here.

164
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:32,377
This was an amazing night.

165
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:35,446
Arthur Abbott is maybe the last
of the great Hollywood writers...

166
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:37,047
...from that generation. Thanks.

167
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,185
There are, like, famous things we say
because he wrote them.

168
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:43,481
I know. He told me
that his friends wrote Casablanca...

169
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,490
...but that he added the "kid"
to "Here's looking at you, kid."

170
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:50,288
Hello! Which totally makes the line.

171
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:53,295
"Here's looking at you, llsa."

172
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,263
Doesn't quite have that ring.

173
00:11:55,468 --> 00:11:59,871
He's so modest. He gave me this long
list of old movies he said I had to see.

174
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:01,631
None were written by him,
of course.

175
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:04,469
I saw a couple today.
They were fantastic.

176
00:12:04,677 --> 00:12:06,304
Maybe we can see one together.

177
00:12:06,513 --> 00:12:09,505
- That would be great.
- All right, cool.

178
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,380
Then I'll definitely call you.

179
00:12:13,586 --> 00:12:17,317
The brisket was great. And those
chocolate-covered macaroons.

180
00:12:17,524 --> 00:12:20,823
Delectable. It was really fun
hanging with you.

181
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:24,257
Okay. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to kiss you twice...

182
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:26,625
...and then linger a long time
on the second kiss.

183
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,233
- No problem.
- Oh, boy.

184
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:34,063
It is officially crazy weather.

185
00:12:39,712 --> 00:12:40,906
Don't blow away.

186
00:12:58,898 --> 00:13:01,628
"I'm not sure
I can handle complicated"?

187
00:13:01,835 --> 00:13:03,996
Oh, God, I can be such a jerk.

188
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:07,435
- Amanda Woods.
- Shut up.

189
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,973
She pushed every guy away,
every time.

190
00:13:11,177 --> 00:13:15,045
It' not, "Will she ever change,"
but, "Does she want to?"

191
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:56,613
- Surprise.
- Yeah, it is. Hi.

192
00:13:56,823 --> 00:14:00,281
Hi. So I was home doing nothing
and thinking of you...

193
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:03,519
...and I realized that a little
complication never hurt anyone.

194
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,699
And then I thought,
maybe this isn't so complicated at all.

195
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,629
And also, I wanted to apologize.

196
00:14:08,835 --> 00:14:11,360
I am sorry I didn't
invite you in this afternoon.

197
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:13,664
I don't know what that
was about exactly...

198
00:14:13,873 --> 00:14:18,572
...but whatever it was,
I thought that I should just...

199
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,611
Oh, my God. You're,
you're not alone, are you?

200
00:14:25,285 --> 00:14:26,479
No, I'm not, actually.

201
00:14:27,987 --> 00:14:29,614
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, no, no. Don't be.

202
00:14:29,822 --> 00:14:32,450
I shouldn't have just...
Oh, man.

203
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:35,651
Okay, seriously,
do not worry about this.

204
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:38,956
This is just me, like, being stupid.

205
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:42,462
Who is it, Daddy?

206
00:14:44,404 --> 00:14:46,634
- "Daddy"?
- Yes.

207
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:49,069
I am Daddy.

208
00:14:50,877 --> 00:14:53,345
Amanda, this is my
daughter Sophie.

209
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:55,013
Soph, this is my friend Amanda.

210
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:57,775
- Hi.
- How do you do?

211
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:04,114
I'm fine, thank you. How are you?

212
00:15:04,657 --> 00:15:06,887
Very well, thank you.
Do you want to come in?

213
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:08,526
Oh, no, I just...

214
00:15:09,295 --> 00:15:10,319
Hi.

215
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,324
Come here.

216
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:15,694
Daddy, who is this?

217
00:15:15,902 --> 00:15:21,033
This is Amanda. And, Amanda,
this is my youngest. Olivia.

218
00:15:26,512 --> 00:15:28,844
Sophie and Olivia.

219
00:15:29,048 --> 00:15:30,515
Dad.

220
00:15:30,717 --> 00:15:33,777
- Dad.
- Sorry, yes. Of course, come in.

221
00:15:33,987 --> 00:15:35,420
Come in.

222
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:39,681
Okay.

223
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:49,134
Daddy, can we still have
hot chocolate, please?

224
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:51,166
- Yes.
- With baby marshmallows?

225
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:52,963
Yes.

226
00:16:03,283 --> 00:16:05,251
Dad, take her coat.

227
00:16:05,952 --> 00:16:09,786
- Yes. May I, may I?
- Oh, sure. Thanks.

228
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:12,890
Are you married? Tell me fast.

229
00:16:13,092 --> 00:16:14,684
- No.
- Okay.

230
00:16:18,464 --> 00:16:20,591
I know. I'm a tad overdressed.

231
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,768
You look like my Barbie.

232
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:28,033
- Thanks.
- Is that for us?

233
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:32,969
Yes. Except for I'm sorry
about the wine.

234
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,882
I apologize for not
having mentioned this earlier.

235
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:47,082
You're D-l-V-O-R-C-E-D?

236
00:16:49,128 --> 00:16:52,791
W-l-D-O-W-E-R.

237
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:55,095
Two years ago.

238
00:16:59,238 --> 00:17:03,607
Amanda, are you by any chance
at all into hot chocolate?

239
00:17:05,845 --> 00:17:08,712
As a matter of fact, I'm...

240
00:17:09,215 --> 00:17:11,012
...totally into it.

241
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:13,977
- Here we go, Olivia. Olivia...
- Thank you.

242
00:17:14,187 --> 00:17:15,449
...blow on it. It's hot.

243
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:19,352
You too, Soph.

244
00:17:19,692 --> 00:17:21,216
She has more marshmallows
than me.

245
00:17:21,427 --> 00:17:23,327
No, she doesn't.
You each have five.

246
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,955
- You have five too.
- Thank you.

247
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:29,293
One, two, three, four, five.

248
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:36,701
What? Do I have something
on my lip?

249
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,137
Just look! There.

250
00:17:41,381 --> 00:17:43,315
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

251
00:17:43,516 --> 00:17:46,542
- Hello.
- Going up! Blow on mine.

252
00:17:48,588 --> 00:17:50,488
Thank you.

253
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,884
Excellent timing.

254
00:17:52,658 --> 00:17:55,627
Dad, do Mr. Napkin Head.

255
00:17:55,828 --> 00:17:58,319
- No. No, no, no. No Mr. Napkin Head.
- Please? Do it!

256
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:01,967
- Do it. Do it. Please.
- Do it, please. Beg you, please?

257
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:04,932
Please? Okay, I'll do it quickly.

258
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:07,766
- Oh, well, thank you for that.
- You're welcome. Now do it.

259
00:18:07,974 --> 00:18:09,498
All right.

260
00:18:10,743 --> 00:18:13,439
Amanda, can I borrow
your napkin, please?

261
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:14,874
Yes.

262
00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:16,747
Your glasses.

263
00:18:16,949 --> 00:18:18,416
Pass me those when I need them.

264
00:18:18,618 --> 00:18:20,813
Amanda, you're gonna love this.

265
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,354
It's so funny. I mean, you'll fall
off your chair, it's so funny.

266
00:18:26,459 --> 00:18:28,017
Hello.

267
00:18:30,229 --> 00:18:33,062
Hello, my name is Mr. Napkin Head.

268
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,528
- Hello, children.
- Who's this? She's a stranger?

269
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:39,102
- Amanda.
- And why has she got a funny accent?

270
00:18:39,305 --> 00:18:41,796
- Amanda.
- Yeah, but where is she from?

271
00:18:43,276 --> 00:18:46,370
Now smoke!

272
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,909
Go on.

273
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:54,952
Smoking's really bad for you.

274
00:18:57,323 --> 00:18:59,348
Amanda, guess what.

275
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:02,426
We have a tent in our playroom.
Do you want to see it?

276
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:04,619
No, no, no. Amanda...

277
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,028
...will not crawl into your tent.

278
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:11,560
You don't like tents?

279
00:19:20,947 --> 00:19:23,211
Okay, this is seriously cool.

280
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,384
Come inside.

281
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:30,452
- Lie down.
- Okay.

282
00:19:30,656 --> 00:19:33,557
Here, Amanda.
You can use my pillow.

283
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,249
- Thank you.
- Lie down!

284
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:37,258
Can you please
stop being so bossy?

285
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:40,955
- Lie down, please, next to me.
- Okay.

286
00:19:45,972 --> 00:19:48,270
Very nice.

287
00:19:48,941 --> 00:19:51,136
Excuse me.

288
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,338
This is an exceptionally great tent.

289
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,881
It's got something, hasn't it?

290
00:19:59,085 --> 00:20:02,111
- It's cozy.
- Yeah.

291
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:04,482
Who cut out
all these beautiful stars?

292
00:20:05,091 --> 00:20:07,787
- We did.
- The Three Musketeers!

293
00:20:19,205 --> 00:20:20,638
Amanda?

294
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,606
- Yes?
- You smell lovely.

295
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:25,003
Do I?

296
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:29,910
Yes. I love perfume,
but he won't let me wear it.

297
00:20:30,116 --> 00:20:32,949
Because you already smell so good.

298
00:20:33,152 --> 00:20:35,780
- So do you, by the way.
- Thanks.

299
00:20:35,988 --> 00:20:39,685
- But I'm older, so I guess I'm allowed.
- Exactly.

300
00:20:40,293 --> 00:20:42,420
I like your eye shadow.

301
00:20:42,628 --> 00:20:43,993
Thank you.

302
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,964
- And your lipstick.
- Thank you.

303
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,135
- It's new.
- What's it called?

304
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:53,931
I think it's called Berry Kiss.

305
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,734
Very Berry Kiss it is.

306
00:20:58,144 --> 00:21:00,203
Berry Kiss.

307
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:04,249
Let's see? It looks good on you.

308
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,712
Amanda?

309
00:21:07,053 --> 00:21:10,420
You know, if you wanted to sleep over,
that would be all right.

310
00:21:10,623 --> 00:21:12,147
We could push our beds together.

311
00:21:13,626 --> 00:21:15,253
Sorry.

312
00:21:16,262 --> 00:21:18,196
That's so sweet of you
to invite me...

313
00:21:18,397 --> 00:21:21,833
...but maybe another time.
Would that be all right?

314
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:23,960
Yes.

315
00:21:26,572 --> 00:21:28,437
Good girl.

316
00:21:31,877 --> 00:21:35,040
We never have grownups here
that are girls.

317
00:21:35,581 --> 00:21:36,673
I know.

318
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:39,114
I really like it.

319
00:21:39,318 --> 00:21:41,912
Me too.

320
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,205
I can't imagine anyone being
a bigger hit with my children.

321
00:22:06,112 --> 00:22:07,374
They're really great, Graham.

322
00:22:08,214 --> 00:22:11,115
Sophie's unfortunately taken
on the role as my protector.

323
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:14,582
She's brilliant, but I hate it
when she worries about me.

324
00:22:14,787 --> 00:22:16,379
And Olivia's...

325
00:22:16,589 --> 00:22:18,784
...gonna be a real ball-buster.

326
00:22:18,991 --> 00:22:21,983
Which, I must admit,
I kind of love about her.

327
00:22:22,962 --> 00:22:25,590
I'm trying to figure out
why you didn't tell me about them.

328
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:30,227
Because I just don't usually
tell women about them.

329
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:32,404
But it's just a little confusing...

330
00:22:32,605 --> 00:22:35,233
...because you're the one
who wanted to go out to lunch...

331
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:36,931
...to get to know one another.

332
00:22:37,143 --> 00:22:40,112
When you put it that way,
it sounds awful.

333
00:22:40,546 --> 00:22:44,983
I have no defense. Except that until
I get to know someone really well...

334
00:22:45,184 --> 00:22:47,550
...it's easier for me to
be a normal, single guy.

335
00:22:47,753 --> 00:22:51,689
Because it's way too complicated
to be who I really am.

336
00:22:52,224 --> 00:22:54,124
I'm a full-time dad.

337
00:22:54,326 --> 00:22:57,557
I'm a working parent.
I'm a mother and a father.

338
00:22:57,763 --> 00:23:01,859
I'm a guy who reads parenting books
and cookbooks before I go to sleep.

339
00:23:02,068 --> 00:23:05,560
I spend my weekends buying tutus.
I'm learning to sew.

340
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:07,398
I'm Mr. Napkin Head!

341
00:23:07,606 --> 00:23:11,474
I'm on some kind of
constant overload and it helps...

342
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:16,370
...to compartmentalize my life.
Just till I figure this out.

343
00:23:17,016 --> 00:23:19,746
This past weekend, the children
were with their grandparents.

344
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:23,015
And when they're gone,
I get to be somebody...

345
00:23:23,222 --> 00:23:26,385
...who doesn't have hot chocolate
spilled on his jeans.

346
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:31,025
I have no idea how to date
and be this.

347
00:23:31,464 --> 00:23:33,489
And I suppose there's...

348
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:37,167
...the possibility I'm afraid
of what another person...

349
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:39,564
...might do to who we are...

350
00:23:39,772 --> 00:23:42,206
...and how we get from
one day to the next.

351
00:23:46,912 --> 00:23:48,243
Yeah.

352
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:52,612
I guess since I am
leaving in a week, I...

353
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:55,885
I sort of get you not telling me.

354
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:59,917
- Sort of.
- I thought it would be hard...

355
00:24:00,126 --> 00:24:02,993
...to introduce them to someone
I may never see again.

356
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:10,000
Right.

357
00:24:10,503 --> 00:24:14,872
Because I'm just someone you had
sex with once and slept with twice.

358
00:24:15,074 --> 00:24:19,602
I thought I was just someone you had
sex with once and slept with twice.

359
00:24:19,812 --> 00:24:21,507
Oh, man.

360
00:24:23,249 --> 00:24:25,774
I think we just went
way past complicated.

361
00:24:25,985 --> 00:24:30,319
Right. I'm a book editor
from London. You're a...

362
00:24:31,123 --> 00:24:32,715
...beautiful...

363
00:24:32,925 --> 00:24:36,019
...movie trailer-maker from L.A.

364
00:24:36,896 --> 00:24:39,126
We're worlds apart.

365
00:24:39,932 --> 00:24:41,991
I have a cow in the back yard.

366
00:24:42,668 --> 00:24:44,431
- You have a cow?
- Yeah.

367
00:24:44,637 --> 00:24:47,299
I sew and I have a cow.

368
00:24:47,506 --> 00:24:49,974
How's that for hard to relate to?

369
00:24:54,013 --> 00:24:55,913
Pretty up there.

370
00:24:57,449 --> 00:24:59,076
Exactly.

371
00:25:12,765 --> 00:25:14,323
- Morning, Jesus.
- Good morning.

372
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:16,433
- Santa Anas?
- Oh, yeah, long time now.

373
00:25:16,635 --> 00:25:19,001
- Hi, Marta.
- Hi, Iris.

374
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:23,641
Hi there.

375
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,271
Hello!

376
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,678
Good morning.

377
00:25:28,881 --> 00:25:30,610
I counted.

378
00:25:30,816 --> 00:25:33,046
Nine movies are opening today.

379
00:25:33,252 --> 00:25:36,085
I remember when nine movies
would open in a month.

380
00:25:36,288 --> 00:25:41,851
Now a picture has to make a killing
the first weekend or they're dead.

381
00:25:42,061 --> 00:25:44,859
This is supposed to be conducive
to great work?

382
00:25:45,064 --> 00:25:48,363
Arthur, have you always
been this feisty?

383
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:51,695
Well, I may have slowed down
a little, but yes.

384
00:25:51,904 --> 00:25:54,202
You've gotta fight the fight, kid.

385
00:25:55,207 --> 00:25:56,299
Okay, your mail.

386
00:25:56,876 --> 00:26:00,039
Gas company, phone bill.

387
00:26:00,246 --> 00:26:03,807
And a letter from the
Writers Guild of America, West.

388
00:26:06,852 --> 00:26:08,786
Are you watching the movies
I recommended?

389
00:26:08,988 --> 00:26:12,947
Yes! Love them.
Irene Dunne is fantastic.

390
00:26:13,158 --> 00:26:16,423
- Gumption.
- Oh, my God, tons of it.

391
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:20,055
Arthur, don't you want to open that
letter you just threw in the bin?

392
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:22,757
No. They keep writing me
about the same thing.

393
00:26:22,968 --> 00:26:24,492
But it might be important.

394
00:26:24,703 --> 00:26:29,538
It's not. They want to arrange
some kind of tribute to me.

395
00:26:29,742 --> 00:26:31,505
A night with me.

396
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,337
I don't know. It sounds God-awful.

397
00:26:33,545 --> 00:26:36,412
What are you talking about?
That sounds brilliant!

398
00:26:36,615 --> 00:26:42,417
Would you like to walk out on a stage,
on a walker, looking 100 years old...

399
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:45,556
...and see 11 schnooks
who showed up just to see you?

400
00:26:45,758 --> 00:26:47,521
They can forget it.

401
00:26:47,726 --> 00:26:49,591
I ain't falling for this.

402
00:26:49,795 --> 00:26:53,231
So now, what's up?

403
00:26:53,632 --> 00:26:55,156
May I?

404
00:27:00,472 --> 00:27:02,440
"An Evening With Arthur Abbott."

405
00:27:04,176 --> 00:27:07,737
"Dear Mr. Abbott...... several
attempts to contact you regarding..."

406
00:27:07,947 --> 00:27:10,882
"We have not yet received
your response.

407
00:27:11,951 --> 00:27:14,419
This special night
will be a tribute to your...

408
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,681
...lifetime screenwriting achievement
and contribution to the profession.

409
00:27:18,891 --> 00:27:21,860
Congratulations on this
much-deserved honor."

410
00:27:22,528 --> 00:27:24,325
Arthur, this is a big deal.

411
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,691
You know, and they want
to do this soon.

412
00:27:27,566 --> 00:27:30,831
Listen, I reckon
that with a little bit of exercise...

413
00:27:31,036 --> 00:27:32,697
...you could walk out on your own.

414
00:27:32,905 --> 00:27:35,465
And, you know,
maybe I could go with you.

415
00:27:35,674 --> 00:27:38,768
As, like, your date or something.

416
00:27:38,978 --> 00:27:42,573
I would take you proudly,
my darling, but I'm not going.

417
00:27:43,449 --> 00:27:48,148
Anyway, how would you propose
to get me in shape? Seriously.

418
00:27:49,355 --> 00:27:50,617
Easy.

419
00:27:51,724 --> 00:27:53,885
You're doing really well.

420
00:27:54,093 --> 00:27:57,790
Nearly there. Nearly there.
Nearly there.

421
00:27:57,997 --> 00:28:01,398
Bravo! Here we go,
back the other way.

422
00:28:07,406 --> 00:28:09,431
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

423
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:12,109
- You sure?
- Yeah, I just slipped.

424
00:28:32,898 --> 00:28:35,128
- Hello?
- So are you ever coming home?

425
00:28:35,334 --> 00:28:37,529
- Oh, my God. Hi.
- How's it going?

426
00:28:37,736 --> 00:28:39,169
Great. I met a really nice guy.

427
00:28:39,371 --> 00:28:41,635
See? And you said you'd never.
What's he like?

428
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,070
He's really cute. I feel great
when I'm with him...

429
00:28:44,276 --> 00:28:48,303
...which is an entirely new experience.
And he's about 90 years old.

430
00:28:48,514 --> 00:28:50,414
- Come on.
- He' my next-door neighbor.

431
00:28:50,616 --> 00:28:53,813
Or Amanda's next-door neighbor.
By the way, you should go meet her.

432
00:28:54,486 --> 00:28:58,183
- Yeah. I have, actually.
- Oh, bugger. Call waiting.

433
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,325
Can you hold for a sec? Hold on.
I really wanna talk to you.

434
00:29:01,527 --> 00:29:03,324
- Sure.
- Hello.

435
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:06,726
- Iris, hi, it's Amanda.
- How are you? How's it going?

436
00:29:06,932 --> 00:29:09,958
- Everything's great. How are you?
- Oh, I'm loving it.

437
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:12,603
Can you hold for a sec?
My brother's on the other line.

438
00:29:12,805 --> 00:29:15,035
- Graham?
- Yes. He said you met.

439
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,607
- Yes, we did meet. How is he?
- Fine, I think.

440
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:20,472
- Can you just hold on for a sec?
- Sure.

441
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:24,308
- Okay. Hi, sorry. That was Amanda.
- How'd she sound?

442
00:29:24,516 --> 00:29:26,984
- How is she doing?
- She just asked me how you are.

443
00:29:27,186 --> 00:29:29,177
- And what did you say?
- I asked her to hold.

444
00:29:29,388 --> 00:29:32,414
- Can I call you back?
- I can hold while you speak to her.

445
00:29:32,624 --> 00:29:35,286
- Really?
- Find out how she is.

446
00:29:35,494 --> 00:29:38,156
Okay. My brother wants to know
how you are.

447
00:29:38,363 --> 00:29:42,424
Can you tell him I'm good and that
I'm just walking Charlie in the village.

448
00:29:42,634 --> 00:29:45,364
- What's he been up to? Did he say?
- I'm not sure.

449
00:29:45,571 --> 00:29:48,404
- Do you want me to ask him?
- Sure.

450
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:51,839
Okay. Hold, please.

451
00:29:52,644 --> 00:29:56,171
I can't believe that you have had sex
with the woman staying in my house!

452
00:29:57,082 --> 00:29:58,606
He told you that?

453
00:29:58,817 --> 00:30:00,717
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

454
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:04,480
Oh, my God. I thought I was talking
to Graham! Can you just hold, please?

455
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,783
I'm terribly sorry.

456
00:30:07,826 --> 00:30:09,418
I can't believe you
had sex with Amanda!

457
00:30:09,628 --> 00:30:12,529
The one thing she asked me was,
"Are there any men in your town?"

458
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:14,460
I assured her that there were not.

459
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:17,191
Then you meet her and immediately
get into her knickers!

460
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:19,761
Still me.

461
00:30:20,572 --> 00:30:22,699
Bollocks! I must have lost him.

462
00:30:22,908 --> 00:30:26,309
Amanda, I am so sorry.

463
00:30:27,312 --> 00:30:29,507
Can I call you back?

464
00:30:29,715 --> 00:30:32,809
- Sure.
- Okay, bye.

465
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:35,710
Yes, hello.

466
00:30:36,889 --> 00:30:38,754
It's Miles. Am I in trouble?

467
00:30:39,324 --> 00:30:41,792
Oh, Miles. Hi.

468
00:30:41,994 --> 00:30:43,621
What are you up to
this Christmas Eve?

469
00:30:43,829 --> 00:30:45,797
Not much. But in a little bit...

470
00:30:45,998 --> 00:30:49,263
...l'm gonna go to the video shop
and get the next movie on Arthur's list.

471
00:30:49,468 --> 00:30:51,231
Do you want some company?

472
00:30:52,738 --> 00:30:54,137
Love some.

473
00:30:55,307 --> 00:30:59,334
Hey, I got you the best drink
in town, but I didn't know...

474
00:30:59,545 --> 00:31:02,343
...if you liked a little dollop
of whipped cream or a big one...

475
00:31:02,548 --> 00:31:05,346
...so I got both and you can have
each one... Hello, big dollop!

476
00:31:05,551 --> 00:31:07,519
- Say, you look great, by the way.
- Thanks.

477
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:09,812
- Really great.
- Thanks, I'm feeling good.

478
00:31:10,022 --> 00:31:12,582
I've been working out with Arthur.

479
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:13,985
- What?
- No.

480
00:31:14,193 --> 00:31:18,186
I'm sure it's an awesome workout.
I'm sorry. I'm trying not to picture it.

481
00:31:18,397 --> 00:31:21,127
Okay, well, the workout's
not that great, but the conver...

482
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,595
Stop laughing!

483
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:26,965
- The conversation is truly fantastic.
- No, that I totally believe.

484
00:31:27,172 --> 00:31:30,835
Now let me ask you.
Have you seen this?

485
00:31:31,043 --> 00:31:33,341
Chariots of Fire. Loved it.

486
00:31:39,318 --> 00:31:41,616
Such a great score by Vangelis.

487
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,119
He took electronic scores to a new
level. It was groundbreaking.

488
00:31:45,324 --> 00:31:48,054
I'm gonna test you on this later.
Okay. Driving Miss Daisy.

489
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,559
Hans. Very unexpected.
Do you remember how great it was?

490
00:31:57,769 --> 00:31:59,634
Sassy! Love it.

491
00:31:59,838 --> 00:32:01,066
- Is this a bad game?
- No!

492
00:32:01,273 --> 00:32:02,763
- Okay.
- Keep going.

493
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:05,340
Sometimes I get self-conscious
about my...

494
00:32:08,413 --> 00:32:09,380
And:

495
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:17,686
Are you embarrassed
By this game I've started to play?

496
00:32:17,889 --> 00:32:21,188
Okay. It's not a library.
I can go loud.

497
00:32:24,062 --> 00:32:26,053
Two notes and you've got a villain.

498
00:32:27,499 --> 00:32:29,694
I don't know what to say about it.
Totally brill.

499
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:37,497
I bet you didn't know that was all
written for the movie. It was a score.

500
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:39,540
- I did know that one.
- Can't go anywhere.

501
00:32:39,745 --> 00:32:43,010
Oh, my God. Okay, this one?
You have to check this out some time.

502
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:45,410
The Mission.
The score is genius.

503
00:32:45,617 --> 00:32:48,882
It just comes from
a totally different place. It's like...

504
00:32:49,087 --> 00:32:52,784
I can't even... Just promise me
you'll rent it and listen to it.

505
00:32:52,991 --> 00:32:54,652
- Renting.
- Thank you.

506
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,849
It changed my world.

507
00:33:03,969 --> 00:33:05,459
What?

508
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:12,066
Maggie!

509
00:33:27,225 --> 00:33:31,753
- Why do I always fall for the bad girl?
- You didn't know she was a bad girl.

510
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:35,028
I knew she wasn't good.

511
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:38,495
Do you have anything
a little bit stronger?

512
00:33:39,371 --> 00:33:43,102
Thank you. Let me rephrase this:

513
00:33:45,844 --> 00:33:49,610
Why am I attracted to a person
I know isn't good?

514
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:54,383
I happen to know the answer to this.
You're hoping you're wrong.

515
00:33:54,586 --> 00:33:57,350
She does something that tells you
she's no good, you ignore it.

516
00:33:57,556 --> 00:34:00,616
Every time she comes through and
surprises you, she wins you over...

517
00:34:00,826 --> 00:34:04,455
...and you lose that argument
with yourself that she's not for you.

518
00:34:04,896 --> 00:34:05,863
Exactly.

519
00:34:07,065 --> 00:34:08,965
And on top of that,
there's the old standby:

520
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:12,193
"I can't believe a girl like that
would be with a guy like me."

521
00:34:13,105 --> 00:34:14,766
You know what she said
to me tonight?

522
00:34:15,307 --> 00:34:17,275
She finished in Santa Fe
after two days...

523
00:34:17,476 --> 00:34:19,706
...and has been staying with
whatever-his-name-was.

524
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:21,845
Which means she's been
right here in town.

525
00:34:22,314 --> 00:34:24,976
When I spoke to her this morning
on her cell and she said:

526
00:34:25,183 --> 00:34:27,310
"I'm looking out my window
and it's snowing."

527
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:30,044
She was in Santa Monica.

528
00:34:30,288 --> 00:34:32,051
What did she do,
go to Weather. Com?

529
00:34:32,257 --> 00:34:34,350
That must have made them
scream with laughter.

530
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,461
And in the meantime, I sent her
Christmas gift to Santa Fe yesterday.

531
00:34:38,663 --> 00:34:42,394
I stood in line at FedEx
to make sure she got it on time.

532
00:34:43,135 --> 00:34:45,330
Classic, right?

533
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:49,732
I don't wanna ruin your Christmas Eve.
You don't have to listen to this.

534
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:51,772
It's okay.

535
00:34:52,477 --> 00:34:53,842
I like the company.

536
00:34:58,984 --> 00:35:00,212
So how about some food?

537
00:35:00,419 --> 00:35:02,979
Shall I make us
a little Christmas fettuccine?

538
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:06,316
- Sure.
- Listen.

539
00:35:06,825 --> 00:35:10,591
I know it's hard to believe people
when they say, "I know how you feel."

540
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:14,893
But I actually know how you feel.

541
00:35:16,368 --> 00:35:18,063
You see...

542
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,369
...I was...

543
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,768
...seeing someone back in London.

544
00:35:25,177 --> 00:35:27,407
We worked for
the same newspaper.

545
00:35:27,612 --> 00:35:32,140
And then I found out that he was
also seeing this other girl, Sarah...

546
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:35,183
...from the Circulation Department
on the 19th floor.

547
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:40,023
It turned out that he wasn't
in love with me like I thought.

548
00:35:41,526 --> 00:35:44,984
What I'm trying to say is...

549
00:35:45,197 --> 00:35:48,724
...I understand feeling
as small and as insignificant...

550
00:35:48,934 --> 00:35:51,425
...as humanly possible.

551
00:35:51,636 --> 00:35:56,300
How it can actually ache in places that
you didn't know you had inside you.

552
00:35:57,609 --> 00:35:59,770
It doesn't matter how many
new haircuts you get...

553
00:35:59,978 --> 00:36:01,969
...or gyms you join...

554
00:36:02,514 --> 00:36:05,415
...or how many glasses of chardonnay
you drink with girlfriends.

555
00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:09,178
You still go to bed every night
going over every detail...

556
00:36:09,387 --> 00:36:14,950
...and wonder what you did wrong
or how you could have misunderstood.

557
00:36:16,228 --> 00:36:18,196
And how in the hell,
for that brief moment...

558
00:36:18,396 --> 00:36:20,660
...you could think that you were
that happy?

559
00:36:20,866 --> 00:36:22,891
And sometimes you can
even convince yourself...

560
00:36:23,101 --> 00:36:25,763
...that he'll see the light
and show up at your door.

561
00:36:28,874 --> 00:36:30,637
And after all that...

562
00:36:31,243 --> 00:36:34,269
...however long "all that" may be...

563
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,578
...you'll go somewhere new.

564
00:36:37,883 --> 00:36:41,546
And you'll meet people who make you
feel worthwhile again.

565
00:36:42,754 --> 00:36:46,918
And little pieces of your soul
will finally come back.

566
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,758
And all that fuzzy stuff...

567
00:36:51,062 --> 00:36:55,556
...those years of your life
that you wasted...

568
00:36:58,236 --> 00:37:01,034
...that will eventually begin to fade.

569
00:37:03,341 --> 00:37:04,308
Well, fuck.

570
00:37:05,377 --> 00:37:07,174
You need this more than I do.

571
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:13,083
That's what you're doing here?
You're getting over somebody?

572
00:37:13,285 --> 00:37:14,843
Yeah.

573
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,885
This is me in good shape.

574
00:37:17,656 --> 00:37:19,851
Is this the guy who sent you pages
from his novel?

575
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:22,052
Yeah.

576
00:37:22,861 --> 00:37:23,885
He needs me.

577
00:37:24,663 --> 00:37:26,563
So he stays in touch?

578
00:37:26,765 --> 00:37:29,131
All the time.

579
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:32,701
That makes it impossible to forget,
which is great for him, sucks for you.

580
00:37:33,905 --> 00:37:36,237
You see how great your life is
compared to mine?

581
00:37:37,576 --> 00:37:40,909
Okay, let's go.
I'm making you some fettuccine.

582
00:37:41,112 --> 00:37:44,639
It is Christmas Eve, and we
are going to sit out on that patio...

583
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:47,409
...gonna make ourselves a little fire,
pop some bubbly...

584
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:51,055
...and we are gonna celebrate
being young and being alive.

585
00:37:52,891 --> 00:37:54,756
You with me, Simpkins?

586
00:37:56,094 --> 00:37:57,823
Miles.

587
00:37:59,764 --> 00:38:02,198
You really are
an incredibly decent man.

588
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:04,432
I know.

589
00:38:04,636 --> 00:38:07,434
That's always been my problem.

590
00:39:22,747 --> 00:39:24,647
Hi.

591
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:42,765
Okay, here it is.

592
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:45,561
Arthur's theme.
I think this is really good.

593
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:46,930
- I'm serious.
- No, I know.

594
00:39:47,138 --> 00:39:49,698
I'm making him a CD of this tune.
Every time he hears it...

595
00:39:49,908 --> 00:39:52,570
...it should give him the confidence
to walk right out there.

596
00:39:52,777 --> 00:39:53,903
- Okay?
- Yep.

597
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,773
Here we go.

598
00:39:59,384 --> 00:40:01,284
Did I steal this?

599
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,914
- John Williams.
- I didn't write it, that's why.

600
00:40:05,123 --> 00:40:06,556
- Okay, this is it for real.
- Okay.

601
00:40:06,758 --> 00:40:08,316
- Here we go.
- Yep.

602
00:40:09,427 --> 00:40:11,895
A little Arthur and the knights.

603
00:40:16,434 --> 00:40:18,402
Right? It's cheeky.

604
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:21,904
It sounds like him.

605
00:40:26,144 --> 00:40:27,873
I also wrote one
that sounds like you.

606
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:31,482
You did?

607
00:40:33,852 --> 00:40:36,946
Iris, if you were a melody.

608
00:40:42,961 --> 00:40:45,555
I used only the good notes.

609
00:40:58,343 --> 00:41:01,972
Iris lives next door

610
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:07,550
To Arthur
He' a doodle-ee-doo

611
00:41:07,752 --> 00:41:10,186
- And also a doodle-ee-doo
- Scroodle-ee-doo

612
00:41:10,388 --> 00:41:12,879
- A scroodle-ee-doo? I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

613
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:14,752
- And froodle-ee-doo
- And froodle-ee-doo

614
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:16,654
We both said "froodle-ee."

615
00:41:16,861 --> 00:41:18,328
I'm impressed.

616
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:19,724
You are a prodigy.

617
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:21,159
A "doodle" prodigy.

618
00:41:21,366 --> 00:41:22,958
Swoodle-ee-doo

619
00:41:36,948 --> 00:41:40,111
So you're totally great.

620
00:41:42,787 --> 00:41:44,414
Yeah.

621
00:41:44,622 --> 00:41:45,953
This is a bitch.

622
00:41:48,593 --> 00:41:51,960
Well, you must come to London
all the time for work, right?

623
00:41:52,163 --> 00:41:53,892
London?

624
00:41:54,299 --> 00:41:55,789
Never.

625
00:41:56,768 --> 00:41:58,360
New York?

626
00:41:59,337 --> 00:42:02,067
Not really, but that's easier.
Do you go there often?

627
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,367
Rarely.

628
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:06,743
Long-distance relationships
can work.

629
00:42:07,345 --> 00:42:09,006
Really? I can't make one work...

630
00:42:09,214 --> 00:42:11,182
...when I live in the same house
with someone.

631
00:42:11,382 --> 00:42:13,976
So this could be
a good solution for you.

632
00:42:16,788 --> 00:42:18,779
Oh, man.

633
00:42:21,526 --> 00:42:23,153
Okay.

634
00:42:23,895 --> 00:42:25,419
Let's say we just make this happen.

635
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,996
We commit to flying back and forth
as much as we can.

636
00:42:28,466 --> 00:42:30,434
Yes! It's doable, definitely.

637
00:42:30,635 --> 00:42:33,968
And then let's say
in six months we hit a wall.

638
00:42:34,172 --> 00:42:36,606
Like, I can't constantly
be away from work...

639
00:42:36,808 --> 00:42:39,299
...or the girls can't deal with you
leaving so often.

640
00:42:39,677 --> 00:42:42,612
And we start to feel the tension.
We know this isn't gonna work...

641
00:42:42,814 --> 00:42:45,977
...so we start fighting because
we don't know what else to do.

642
00:42:46,184 --> 00:42:48,277
And then, after a long, tearful...

643
00:42:48,486 --> 00:42:50,215
At your end... . Phone call...

644
00:42:50,421 --> 00:42:52,514
...we just... We say goodbye.
- Thank you.

645
00:42:52,724 --> 00:42:55,955
That'll be it, for real. It's not like
we'll ever bump into each other.

646
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,993
And then what's left?
Two miserable people...

647
00:42:59,197 --> 00:43:01,688
...feeling totally mashed up
and hurt.

648
00:43:09,207 --> 00:43:10,868
Or...

649
00:43:11,442 --> 00:43:13,171
Thank you.

650
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:18,515
Or maybe we should just...

651
00:43:18,716 --> 00:43:22,550
...realize that what we've had these
past few weeks has been perfect.

652
00:43:23,321 --> 00:43:25,414
And maybe it won't
get any better than this.

653
00:43:25,623 --> 00:43:27,716
Maybe we're trying to figure
this thing out...

654
00:43:27,926 --> 00:43:29,894
...because it makes us
feel good to feel this.

655
00:43:30,094 --> 00:43:32,062
Maybe the fact
that I'm leaving in 8 hours...

656
00:43:32,263 --> 00:43:36,199
...makes this far more exciting
than it might actually be.

657
00:43:37,468 --> 00:43:38,867
Maybe.

658
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:42,164
You are, seriously,
the most depressing girl I've ever met.

659
00:43:43,408 --> 00:43:45,239
I know.

660
00:43:47,645 --> 00:43:49,636
I have another scenario for you.

661
00:43:49,847 --> 00:43:52,338
- Good.
- I'm in love with you.

662
00:43:58,156 --> 00:44:00,647
I apologize for the blunt delivery.

663
00:44:01,259 --> 00:44:04,160
But as problematical as this...

664
00:44:04,362 --> 00:44:07,354
...fact may be, I am in love.

665
00:44:08,266 --> 00:44:09,233
With you.

666
00:44:10,935 --> 00:44:12,869
I'm not feeling this
because you're leaving.

667
00:44:13,071 --> 00:44:15,096
And not because it feels good
to feel this way.

668
00:44:15,306 --> 00:44:19,174
Which, by the way, it does...
Or did, before you went off like that.

669
00:44:19,377 --> 00:44:21,538
I can't figure out
the mathematics of this.

670
00:44:21,746 --> 00:44:24,738
I just know I love you.

671
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:27,611
Can't believe how many times
I'm saying it.

672
00:44:27,819 --> 00:44:31,311
And I never thought I'd feel this way
again, so that's pretty phenomenal.

673
00:44:31,689 --> 00:44:35,489
And I realize I come
with a package deal:

674
00:44:35,693 --> 00:44:38,321
Three for the price of one. And my...

675
00:44:38,696 --> 00:44:42,154
...package, perhaps in the light of day,
isn't all that wonderful...

676
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:47,464
...but I finally know what I want,
and that, in itself, is a miracle.

677
00:44:49,007 --> 00:44:51,066
And what I want...

678
00:44:51,743 --> 00:44:53,233
...is you.

679
00:45:03,454 --> 00:45:05,945
I wasn't expecting "I love you."

680
00:45:13,431 --> 00:45:16,025
Can you not look at me like that?

681
00:45:16,234 --> 00:45:18,828
I'm trying to find
the right thing to say.

682
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:25,340
I think if the obvious response...

683
00:45:25,543 --> 00:45:28,137
...doesn't immediately
come to you, we can...

684
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,904
...just...

685
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:34,113
We should just...

686
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:36,047
...talk about something else.

687
00:45:36,254 --> 00:45:40,384
Like, possibly,
what a complete ass I am.

688
00:45:40,591 --> 00:45:45,494
I do recall you promising me
you wouldn't fall in love with me.

689
00:45:45,696 --> 00:45:47,027
Must pay better attention.

690
00:45:47,765 --> 00:45:49,790
I've never met a guy
who talks as much as me.

691
00:45:51,169 --> 00:45:52,534
But could you just for now...

692
00:45:53,204 --> 00:45:54,933
...be quiet?

693
00:45:55,206 --> 00:45:56,173
Please?

694
00:46:12,957 --> 00:46:15,391
How many of his movies
are on that list of his?

695
00:46:15,593 --> 00:46:17,220
About 15. I love it.

696
00:46:17,428 --> 00:46:20,226
I don't know how I've never seen
The Lady Eve before.

697
00:46:20,431 --> 00:46:22,092
Barbara Stanwyck is dazzling.

698
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,133
- And she's so sure of herself.
- And sexy.

699
00:46:25,336 --> 00:46:27,827
Really sexy! You know,
every movie he's told me to see...

700
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:30,837
...has this powerhouse woman in it.
- Wonder if he's trying...

701
00:46:31,042 --> 00:46:35,843
...to tell you something with that.
Okay, sorry about that. Boob graze.

702
00:46:37,315 --> 00:46:40,512
That was accidental.
Accidental boob graze.

703
00:46:43,154 --> 00:46:44,883
I'm sorry.

704
00:46:46,257 --> 00:46:48,555
- Changing subject.
- Okay.

705
00:46:48,759 --> 00:46:51,319
Arthur has requested...

706
00:46:51,529 --> 00:46:54,589
...that you write some lyrics
for his theme song.

707
00:46:54,799 --> 00:46:56,528
What's the matter? Who is it?

708
00:46:56,734 --> 00:46:57,723
It's Maggie.

709
00:46:59,871 --> 00:47:01,099
Hello?

710
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:04,499
Hi.

711
00:47:06,177 --> 00:47:08,270
I'm doing okay.

712
00:47:10,448 --> 00:47:14,384
Actually, Maggie,
I'm a bit tied up at the moment.

713
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,713
I don't know.
What time could you be there?

714
00:47:20,358 --> 00:47:22,223
All right, I'll be there.

715
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:24,724
Oh, no, no. Like, a half-hour.

716
00:47:25,663 --> 00:47:27,722
Maybe a little longer.

717
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:30,826
Okay, bye.

718
00:47:34,872 --> 00:47:36,499
She misses me.

719
00:47:36,707 --> 00:47:40,473
You see? She came to her senses.

720
00:47:45,016 --> 00:47:46,608
- We should get the bill.
- No!

721
00:47:46,817 --> 00:47:49,251
No, no, take your time.
I can wait till you're finished.

722
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:50,420
- I'm finished.
- No.

723
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:54,352
- You didn't get to your spicy tuna yet.
- I'm fine, really.

724
00:47:55,193 --> 00:47:57,718
You can go. I can get this one.

725
00:47:58,229 --> 00:48:01,790
I'll see you later at the Writers Guild.
I mean, if you can still make it.

726
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:05,400
I gotta get all the way to Silver Lake,
but I'm gonna try to be there.

727
00:48:06,404 --> 00:48:09,305
Anyway, I'm bringing the music.
I mean, I really wanna be there...

728
00:48:09,507 --> 00:48:11,771
...but I don't know how long
this is gonna take.

729
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:13,341
I'm sorry.

730
00:48:14,879 --> 00:48:17,143
It's all good. Don't worry.

731
00:48:21,018 --> 00:48:23,179
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

732
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:15,936
Hello.

733
00:49:17,241 --> 00:49:21,234
Oh, Jasper! I'm just reading
your pages.

734
00:49:21,879 --> 00:49:25,747
No, I hadn't forgotten.
I've just been busy, that's all.

735
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:29,877
That's not true. I was gonna call you
when I'd read...

736
00:49:30,288 --> 00:49:31,915
What kind of surprise?

737
00:49:32,123 --> 00:49:33,647
No, I don't see a box or anything.

738
00:49:33,858 --> 00:49:35,849
Yes, I'm sure.

739
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,756
Hold on, let me just check
the kitchen.

740
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:43,257
No, not in there.

741
00:49:43,467 --> 00:49:45,025
Well, I'll go and check the gate.

742
00:49:45,236 --> 00:49:48,899
Yes. Well, when did you send it?

743
00:49:52,376 --> 00:49:54,571
I found your Christmas present.

744
00:50:04,322 --> 00:50:05,482
This place suits you.

745
00:50:06,123 --> 00:50:07,454
Yeah, right.

746
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:10,423
No, really.

747
00:50:15,866 --> 00:50:18,801
So you are eventually
gonna look at me, aren't you?

748
00:50:25,142 --> 00:50:26,439
Hello.

749
00:50:29,146 --> 00:50:32,343
I came here
because I had to see you.

750
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:34,245
Had to.

751
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:39,051
Oh, Jasper, I really don't
understand this.

752
00:50:39,256 --> 00:50:40,848
I mean...

753
00:50:41,058 --> 00:50:45,290
I was right there for three years!
Remember? Square peg, round hole?

754
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:47,492
- What?
- That's what you said.

755
00:50:47,698 --> 00:50:49,689
That we weren't really right
for each other.

756
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,460
We were a square peg
and a round hole.

757
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:55,400
I don't remember that. I just know
I hated when you were gone.

758
00:50:55,606 --> 00:50:58,097
And also, I have never checked
my e-mails more.

759
00:50:58,309 --> 00:51:01,369
It was driving me crazy
that I wasn't hearing from you.

760
00:51:02,413 --> 00:51:04,643
I don't want to lose you, babe.

761
00:51:07,618 --> 00:51:08,812
Lose me?

762
00:51:11,489 --> 00:51:14,322
This is too confusing.

763
00:51:17,328 --> 00:51:18,852
Come here.

764
00:51:21,766 --> 00:51:25,167
I screwed up.
Miles, haven't you ever screwed up?

765
00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:27,599
I made a mistake.

766
00:51:28,572 --> 00:51:30,972
I was stupid and impulsive.

767
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:34,440
He wasn't what I thought.
I just started thinking about you...

768
00:51:34,645 --> 00:51:37,705
...and wishing and hoping
that you would just forgive me.

769
00:51:38,416 --> 00:51:40,577
Will you, Miles?

770
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:42,785
Will you forgive me?

771
00:51:57,601 --> 00:51:59,660
You know what I was thinking?

772
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,167
When you get back to London...

773
00:52:01,372 --> 00:52:04,170
...maybe we could sneak off
somewhere together.

774
00:52:04,375 --> 00:52:06,138
Maybe Venice.

775
00:52:06,343 --> 00:52:07,935
You and me in Venice
could be good.

776
00:52:09,947 --> 00:52:12,279
Do you mean that? I mean...

777
00:52:12,917 --> 00:52:14,851
Are you free to do that?

778
00:52:16,086 --> 00:52:17,553
Darling...

779
00:52:17,755 --> 00:52:21,691
...l've just traveled halfway across
the world to see you, haven't I?

780
00:52:27,331 --> 00:52:31,392
Yeah, that doesn't exactly
answer my question, so...

781
00:52:31,602 --> 00:52:35,732
Are you not with
Sarah anymore? I mean...

782
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,272
...is that what you've come here
to tell me?

783
00:52:39,376 --> 00:52:43,107
I wish you could just accept knowing
how confused I am about all this.

784
00:52:45,182 --> 00:52:48,117
Okay, let me translate that.

785
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:51,755
So you are still engaged
to be married.

786
00:52:53,924 --> 00:52:57,758
- Yes, but, I mean...
- Oh, my God.

787
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,928
Okay, this was a really...

788
00:53:02,132 --> 00:53:03,224
...close call.

789
00:53:03,434 --> 00:53:05,959
You know, I never thought
I'd say this, literally never...

790
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:09,230
...but I think you were
absolutely right about us.

791
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,567
Very square peg, very round hole!

792
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:15,575
- You cannot mean that.
- The great thing is I actually do.

793
00:53:15,779 --> 00:53:18,077
And I'm about three years late
in telling you this...

794
00:53:18,282 --> 00:53:21,012
...but nevertheless I need to say it.

795
00:53:21,385 --> 00:53:22,943
Jasper...

796
00:53:23,153 --> 00:53:24,347
Wait. I need the lights on.

797
00:53:28,826 --> 00:53:29,815
Jasper...

798
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:34,454
...you have never treated me right.

799
00:53:34,665 --> 00:53:36,189
- Ever.
- Oh, babe.

800
00:53:37,701 --> 00:53:40,192
You broke my heart.

801
00:53:40,404 --> 00:53:42,770
And you acted like
somehow it was my fault...

802
00:53:42,973 --> 00:53:45,908
...my misunderstanding,
and I was too in love with you...

803
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:49,944
...to ever be mad at you, so I just
punished myself! For years!

804
00:53:50,548 --> 00:53:54,109
But you waltzing in here
on my lovely Christmas holiday...

805
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:56,548
...and telling me that
you don't want to lose me...

806
00:53:56,754 --> 00:53:59,154
...whilst you're
about to get married...

807
00:53:59,356 --> 00:54:02,052
...somehow newly entitles me
to say...

808
00:54:04,194 --> 00:54:05,161
...it's over.

809
00:54:05,963 --> 00:54:11,367
This... This twisted,
toxic thing between us...

810
00:54:11,569 --> 00:54:13,696
...is finally finished!

811
00:54:13,904 --> 00:54:17,704
I'm miraculously done
being in love with you!

812
00:54:18,676 --> 00:54:21,144
I've got a life to start living.

813
00:54:22,813 --> 00:54:25,407
- And you're not going to be in it.
- Darling...

814
00:54:25,616 --> 00:54:27,880
Now I've got somewhere
really important to be...

815
00:54:28,085 --> 00:54:31,020
...and you have
got to get the hell out.

816
00:54:31,555 --> 00:54:33,921
- Now!
- What exactly has got into you?

817
00:54:34,825 --> 00:54:36,315
I don't know.

818
00:54:36,527 --> 00:54:40,293
But I think what I've got
is something slightly resembling...

819
00:54:40,497 --> 00:54:41,862
...gumption.

820
00:55:06,857 --> 00:55:08,586
Iris...

821
00:55:08,926 --> 00:55:11,087
...you're a knockout.

822
00:55:11,395 --> 00:55:12,692
Thank you.

823
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:16,764
- And may I say, so are you.
- Did I do my tie okay?

824
00:55:16,967 --> 00:55:20,061
I haven't worn one in 15 years.

825
00:55:21,472 --> 00:55:24,532
- It's perfect.
- I like this Hugo Boss.

826
00:55:24,742 --> 00:55:26,209
He cuts a nice suit.

827
00:55:27,244 --> 00:55:29,337
I've got something for you.

828
00:55:37,254 --> 00:55:41,657
Forgive me. The last time
I had a date, this is what we did.

829
00:55:42,393 --> 00:55:44,088
It's beautiful.

830
00:55:45,629 --> 00:55:48,962
If it's corny, or if it's
going to ruin your outfit...

831
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:51,464
...you don't have to wear it.

832
00:55:52,503 --> 00:55:54,664
I like corny.

833
00:55:55,205 --> 00:55:57,264
I'm looking for corny in my life.

834
00:55:58,208 --> 00:56:01,905
- That's a nice line.
- It's all those movies!

835
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:04,637
Okay, let's do it.

836
00:56:04,848 --> 00:56:06,975
Let's get this embarrassment
over with.

837
00:56:07,184 --> 00:56:09,084
Okay.

838
00:56:16,593 --> 00:56:18,788
- Mr. Abbott?
- Yes, sir.

839
00:56:18,996 --> 00:56:21,157
We're all ready for you.

840
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:38,170
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Arthur Abbott!

841
00:57:00,904 --> 00:57:03,896
- Oh, hi!
- Arthur, you made it.

842
00:57:05,042 --> 00:57:06,441
Thank you. Thank you too.

843
00:57:10,881 --> 00:57:11,870
Thank you very much.

844
00:57:16,553 --> 00:57:18,612
I'll take you up, Mr. Abbott.

845
00:57:20,057 --> 00:57:22,252
Go on, go for it.

846
00:57:39,543 --> 00:57:40,510
I'll do it.

847
00:57:52,756 --> 00:57:54,451
The man is a rock star.

848
00:57:55,325 --> 00:57:56,451
Hi!

849
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:02,922
Sorry I'm late. The Maggie thing
took a little time, but it is over.

850
00:58:03,133 --> 00:58:04,964
Finished, kaput.

851
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:08,128
You look beautiful.

852
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,102
Thank you.

853
00:58:11,308 --> 00:58:12,741
Thanks.

854
00:58:12,943 --> 00:58:14,706
Thank you, thank you.

855
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:16,243
I'm...

856
00:58:16,446 --> 00:58:19,813
I'm absolutely overwhelmed...

857
00:58:20,751 --> 00:58:22,275
...that I could climb those stairs.

858
00:58:23,687 --> 00:58:24,654
He did great.

859
00:58:25,422 --> 00:58:28,789
I came to Hollywood
over 60 years ago...

860
00:58:28,992 --> 00:58:31,620
...and immediately fell in love
with motion pictures.

861
00:58:32,229 --> 00:58:35,995
And it's a love affair
that's lasted a lifetime.

862
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,135
When I first arrived in Tinseltown...

863
00:58:39,336 --> 00:58:43,033
...there were no cineplexes
or multiplexes.

864
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:47,370
No such thing as a
Blockbuster or DVD.

865
00:58:47,578 --> 00:58:50,945
I was here before conglomerates
owned the studios.

866
00:58:51,648 --> 00:58:55,140
Before pictures
had special effects teams.

867
00:58:55,352 --> 00:58:58,947
And definitely before box office
results were reported...

868
00:58:59,156 --> 00:59:02,455
...like baseball scores
on the nightly news.

869
00:59:02,893 --> 00:59:05,862
He is so fantastic.

870
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:09,263
- Iris?
- Yes?

871
00:59:09,466 --> 00:59:11,957
What are you doing
New Year's Eve?

872
00:59:13,403 --> 00:59:15,303
I'll be back in England
by New Year's Eve.

873
00:59:19,009 --> 00:59:21,477
You know, I've never been
to England.

874
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:25,107
- I've never been to Europe.
- No?

875
00:59:25,616 --> 00:59:28,551
If I come over there, will you go out
with me on New Year's Eve?

876
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:34,655
Love to.

877
00:59:55,779 --> 00:59:58,748
We're not gonna make a bigger deal
out of this than it already is.

878
00:59:58,949 --> 01:00:00,314
No, we're not.

879
01:00:00,517 --> 01:00:02,985
It's not like we're never
going to speak or e-mail or...

880
01:00:03,186 --> 01:00:06,087
- No set rules.
- None.

881
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:10,622
So now I'm just gonna
kiss you for the millionth time...

882
01:00:10,827 --> 01:00:12,260
...and say, "Be seeing you."

883
01:00:28,278 --> 01:00:30,178
Be seeing you.

884
01:00:35,152 --> 01:00:37,120
Take care of yourself.

885
01:01:38,982 --> 01:01:40,916
Did you have a good holiday, miss?

886
01:01:41,752 --> 01:01:43,310
Yeah.

887
01:01:43,987 --> 01:01:45,420
Great.

888
01:01:48,191 --> 01:01:50,386
Maybe the best ever.

889
01:02:44,948 --> 01:02:46,848
Amanda Woods...

890
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:48,677
... welcome back.

891
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:52,583
Turn around!

892
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:54,987
Turn around and go back, please!

893
01:02:55,192 --> 01:02:58,753
- Did you forget something?
- Yes! Yes.

894
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:11,168
Can you go any faster?

895
01:03:11,374 --> 01:03:13,239
This lane's tricky.
It's gonna take a bit.

896
01:03:13,443 --> 01:03:14,705
It's okay, just stop.

897
01:03:21,284 --> 01:03:22,342
Madam?

898
01:03:23,386 --> 01:03:24,876
Madam!

899
01:04:20,143 --> 01:04:21,667
Graham?

900
01:04:22,846 --> 01:04:24,575
Graham.

901
01:04:37,027 --> 01:04:38,619
You know...

902
01:04:38,828 --> 01:04:41,126
...I was just thinking...

903
01:04:42,299 --> 01:04:44,665
...why would I ever leave
before New Year's Eve?

904
01:04:45,302 --> 01:04:47,793
That makes no sense at all.

905
01:04:48,004 --> 01:04:50,700
I mean, you didn't exactly
ask me out...

906
01:04:52,876 --> 01:04:55,344
...but you did say you loved me...

907
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:58,341
...so I'm thinking I've got a date.

908
01:04:58,882 --> 01:05:00,008
If you'll have me.

909
01:05:02,686 --> 01:05:04,620
I have the girls New Year's Eve.

910
01:05:07,624 --> 01:05:08,784
Sounds perfect.

911
01:05:28,278 --> 01:05:30,269
I'm coming to get you!

912
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:34,849
You look just like an angel
on the top of the Christmas tree.

913
01:05:35,051 --> 01:05:37,519
You got so big. Give us a kiss.

914
01:05:37,988 --> 01:05:40,821
Come and tell me all about
your Christmas presents.

915
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:42,655
Go sit with Miles.

916
01:05:52,435 --> 01:05:53,402
Sweetie.

917
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,175
- I challenge ye.
- Me?

918
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:55,957
The love train
is leaving the station.

919
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,875
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

920
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:15,108
Happy New Year!

921
01:07:15,318 --> 01:07:19,277
Happy New Year, everybody!

922
01:07:20,305 --> 01:08:20,905
