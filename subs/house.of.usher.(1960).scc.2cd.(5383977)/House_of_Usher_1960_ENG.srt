3
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:55,278
The House of Usher

4
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,302
- Sir?
- I should like to see Miss Usher.

5
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:49,506
I'm afraid that's not possible, sir.

6
00:02:49,992 --> 00:02:52,002
Miss Usher is confined to her bed.

7
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,164
- She is ill?
- Yes, sir.

8
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:57,410
- Is it serious?
- Sir?

9
00:02:58,301 --> 00:02:59,541
My name is Philip Winthrop.

10
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:02,136
Miss Usher and I are engaged
to be married.

11
00:03:03,565 --> 00:03:05,210
I cannot admit you, sir.

12
00:03:05,492 --> 00:03:06,345
You cannot?

13
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:10,043
- By whose order?
- Mr. Roderick, her brother.

14
00:03:10,305 --> 00:03:12,597
- He has expressly forbidden...
- Well then I should speak to him.

15
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:16,325
I insist you announce me.

16
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,363
Yes, sir. You're our guest.
Come in.

17
00:03:30,528 --> 00:03:31,894
Your coat, sir.

18
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:40,458
If you'd just follow me.

19
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:45,752
Yes? What is it?

20
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:48,274
Your boots, sir.

21
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:54,340
- What about them?
- Do you mind... taking them off?

22
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,157
Taking them off? What on earth for?

23
00:04:00,096 --> 00:04:03,133
I am sure Mr. Roderick will explain
it to you, sir.

24
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,625
A strange request.

25
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:18,839
This is the first time I've
ever been...

26
00:04:48,808 --> 00:04:49,833
Sir.

27
00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:55,871
If you'd care to put these on, sir.

28
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,093
Thank you

29
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,311
And if we may go now...

30
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:13,016
This way, sir.

31
00:05:47,886 --> 00:05:49,332
What is the meaning of this?

32
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,835
I... This is Mr. Winthrop, sir.

33
00:05:55,206 --> 00:05:56,976
How dare you admit anyone
into this house.

34
00:05:57,788 --> 00:06:00,671
I insisted, sir. I felt I had
the right.

35
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,052
Well, we can't talk out here.

36
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:06,038
Please, come in.

37
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:17,680
- I gather you know who I am.
- If you'd please...

38
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,395
Mr. Winthrop... softly.

39
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:26,138
An affliction of the hearing.

40
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:29,065
Sound of any exaggerated degree...

41
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:31,358
...cut into my brain like knives.

42
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:34,195
My apologies.

43
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:41,833
I'm afraid you are going
to leave, Mr. Winthrop.

44
00:06:43,224 --> 00:06:44,795
I've come to see Madeline.

45
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:49,443
That is quite impossible
She is confined to her bed.

46
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:54,599
Mr. Usher, your sister and I
are betrothed.

47
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:57,214
- It was a mistake.
- I don't believe that.

48
00:06:57,464 --> 00:06:58,877
Please, don't argue with me, sir.

49
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:03,285
You must leave this house now.

50
00:07:05,064 --> 00:07:07,384
It is not a healthy place for
you to be.

51
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:08,856
Mr. Usher...

52
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:16,333
I have ridden all the way
from Boston to see Madeline...

53
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,285
- ...and I do not intend to
leave without seeing her. Now, if...
- Philip!

54
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:23,713
Madeline...

55
00:07:26,388 --> 00:07:29,292
Madeline, in Heaven's name,
you must return to your bed.

56
00:07:30,963 --> 00:07:31,885
Madeline...

57
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:35,514
You came all the way just
to see me?

58
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:37,474
Yes, to see you.

59
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:39,080
Madeline, I must insist.

60
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:43,741
- We shall talk later, Philip.
- Mr. Winthrop is leaving.

61
00:07:44,994 --> 00:07:47,132
- Leaving?
- I'm not leaving.

62
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:50,815
He must stay, Roderick.

63
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:55,005
Please, let him stay,
Roderick.

64
00:07:56,766 --> 00:07:58,383
Very well, he will stay.

65
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:01,167
Now, for pity's sake,
return to your bed

66
00:08:38,047 --> 00:08:39,069
What happened?

67
00:08:41,795 --> 00:08:44,050
I think your fireplace needs
the screen.

68
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:45,492
Does it?

69
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:48,640
I was just admiring this
painting here.

70
00:08:49,438 --> 00:08:52,591
- Is it your own work?
- It is.

71
00:08:53,044 --> 00:08:55,364
And... you also play this lute.

72
00:08:57,678 --> 00:08:58,764
I do.

73
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:04,820
Mr. Winthrop, are you actually
planning to marry my sister?

74
00:09:06,485 --> 00:09:07,430
Mr. Usher...

75
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:11,108
...during the time we spent
together in Boston...

76
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,296
it never occurred to me...

77
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:14,908
And I dare say to
Madeline neither...

78
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,322
...That we were not
destined to each other.

79
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:23,377
When she left me she said to me:
"I will love you forever".

80
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:27,240
Does it seem so incredible
that I would want to marry her?

81
00:09:28,287 --> 00:09:30,623
If you only knew how incredible.

82
00:09:32,328 --> 00:09:33,921
And I suppose this vision...

83
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:37,670
...includes children?

84
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:39,168
God willing...

85
00:09:39,383 --> 00:09:40,262
God willing?

86
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:44,381
If you knew the nightmare you
are picturing for me, sir...

87
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:46,433
- Nightmare?
- That's what I said.

88
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,819
Why shouldn't Madeline marry
and have children?

89
00:09:52,797 --> 00:09:55,687
Because the Usher line
is tainted, Mr. Winthrop.

90
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,483
- Tainted, sir?
- You saw Madeline and you see me.

91
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:02,388
We are dying, Mr. Winthrop.

92
00:10:03,113 --> 00:10:06,194
As you saw her today she is
and she will remain...

93
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:13,283
Believe me, sir... I bear you
no malice.

94
00:10:14,596 --> 00:10:16,149
Were things otherwise...

95
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,075
...I should welcome to our
family joyously.

96
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:22,743
But under the circumstances it
is quite impossible.

97
00:10:23,398 --> 00:10:25,000
But why do you assume that...

98
00:10:25,544 --> 00:10:26,785
...you are dying?

99
00:10:28,014 --> 00:10:29,572
There are many reasons.

100
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:31,714
Pray, give me one then.

101
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,255
Madeline and I are like figures
of fine glass.

102
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:42,450
The slightest touch and we
may shatter.

103
00:10:44,517 --> 00:10:48,107
Both of us suffer from a morbid
acuteness of the senses.

104
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:54,013
Mine is the worst, for having existed 
along and the both of us are inflicted with it.

105
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:56,166
Any sort of food...

106
00:10:56,985 --> 00:10:59,229
...more exotic than
the most pallid mashes...

107
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:01,915
...unendurable to my
taste buds.

108
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:04,903
Any sort of garment other
than the softest...

109
00:11:05,484 --> 00:11:07,292
...is agony to my flesh.

110
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:10,463
My eyes are tormented by all...

111
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,216
but the faintest illumination.

112
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:15,931
All these assail me constantly...

113
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,691
...as I've said...

114
00:11:19,163 --> 00:11:23,567
the sounds of any degree whatsoever
inspire me with terror.

115
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,036
That's why your servant asked me
to remove my boots.

116
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:30,360
Yes. And even so I could hear you
coming.

117
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:34,184
Every footstep. Every rustle
of your clothes.

118
00:11:34,557 --> 00:11:36,902
I could hear your horse approaching.

119
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:40,023
Hear the clatter of the hoofs
across the courtyard.

120
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:41,538
Your knock!

121
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:46,017
The grating of the door bolt was
like a sword struck to my ears.

122
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:53,799
I can hear the scratch of the
rat claws within the stone wall.

123
00:11:55,238 --> 00:11:58,947
Mr. Winthrop, three quarters
of my family...

124
00:11:59,243 --> 00:12:00,726
...have fallen into madness.

125
00:12:01,644 --> 00:12:05,370
And in their madness they have
acquired a superhuman strength...

126
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,144
...so that it took the power
of many to subdue them.

127
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,331
Do you not exaggerate, sir.

128
00:12:16,242 --> 00:12:18,411
Perhaps there have been in your
family certain...

129
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,342
...peculiarities of temperament, but...

130
00:12:22,673 --> 00:12:24,448
Peculiarities of temperament?

131
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,274
How diplomatically you put it!

132
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:33,216
Peculiarities of temperament.

133
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:41,974
Would you permit me to light a candle
so that...?

134
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:43,691
I think you had better leave, Mr. Winthrop.

135
00:12:44,342 --> 00:12:47,021
I think you need some light in this
house, Mr. Usher.

136
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,757
Two pale drops of fire...

137
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:13,616
...clattering in the vast, consuming,
darkness.

138
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:18,255
My sister and myself.

139
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,833
Shortly they will burn no more.

140
00:13:24,448 --> 00:13:26,800
She cannot leave this house, Mr. Winthrop.

141
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:29,990
Believe that or not as you will, but she
cannot leave it.

142
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:35,302
For her own sake as well as yours, will you
leave now, please.

143
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,177
No, I will not.

144
00:13:41,184 --> 00:13:42,055
Very well.

145
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,832
Bristol will show you to a room.

146
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:52,784
I warned you, sir.

147
00:13:54,388 --> 00:13:57,525
Whatever consequences may follow your
refusal to leave,

148
00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:00,547
are upon you alone.

149
00:14:44,003 --> 00:14:44,766
Yes?

150
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,871
<i>Supper, Mr. Winthrop.</i>

151
00:14:47,642 --> 00:14:50,398
- I'll be down directly.
- Very good, sir.

152
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:03,623
- What is that noise?
- What happened?

153
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:07,782
- Is it Mr. Winthrop?
- Philip!.

154
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,493
- I'm all right, Madeline.
- What happened?

155
00:16:15,663 --> 00:16:18,634
- I'm not sure.
- Philip, you'd better leave this place.

156
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:21,340
Please leave! It isn't safe for you.

157
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:23,253
Darling, I'm all right.

158
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:32,739
I'm not leaving you, Madeline.

159
00:16:42,357 --> 00:16:45,225
- Mr. Winthrop?
- No, thank you.

160
00:16:46,568 --> 00:16:47,615
My dear?

161
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:55,203
You haven't touched the thing, Madeline.

162
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:02,124
Don't you think...

163
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,136
...that crack in the wall should be
repaired?

164
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:11,466
For future generations of Ushers?

165
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,501
For Madeline's safety.

166
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,457
It was probably the trembling of
the house which caused...

167
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:20,980
that chandelier to fall.

168
00:17:23,725 --> 00:17:25,128
Do you really think so?

169
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:28,260
Have you a better explanation?

170
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:39,053
While I was riding here, I noticed a
singular lack of vegetation in the area.

171
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,508
Is there something wrong with
the soil?

172
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,120
The soil?
Yes, of course.

173
00:17:47,824 --> 00:17:51,022
- Roderick, please.
- As you will.

174
00:17:54,604 --> 00:17:58,309
- How do things go in Boston, Philip?
- Everyone asks for you.

175
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:00,305
Do they?

176
00:18:01,104 --> 00:18:05,952
We miss you, Madeline.
We all miss you.

177
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:01,721
Remarkable.
And you composed it yourself?

178
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,182
Yes.

179
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:07,501
May we have another?

180
00:19:08,508 --> 00:19:10,755
I'm afraid Madeline must retire now.

181
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:12,563
But I am not tired .

182
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:19,358
Very well.

183
00:19:23,115 --> 00:19:24,106
Good night, brother.

184
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,678
Good night, my dear.

185
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:34,610
Good night, Philip.

186
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:36,622
Good night.

187
00:19:41,772 --> 00:19:44,811
I suggest we retire too, Mr. Winthrop.

188
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,574
Gladly.

189
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:51,802
I trust that you will be prepared
to leave tomorrow morning.

190
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,528
If you wish...
But if I do...

191
00:19:56,648 --> 00:19:57,987
...I won't be alone.

192
00:19:58,854 --> 00:19:59,988
I intend to see that...

193
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:39,884
- Oh, Philip
- Darling.

194
00:20:42,055 --> 00:20:43,839
I'm sorry I frightened you.

195
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:47,840
I did not want your brother to hear.

196
00:20:55,853 --> 00:20:56,956
Philip, I missed you.

197
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:04,092
I love you.

198
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:09,718
Madeline, I swear to you, tomorrow
you leave this place with me.

199
00:21:11,534 --> 00:21:14,861
- If only I could.
- You will, you will.

200
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:17,630
You don't understand.

201
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:21,473
But you've never seen the heart
of this horrible house.

202
00:21:23,302 --> 00:21:26,700
Darling, once you're with me you'll
wake up from this... this nightmare!

203
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,315
Good night, sir.

204
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:36,948
Mr. Usher, perhaps you fail to understand...

205
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:39,158
Good night, sir.

206
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:41,265
You cannot order my life, Roderick.

207
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,860
Is it so easy for you to forget, Madeline?

208
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:47,842
- My life is my own.
- Is it?

209
00:21:48,964 --> 00:21:49,174
Yes.

210
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:53,094
- I think that...
- Is it, Madeline?

211
00:21:54,503 --> 00:21:56,831
You hate me so much you want to keep
me a prisoner here?

212
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:00,392
Hate you?

213
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:04,349
Oh, my dear, hate you?

214
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:09,272
Don't you know that I love you more than
anything in the world?

215
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:13,616
Can't you see it's my love for you makes
me act as I do.

216
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:17,320
You cannot leave here, Madeline.

217
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:20,139
You know what would happen if you did,
you know that.

218
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:24,173
- I know what you've told me.
- Oh, my dear.

219
00:22:24,662 --> 00:22:28,411
Do not delude yourself, I beg of you,
do not delude yourself.

220
00:22:31,493 --> 00:22:35,912
- Sir...
- I shall stay with her.

221
00:22:36,172 --> 00:22:40,157
In the name of God, would you not
understand! Leave my sister be.

222
00:22:41,065 --> 00:22:43,303
Mr. Usher, I mean to take her from this
house tomorrow.

223
00:22:44,482 --> 00:22:47,146
I will not argue with you.
Will you leave, please?

224
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:52,397
We'll be all right, Madeline.

225
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:50,098
Madeline?

226
00:27:39,009 --> 00:27:40,097
Don't touch her!

227
00:27:41,204 --> 00:27:43,748
You mustn't wake her, sir.

228
00:27:47,977 --> 00:27:50,808
The shock could be very harmful.

229
00:27:52,703 --> 00:27:57,018
- How did she get here?
- Se walks in her sleep, sir.

230
00:27:59,154 --> 00:28:00,601
And then she comes here?

231
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:05,941
She is obsessed by thoughts of death. 
Poor child!

232
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,203
How long has she been doing this?

233
00:28:09,246 --> 00:28:11,839
Ever since her return from Boston, sir.

234
00:28:13,203 --> 00:28:15,351
I'll just take her to her room.

235
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,115
- No, I...
- No!

236
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,801
You might awaken her, sir.

237
00:28:21,126 --> 00:28:22,434
Better let me.

238
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:26,273
I've done it before.

239
00:29:01,143 --> 00:29:03,880
- Good morning, Bristol.
- Good morning, sir.

240
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,663
Has Miss Madeline had her breakfast yet?

241
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,218
Oh, no, sir.

242
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,191
Good, then I'd like to take
her breakfast straight to her.

243
00:29:11,528 --> 00:29:15,410
Very well, sir. Of course, she does not 
eat very much usually

244
00:29:16,883 --> 00:29:18,260
Well then we will see that she
does eat.

245
00:29:18,927 --> 00:29:22,958
- Yes sir...
- All right, let's see what we have here...
  bread, that's good...

246
00:29:23,296 --> 00:29:24,934
Milk? A little fruit?

247
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:27,059
Why, I'll take it to her, sir.

248
00:29:27,537 --> 00:29:30,973
- No, I'll do it.
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, how about some eggs?

249
00:29:31,614 --> 00:29:34,831
No, sir. I think perhaps a little gruel.

250
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,247
It's the most she has ever eaten
in the morning.

251
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:39,751
- Gruel?
- Yes, sir.

252
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,452
Oh, yes, her sense of taste.

253
00:29:45,324 --> 00:29:49,121
- Well, all right then, hot gruel
  ...for both of us.
- Yes, sir.

254
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,169
How long have you been with
the Ushers, Bristol?

255
00:29:58,977 --> 00:30:00,427
Sixty years, sir.

256
00:30:02,196 --> 00:30:05,853
- Sixty years?
- Ever since I was a boy.

257
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,924
Why then this is as much your house
as it is Mr. Roderick's.

258
00:30:11,671 --> 00:30:13,557
And Miss Madeline, sir.

259
00:30:15,621 --> 00:30:16,865
Not after today.

260
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:19,389
I'm taking her to Boston with me.

261
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:22,276
We'll see.

262
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:38,698
How long has that been going on?

263
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,146
So long I'm hardly aware of it any more.

264
00:30:42,442 --> 00:30:44,713
It's just the settling of the house.

265
00:30:44,965 --> 00:30:47,495
That settling can cause this entire 
structure to collapse.

266
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,505
- And that doesn't worry you?
- Oh, no, sir.

267
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:53,641
If the house dies, I shall die with it.

268
00:30:53,906 --> 00:30:56,771
Be careful, sir. It was about to hit you.

269
00:30:57,845 --> 00:30:59,431
It could cause a nasty burn.

270
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:03,388
It's that fissure that causes the 
entire house to shake.

271
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:07,086
Yes, sir.

272
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,811
Who is it?

273
00:31:25,197 --> 00:31:26,552
Your breakfast, Miss Usher.

274
00:31:27,264 --> 00:31:31,216
Hot gruel and... hot gruel.

275
00:31:34,988 --> 00:31:37,568
It's so dark in here I can barely see you.

276
00:31:40,962 --> 00:31:41,735
There.

277
00:31:43,493 --> 00:31:44,645
No sunlight.

278
00:31:46,123 --> 00:31:47,864
There'll be sunlight where we leave.

279
00:31:54,153 --> 00:31:55,145
Now... good morning.

280
00:31:58,638 --> 00:31:59,563
Good morning.

281
00:32:01,062 --> 00:32:02,901
If he comes in now don't be afraid.

282
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,958
He won't come in. He has to take drugs
to sleep

283
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:08,566
Oh, I'm sorry.

284
00:32:10,906 --> 00:32:11,822
Well now...

285
00:32:14,383 --> 00:32:17,343
We'll fill you with hot gruel in good share!

286
00:32:18,455 --> 00:32:19,781
You're so sweet to me.

287
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,420
Nothing too good for future
Mrs. Winthrop.

288
00:32:23,145 --> 00:32:26,846
- Mrs. Winthrop?
- Open your mouth.

289
00:32:29,441 --> 00:32:30,559
I'm not hungry.

290
00:32:31,135 --> 00:32:34,180
Madeline, I have no scrawny woman I my
home, now open your mouth.

291
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:35,375
Come on.

292
00:32:42,054 --> 00:32:43,677
Madeline, get ready to leave.

293
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,920
- I want to, Philip.
- Then you will.

294
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,082
- I can't.
- Why?

295
00:32:51,932 --> 00:32:54,195
Because very soon I shall be dead.

296
00:32:54,824 --> 00:32:56,976
I forbid you to say that ever again.

297
00:32:57,628 --> 00:32:59,609
- It is true, Philip.
- It is not true, Madeline.

298
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:01,304
You're full of life.

299
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:05,890
Look at me, Philip. Do I look full of life?

300
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:10,943
I remember you as you were in Boston.

301
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,152
Do you remember? You were exuberant.

302
00:33:14,478 --> 00:33:16,506
You were filled with the joy of living.

303
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:21,392
And so you'll be again when you leave
here and become my wife.

304
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:25,171
I wish you could understand.

305
00:33:25,613 --> 00:33:28,673
Let me understand, Madeline, let me
so that I can help you.

306
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,371
Perhaps you shall feel differently
after you see.

307
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:03,196
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

308
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:15,893
Careful, darling.

309
00:34:35,171 --> 00:34:37,782
- You don't want to go in there.
- I want you to see.

310
00:34:53,406 --> 00:34:54,655
Put your weight against it.

311
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,054
The all our... Ushers.

312
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:27,993
It's the lack of air in here.

313
00:35:29,265 --> 00:35:30,725
It's the air itself.

314
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,991
Nothing can survive that long.

315
00:35:41,655 --> 00:35:43,708
My great-grandfather.

316
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:49,634
His wife.

317
00:36:01,885 --> 00:36:03,538
My grandfather.

318
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,006
My grandmother.

319
00:36:26,376 --> 00:36:27,655
My father.

320
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,411
My mother.

321
00:36:53,554 --> 00:36:55,047
This is monstrous!

322
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:58,200
Whose idea was this?
Your dear brother's?

323
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,031
There is one for him too.

324
00:37:01,669 --> 00:37:03,050
Does that absolve him?

325
00:37:05,568 --> 00:37:06,845
It waits for me.

326
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,896
No, it does not.

327
00:37:11,724 --> 00:37:13,399
They all wait for me.

328
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:19,241
Madeline, Madeline,
you must stop this.

329
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:23,428
Can't you see what you are doing to yourself?

330
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:25,981
You don't understand.

331
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,478
I understand, but you must leave
the dead to themselves.

332
00:37:29,412 --> 00:37:31,009
Madeline, come away with me now.

333
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,377
What have you done?

334
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,048
Give her to me.

335
00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:31,110
- Thank you. See to the crypt, will you?
- Yes.

336
00:38:42,746 --> 00:38:44,980
Well, are you content now,
Mr. Winthrop?

337
00:38:46,586 --> 00:38:48,897
It is not I who forced her to
live in the cemetery.

338
00:38:50,547 --> 00:38:52,651
Do you think that I
wish her harm?

339
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:56,373
I think you still do not understand.

340
00:38:57,772 --> 00:38:59,781
And I think it's time that you did.

341
00:39:05,133 --> 00:39:06,504
The tarn is very deep.

342
00:39:07,664 --> 00:39:10,466
One of the Usher women drowned
herself in it.

343
00:39:10,877 --> 00:39:12,392
She was never found.

344
00:39:13,339 --> 00:39:17,098
I dare say it's deep enough
to swallow this house entire.

345
00:39:17,576 --> 00:39:19,154
I'm waiting, Mr. Usher.

346
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:22,562
Last night you asked me about the
singular aridity...

347
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:26,149
...of the land around this house.

348
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:32,750
Once this land was fertile,
farms abounded.

349
00:39:33,077 --> 00:39:35,442
Earth yielded her riches
at harvest time.

350
00:39:35,989 --> 00:39:41,063
There were trees and plant life, 
flowers. Fields of grain.

351
00:39:41,848 --> 00:39:43,579
There was great beauty here.

352
00:39:44,188 --> 00:39:47,480
At that time this water was
clear and fresh.

353
00:39:48,406 --> 00:39:51,814
Swans glided upon its crystal surface.

354
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:57,291
Animals came to its bank, 
trustingly, to drink.

355
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,361
But this was long before my time.

356
00:40:04,087 --> 00:40:05,569
Why do you tell me these things?

357
00:40:06,884 --> 00:40:10,930
And then something crept across the
land and blacked it.

358
00:40:12,356 --> 00:40:14,987
The trees lost their foliage.

359
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,693
The flowers languished and died.

360
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:22,178
Shrubs grew brown and shrivelled.

361
00:40:27,295 --> 00:40:31,550
And the lakes and ponds became black
and stagnant.

362
00:40:33,113 --> 00:40:36,215
And the land withered as
before a plague.

363
00:40:38,108 --> 00:40:39,069
A plague?

364
00:40:40,991 --> 00:40:45,974
Yes, Mr. Winthrop, a plague of evil.

365
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:50,952
Anthony Usher,
thief, usurer...

366
00:40:53,468 --> 00:40:55,369
...merchant of flesh...

367
00:40:58,071 --> 00:41:04,282
Bernard Usher. Swindler, forger.

368
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:07,487
Jewel thief. Drug addict.

369
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:14,909
Francis Usher...
professional assassin.

370
00:41:18,834 --> 00:41:21,546
Vivian Usher. Blackmailer...

371
00:41:22,985 --> 00:41:25,194
...harlot, murderess.

372
00:41:26,598 --> 00:41:28,588
She died in a madhouse.

373
00:41:31,247 --> 00:41:32,952
Captain David Usher...

374
00:41:33,501 --> 00:41:38,477
...smuggler, slave trader...
mass murderer.

375
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,114
Mr. Usher, I don't see that this has
anything to do with Madeline and myself.

376
00:41:45,523 --> 00:41:47,775
I don't believe in the sins
of the fathers being...

377
00:41:48,044 --> 00:41:49,426
...visited upon the children.

378
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:55,832
You do not, Sir?

379
00:41:57,433 --> 00:42:00,214
The house of Usher seems to
you, then, normal?

380
00:42:01,774 --> 00:42:04,738
The house, Sir, is neither normal
nor abnormal.

381
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:07,549
It's only a house.

382
00:42:07,793 --> 00:42:09,658
You are very wrong, Mr. Winthrop.

383
00:42:10,482 --> 00:42:13,521
This house is centuries old.
It was brought here from England.

384
00:42:13,818 --> 00:42:17,158
And with it every evil
rooted in its stones.

385
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:19,216
You really believe this?

386
00:42:21,698 --> 00:42:23,623
Evil is not just a word.

387
00:42:24,558 --> 00:42:27,582
It is reality. Like any living thing...

388
00:42:27,903 --> 00:42:31,237
...it can be created and was created
by these people.

389
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,189
The history of the Ushers...

390
00:42:37,494 --> 00:42:39,439
...is a history of
savage degradations.

391
00:42:40,415 --> 00:42:42,432
First in England, and then in
New England.

392
00:42:44,253 --> 00:42:46,490
And always in this house.

393
00:42:47,905 --> 00:42:49,814
Always in this house.

394
00:42:50,477 --> 00:42:53,425
Born of evil which feels,
it is no illusion.

395
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:57,260
For hundreds of years,
foul thoughts...

396
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,963
...and foul deeds have been
committed within its walls.

397
00:43:00,868 --> 00:43:03,147
The house itself is evil now.

398
00:43:04,901 --> 00:43:07,497
No, I... I cannot believe this.

399
00:43:07,682 --> 00:43:08,772
But you must.

400
00:43:09,411 --> 00:43:11,762
For Madeline's sake, you must.

401
00:43:12,595 --> 00:43:15,310
Most of all, does this evil
reside in her.

402
00:43:16,683 --> 00:43:18,515
And this is your dreadful secret?

403
00:43:20,103 --> 00:43:21,210
Mr. Winthrop...

404
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,283
Do you think those coals jumping
from the fire out to you...

405
00:43:25,473 --> 00:43:26,797
...were an accident?

406
00:43:27,348 --> 00:43:30,352
Do you think that chandelier
falling was an accident?

407
00:43:31,133 --> 00:43:33,850
Do you think that falling casket
was an accident?

408
00:43:33,884 --> 00:43:37,067
- Are you trying to tell me that
the house made those things happen?
- Yes.

409
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:44,285
No, Sir, that's ridiculous,
but even if it were true...

410
00:43:44,841 --> 00:43:46,652
...even if this house were
full of evil...

411
00:43:47,894 --> 00:43:49,394
Madeline is not.

412
00:43:49,798 --> 00:43:52,512
Not for all of your talk are you.

413
00:43:52,877 --> 00:43:55,586
You cannot take my sister
out of this house.

414
00:43:56,527 --> 00:43:58,419
If she were to wed and bear children...

415
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:01,672
...the Usher evil would spread
and you, malignant cancer ...

416
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,230
- You are mad, I will not listen to you.
- She will.

417
00:44:04,386 --> 00:44:05,288
No, I will not!

418
00:44:06,837 --> 00:44:09,313
I'll tell you what's evil in
this house, Sir. You!

419
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:11,455
I will not let your sicken fancies...

420
00:44:11,808 --> 00:44:13,789
...destroy Madeline's life.

421
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:19,720
She leaves with me today.

422
00:44:29,607 --> 00:44:30,967
Who is it?

423
00:44:33,226 --> 00:44:35,207
We're leaving. Now.

424
00:44:36,676 --> 00:44:38,203
Madeline, you have no other choice.

425
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,032
If you remain here, this
house will destroy you.

426
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,447
Then, you know.

427
00:44:45,238 --> 00:44:47,516
I know that your brother's poisoned
you with his absurdities.

428
00:44:48,389 --> 00:44:52,266
This entire atmosphere of sickness
and disillusion is his doing.

429
00:44:56,135 --> 00:44:59,172
Oh Madeline, believe me, there's nothing
wrong with you that...

430
00:44:59,395 --> 00:45:00,755
...leaving this house won't cure.

431
00:45:01,612 --> 00:45:02,976
Do you love me?

432
00:45:06,863 --> 00:45:08,999
- You know I do.
- Then leave with me now.

433
00:45:11,563 --> 00:45:13,426
I will.

434
00:45:20,334 --> 00:45:23,283
Well, pack just a few belongings.
I'll get my things ready.

435
00:45:23,825 --> 00:45:25,785
- How we go?
- You'll ride with me.

436
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:28,261
Later on we get coach to Boston.

437
00:45:29,361 --> 00:45:31,342
Oh, Philip, can it truly be?

438
00:45:31,712 --> 00:45:34,973
Darling, within an hour, within
an hour we'll be away form here.

439
00:45:37,676 --> 00:45:39,393
I love you.

440
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:42,024
I love you.

441
00:45:43,096 --> 00:45:45,232
Pack, quickly!

442
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:06,837
<i>No, I will not let it happen
any longer.</i>

443
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:09,214
<i>Now please let me go.
I don't care what you say!</i>

444
00:46:09,781 --> 00:46:11,037
<i>You can't keep me.</i>

445
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:15,642
<i>- And I will go.</i>

446
00:46:15,874 --> 00:46:20,857
<i>No, I will not let you. 
Please let me go.</i>

447
00:46:21,716 --> 00:46:23,267
<i>- I say I will!
- Madeline!</i>

448
00:46:24,103 --> 00:46:26,447
<i>I must leave, Roderick.
Please let me.</i>

449
00:46:26,681 --> 00:46:27,650
Madeline!

450
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:29,590
<i>I don't care what you say.</i>

451
00:46:30,002 --> 00:46:32,539
<i>- There's nothing you can say
to me, Roderick.
- Madeline, open the door.</i>

452
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,573
What have you done to her?

453
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:54,719
Madeline?

454
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:58,207
Madeline?

455
00:47:12,949 --> 00:47:14,336
No...

456
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,478
No...

457
00:47:40,877 --> 00:47:42,578
Yes, she is dead.

458
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,653
I told you she could never
leave this house.

459
00:47:46,467 --> 00:47:48,633
- What did you do to her?
- I didn't touch her.

460
00:47:49,608 --> 00:47:50,929
You killed her!

461
00:47:51,726 --> 00:47:56,302
There's no mark on her. You are
the one who killed her.

462
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,920
I told you she was not well,
and yet you persisted.

463
00:48:04,188 --> 00:48:06,902
Her heart cannot withstand the
strain you put upon her.

464
00:48:12,494 --> 00:48:14,012
That's no matter now.

465
00:48:15,355 --> 00:48:19,262
At least she has been spared the
agony of trying to escape.

466
00:48:38,024 --> 00:48:39,975
One candle left to burn now...

467
00:48:47,439 --> 00:48:50,118
...before the darkness comes.

468
00:49:16,818 --> 00:49:17,877
At least...

469
00:49:19,425 --> 00:49:22,495
...she has found peace now.

470
00:49:23,131 --> 00:49:24,273
Has she?

471
00:49:26,148 --> 00:49:27,541
Why do you say that?

472
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,747
Because I do not believe that
for the Ushers...

473
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:34,217
...there is peace hereafter.

474
00:49:34,535 --> 00:49:36,817
Is there no end to your horrors?

475
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,201
No, non whatever.

476
00:49:43,002 --> 00:49:44,785
For they are not mine alone.

477
00:49:45,155 --> 00:49:48,542
Mere passage from the flesh cannot
undo centuries of evil.

478
00:49:50,047 --> 00:49:52,312
There can be no peace without penalty.

479
00:49:54,126 --> 00:49:56,065
Then you wanted her to die.

480
00:49:56,379 --> 00:49:58,334
- Wanted?
- Yes!

481
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:02,857
I did not wish her death.

482
00:50:03,752 --> 00:50:05,891
I only knew it was inevitable...

483
00:50:06,357 --> 00:50:07,954
...as my death is inevitable.

484
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,255
Our blight must be removed
from this earth.

485
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:17,368
What lies beyond is something
else again.

486
00:50:32,878 --> 00:50:34,476
Must you close it now?

487
00:50:35,613 --> 00:50:38,182
She must take her place below
with the rest of the Ushers.

488
00:50:44,445 --> 00:50:46,434
One last look.

489
00:50:47,658 --> 00:50:49,313
I cannot bear to look at her.

490
00:50:58,763 --> 00:51:02,088
- I'll carry her with you.
- Bristol and I can manage.

491
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:05,439
I would rather if you don't mind.

492
00:51:07,473 --> 00:51:08,777
I'll carry her.

493
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:51,825
Come.

494
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,867
I just wanted to say goodbye.

495
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:52,620
Shall I prepare some breakfast
before you leave, Sir?

496
00:53:53,626 --> 00:53:56,196
- No, thank you.
- Some coffee, then?

497
00:53:57,065 --> 00:53:59,651
- Yes, a little bit.
- Very good, sir.

498
00:53:59,906 --> 00:54:02,428
- Shall I serve it in the...?
- No, no, I'll take it here.

499
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,954
You look tired, Sir.

500
00:54:20,995 --> 00:54:23,801
I don't suppose any of us 
slept much last night.

501
00:54:26,117 --> 00:54:27,392
No, Sir.

502
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:29,848
- Bristol.
- Yes?

503
00:54:31,659 --> 00:54:35,101
Do you think it was my coming
that caused Miss Madeline to...?

504
00:54:35,371 --> 00:54:37,254
Oh, no Sir, not at all.

505
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:41,030
- Miss Madeline was not well.
- Her brother thinks I killed her.

506
00:54:41,464 --> 00:54:44,438
It's just that he is highly
overwrought, Sir.

507
00:54:49,827 --> 00:54:52,147
- Yes, thank you for the coffee.
- Your welcome, Sir.

508
00:54:53,098 --> 00:54:55,266
Don't recriminate yourself, Mr. Winthrop.

509
00:54:55,813 --> 00:54:58,881
Miss Madeline's passing was not your fault.

510
00:54:59,707 --> 00:55:02,451
She was very weak, poor child.

511
00:55:05,378 --> 00:55:09,337
It was...the Usher blood.

512
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:13,680
There's been such a history of illness
in the family.

513
00:55:13,624 --> 00:55:18,294
Both with heart ailments, nervous
diseases, catalep...

514
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,756
And the like, Sir.
Miss Madeline was...

515
00:55:24,471 --> 00:55:26,318
- What did you say?
- Sir?

516
00:55:27,005 --> 00:55:29,608
- You s27,005 --> 00:55:29,608
- You s

517
00:55:31,648 --> 00:55:34,153
Was Madeline subject to
cataleptic trances?

518
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:36,891
- Oh no Sir, not Miss Madeline.
- The truth! Was she?

519
00:55:37,088 --> 00:55:38,309
No Sir!

520
00:55:40,107 --> 00:55:43,037
That's why Mr. Usher wanted to
put her in the crypt so soon.

521
00:55:43,232 --> 00:55:44,733
Oh, no Mr. Winthrop.

522
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,362
Oh my god!

523
00:55:52,035 --> 00:55:54,743
No, you are wrong, Sir!
You're wrong!

524
00:55:59,133 --> 00:56:00,218
Sir!

525
00:56:04,252 --> 00:56:06,074
Mr. Winthrop!

526
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:17,948
- Leave her in peace, Sir.
- Peace?

527
00:56:27,325 --> 00:56:29,903
Leave her in peace, Sir.

528
00:56:48,228 --> 00:56:50,470
Don't Sir! I beg of you.

529
00:57:05,365 --> 00:57:08,369
- Where is she?
- I don't know, Sir.

530
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,997
- Tell me!
- I don't know, I swear I don't know.

531
00:57:13,279 --> 00:57:14,933
I thought she was here.

532
00:57:15,282 --> 00:57:17,009
You knew she was alive.

533
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:21,250
- I wasn't sure, Sir.
- You weren't sure?

534
00:57:32,095 --> 00:57:33,219
Sir!

535
00:57:36,638 --> 00:57:38,286
Usher!

536
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:52,777
What do you wish?

537
00:57:53,361 --> 00:57:54,780
Where is she?

538
00:57:55,293 --> 00:57:56,491
So you know.

539
00:57:58,742 --> 00:57:59,784
Where?

540
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,389
You cannot find her.

541
00:58:03,652 --> 00:58:05,972
- Tell me where she is.
- In a secret place.

542
00:58:08,211 --> 00:58:11,341
- For the last time...
- Go on, you will be doing me 
a very great favour.

543
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:21,836
- Where is she?
- Don't touch me!

544
00:58:22,128 --> 00:58:23,809
- Where is she?
- Don't touch me!

545
00:58:27,182 --> 00:58:28,308
- Where is she?
- Dead.

546
00:58:29,383 --> 00:58:32,219
You lie! You buried her alive!

547
00:58:32,734 --> 00:58:35,618
I did...but she is dead now.

548
00:58:36,926 --> 00:58:38,463
- I swear it.
- You swear it?

549
00:58:39,824 --> 00:58:43,150
- You buried your own sister alive?
- But I had to do it.

550
00:58:44,223 --> 00:58:46,684
Can't you understand that?
She was doomed!

551
00:58:47,853 --> 00:58:50,433
Where is she?
Where is she?

552
00:58:54,259 --> 00:58:56,090
- Where is the secret place?
- Secret?

553
00:58:56,709 --> 00:58:59,465
- Bristol, you must know.
- I know nothing, Sir.

554
00:59:04,031 --> 00:59:05,531
I'll find her.

555
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:13,154
- Sir, was it necessary to...
- You know that it was.

556
00:59:52,784 --> 00:59:55,694
Please, Sir. Try to get some rest.

557
00:59:57,401 --> 01:00:00,285
- I've got to find her.
- But it's too late, Sir.

558
01:00:00,574 --> 01:00:03,871
- No!
- Please, Sir. Please.

559
01:00:04,094 --> 01:00:05,833
- She is alive.
- Try to get some rest.

560
01:00:06,338 --> 01:00:09,290
I know she is...she is alive.

561
01:04:35,182 --> 01:04:36,405
Still here?

562
01:04:37,492 --> 01:04:39,521
I suggest you leave, Mr. Winthrop.

563
01:04:43,326 --> 01:04:46,950
No? Then perish with us.

564
01:04:51,082 --> 01:04:52,848
The old house crumbles...

565
01:04:54,532 --> 01:04:56,600
Perhaps this storm will finish it.

566
01:04:59,814 --> 01:05:01,883
You have murdered your sister,
Mr. Usher...

567
01:05:02,874 --> 01:05:05,292
...and I intend to see that
you hang for it.

568
01:05:06,022 --> 01:05:06,759
Do you?

569
01:05:07,887 --> 01:05:09,645
Arrange it quickly, then.

570
01:05:11,232 --> 01:05:13,342
If only I could kill you myself.

571
01:05:13,906 --> 01:05:16,072
- Yes, if only you could.
- Yes.

572
01:05:23,644 --> 01:05:24,979
Why did you do it?

573
01:05:26,295 --> 01:05:27,531
I told you.

574
01:05:31,069 --> 01:05:32,886
You will never understand...

575
01:05:34,364 --> 01:05:37,334
...this so logical mind as yours
I have committed to murder.

576
01:05:38,674 --> 01:05:42,543
If you only knew the agonies
I have spared you in the world.

577
01:05:43,749 --> 01:05:47,629
If you only knew the agonies
I have endured in your behalf.

578
01:05:49,135 --> 01:05:49,972
Did you know...?

579
01:05:56,221 --> 01:05:59,793
Do you know that I could hear
every sound she made?

580
01:06:01,898 --> 01:06:05,022
That I heard her breathing
in her casket?

581
01:06:06,457 --> 01:06:09,210
Heard her first gasps as she awoke?

582
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:12,596
Her first scream of terror?

583
01:06:14,196 --> 01:06:17,202
Did you know that I could hear
the scratching of her fingernails...

584
01:06:17,511 --> 01:06:19,037
...on the casket lid?

585
01:06:19,383 --> 01:06:20,575
You are mad!

586
01:06:23,513 --> 01:06:24,836
Be gone!

587
01:06:25,735 --> 01:06:27,851
- What?
- Nothing, I rave.

588
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:31,491
You said, "Be done!",
what did you mean?

589
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:32,950
Nothing.

590
01:06:35,231 --> 01:06:36,773
- Is she still alive?
- No.

591
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:42,525
- Is she? Is she?
- Yes!

592
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:45,455
Yes, even now I hear her.

593
01:06:45,656 --> 01:06:48,162
- No...
- Yes...alive.

594
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:51,407
Deranged...
infuriate...

595
01:06:51,797 --> 01:06:53,613
Can you not hear her voice?

596
01:06:55,008 --> 01:06:57,970
Where? In the name of god, where?

597
01:06:58,370 --> 01:07:02,552
Below. Twisting...
turning...

598
01:07:03,077 --> 01:07:06,128
...scratching at the lid with
bloody fingernails.

599
01:07:06,376 --> 01:07:11,020
Staring, screaming, wild with fury,
the strength of madness in her.

600
01:07:11,798 --> 01:07:15,273
Can you not hear her voice?
She calls my name...

601
01:07:16,106 --> 01:07:17,342
Roderick!

602
01:07:17,843 --> 01:07:19,128
Roderick!

603
01:07:22,072 --> 01:07:23,572
<i>Roderick!!</i>

604
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:33,674
Where is she?

605
01:07:42,457 --> 01:07:43,744
No...

606
01:07:48,236 --> 01:07:49,275
- Give me this.
- Wait.

607
01:07:51,292 --> 01:07:52,715
Don't go down there.

608
01:07:54,339 --> 01:07:55,929
Let her die.

609
01:08:39,819 --> 01:08:41,492
She has the madness.

610
01:09:26,303 --> 01:09:27,908
Mr. Winthrop, please.

611
01:09:31,851 --> 01:09:34,287
- Leave her, Sir.
- Leave her?

612
01:09:34,508 --> 01:09:36,196
But you may never find her.

613
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:38,587
The house is honeycombed with 
secret passages.

614
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,322
She could be anywhere, Sir.

615
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:43,338
- I'll find her.
- But she is mad, Sir.

616
01:13:42,455 --> 01:13:44,623
Please, Mr. Winthrop, you must leave.

617
01:13:46,648 --> 01:13:49,838
- Where is she?
- Outside walls began to crack.

618
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:53,203
- Where has she gone? 
- I don't know. I beg of you, please.

619
01:13:53,667 --> 01:13:55,409
The whole house may at any moment...

620
01:14:08,937 --> 01:14:12,855
Madeline...
No....

621
01:14:22,397 --> 01:14:24,408
Madeline...

622
01:15:10,736 --> 01:15:13,776
There was no other way.
There was no other way...

623
01:17:19,456 --> 01:17:23,653
<i>"and the deep and dark tarn 
closed silently over...</i>

624
01:17:23,861 --> 01:17:29,281
<i>...the fragments of the House of Usher".
