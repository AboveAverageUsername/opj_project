3
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:09,666
Henry!

4
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,766
- There he is!
- Shit.

5
00:02:14,307 --> 00:02:16,280
- You got him?
- Let him eat.

6
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:18,293
Yeah. Let him eat it.

7
00:02:21,594 --> 00:02:24,887
All right, let's go!
Got him on!

8
00:02:24,982 --> 00:02:27,347
I got him!

9
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:32,066
<i>Come on!
Come on back! Whoo!</i>

10
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:35,812
- Yeah!
- Don't let it whip your ass!

11
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:38,624
He ain't goin' nowhere!

12
00:02:45,276 --> 00:02:48,207
Whoo!
Look at this puppy go!

13
00:02:48,312 --> 00:02:51,690
All right, hold up!
Hold up! He's running.

14
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:54,248
What is it?

15
00:02:54,353 --> 00:02:57,763
I don't know. Feels like a bull.
Maybe a hammerhead.

16
00:02:57,867 --> 00:03:00,253
- Oh, no, it's a bull.
- Yeah?

17
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:02,878
Okay, get ready.
He's turning.

18
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:07,422
I got him. I got him.

19
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,613
Fuck. Whoo! Whoo!

20
00:03:10,714 --> 00:03:14,507
<i>All right, here he is!
He's whupped! Let's do it!</i>

21
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:19,438
- Watch the mouth!
- Hey, you the one with the scar, man!

22
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:22,283
<i>Here we go!</i>

23
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,930
<i>- You got him! Come on!
- Henry!</i>

24
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:30,840
<i>Yeah!</i>

25
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:34,458
Peaceful out here.
Ain't it, Henry?

26
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:36,724
Yeah.

27
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,317
<i>¡Buenos días!
Good morning, Miami!</i>

28
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:49,606
<i>You are listening to 86.9, where the music
is hotter than the weather!</i>

29
00:03:53,507 --> 00:03:57,396
- Got sand up my pants.
- I don't do laundry.

30
00:03:57,502 --> 00:04:00,946
Hey. Here.

31
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,144
So, how much to get
your boat fixed, Henry?

32
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:07,854
New gasket, fuel pump,
paint job-

33
00:04:07,952 --> 00:04:11,014
Forget the paint.

34
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,731
- Fix it.
- Tears in my eyes, man.

35
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,001
Tears.

36
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:19,097
<i>I've had it with the beach.</i>

37
00:04:19,202 --> 00:04:22,045
This is the year
I get my own boat.

38
00:05:21,392 --> 00:05:24,902
- Your toast burned.
- I like it dark.

39
00:05:29,415 --> 00:05:33,305
You're not going to work like that.
Go put on a shirt.

40
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,317
<i>This is a shirt.</i>

41
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:38,518
No, this is a shirt.
It has a collar, sleeves, cuffs, buttons.

42
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:41,169
No rips, no tears, no slogans.

43
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:43,538
So fire me.

44
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:47,528
<i>It's too early for this, guys.</i>

45
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:51,337
- What's up?
- He wants me to change my shirt.

46
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,504
Oh.

47
00:05:56,228 --> 00:06:01,371
Well... you should
go change your shirt.

48
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:13,127
Nice to have you home,
just for the novelty.

49
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:20,284
I told you I was gonna play poker.

50
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,005
Boys' night out.

51
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:31,826
- I won.
- Hey! Lightning strikes.

52
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:35,369
We need to skip this conversation.

53
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:45,218
I was at the market yesterday
buying some groceries.

54
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:47,616
There was an enormous line...

55
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:51,602
and I was waiting
for the card to go through.

56
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,275
And there was this old lady who started
actually rolling oranges down the counter...

57
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,544
like a bowling alley.

58
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:02,379
We were canceled.

59
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,601
I know.

60
00:07:08,806 --> 00:07:11,771
I felt about as big as an ant.

61
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:15,965
It's the third time this year.

62
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:21,580
I'll get you a new one.
Things are gonna turn around.

63
00:07:23,283 --> 00:07:25,387
That's your theme song.

64
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,509
Get her to go easy
on the codeine, will ya.

65
00:07:46,614 --> 00:07:48,815
Makes her mean.

66
00:07:48,914 --> 00:07:53,349
Well, maybe if you got home on time once
in a while, she could skip the chemical help.

67
00:07:57,224 --> 00:08:00,732
<i>All she did was break her ankle, Alex.</i>

68
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:12,108
Did you never have
a fight with his father?

69
00:08:12,213 --> 00:08:14,315
- No.
- Ah.

70
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:16,804
A saint.
I should have known.

71
00:08:18,188 --> 00:08:20,769
Only the good die young.

72
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:31,638
<i>Oh! Alex.</i>

73
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:33,875
The Chateau Pichon-Longueville '85.

74
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:36,754
Stunning achievement.
Can I call it profound, Alex?

75
00:08:36,852 --> 00:08:40,197
Yeah, that's the word for it,
all right.

76
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:42,757
Profound. Okay.

77
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:50,842
Todd!
Has Jason loaded my car yet?

78
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:02,002
<i>A hundred seventy-seven yards in the first half.</i>

79
00:09:06,543 --> 00:09:08,710
Fish.

80
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,110
Not bad.

81
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,310
Fuck off.

82
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:15,417
<i>Third down, seven yards to go.</i>

83
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:18,388
You know what I was doing
when I was your age, Jason?

84
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:21,620
Selling ties in Saks Fifth Avenue
in New York City.

85
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:23,760
Hundreds and hundreds of ties.

86
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:27,341
One time I got so hot,
I sold the tie right off my own neck.

87
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:30,373
<i>I was pulling down 500 a week.</i>

88
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:33,889
<i>Lawyers made less,
and they went to college.</i>

89
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:36,642
<i>But you're broke.
They're not.</i>

90
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:41,015
I'm talking to you, Jason.
I'm trying to teach you things.

91
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:46,353
And what do I get?
Prime-time shit, shit and more shit.

92
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,803
Then you're probably used to it by now.
You've been around half my life.

93
00:09:52,116 --> 00:09:55,013
<i>He's changing his play at the line.</i>

94
00:09:55,117 --> 00:09:58,890
<i>This is Fryar in motion
to the right. Marino drops back.</i>

95
00:09:58,986 --> 00:10:01,406
<i>- Go deep. Deep!
- He's under pressure. He's looking for Fryar!</i>

96
00:10:01,511 --> 00:10:04,354
<i>Deep to Fryar!
Throw it!</i>

97
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:08,155
<i>We're back live. Just over
two minutes remaining in the half.</i>

98
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:12,404
- Tie score, Mike. You're in trouble.
- Don't underestimate Kelly.

99
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:16,493
- Kelly's walking in his sleep.
- You're a bad influence on him.

100
00:10:32,894 --> 00:10:35,031
<i>- Good morning.
- How are you?</i>

101
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,332
This is my stepson, Jason.

102
00:10:37,432 --> 00:10:42,215
Gabriela, Jason. Jason, Gabriela.

103
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,384
Hi.

104
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:52,289
How do you do?

105
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,853
Is Frank around?

106
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,377
They are down at the boat, Mr. Gates.

107
00:11:01,018 --> 00:11:03,915
- Where do you want this?
- These are for the voyage.

108
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:07,432
Show him to the boat.
I'm going to put this in the wine cellar.

109
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:09,705
Sure. Come on.

110
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:20,796
- You don't look like a maid.
- I'm not. I'm the nanny.

111
00:11:20,895 --> 00:11:23,674
Do I look like a nanny?

112
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:25,841
Nope.

113
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:28,975
Good, Mr. Reese. Much better.

114
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:31,081
- Much better?
- You're swinging too fast.

115
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:34,566
- Try to rotate your wrist a little bit.
- What's wrong with my wrist?

116
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,724
I never see anybody
to fish in the grass before.

117
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,618
<i>- Well!
- See?</i>

118
00:11:56,721 --> 00:12:00,938
<i>- Why can't you just buy bait and then fish?
- Fishing begins with bait.</i>

119
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:03,421
Everything does.

120
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:17,580
- Where you off to?
- Me?

121
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:19,756
I'm not going.

122
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:22,726
They hire an American nurse for the trip.

123
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:26,405
They go to Jamaica,
Bermuda, St. Barts.

124
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:30,080
- What are you gonna do?
- I house-sit.

125
00:12:31,236 --> 00:12:33,689
Anyway, he's fine.

126
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:37,368
<i>Ay, but I miss the baby.</i>

127
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:39,735
I like babies.

128
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,903
From the shoulder this time.

129
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:44,425
That one needs a pacifier.

130
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:47,495
Is that heavy?
You want to rest?

131
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:51,969
- You know how much a shark weighs?
- A shark? No.

132
00:12:52,074 --> 00:12:55,549
- How much a shark weigh?
- About three times as much as you.

133
00:12:55,654 --> 00:12:59,870
- You don't know that, because you don't know how much I weigh.
- Ah.

134
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:18,915
Where's the boss?

135
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:21,281
<i>He's up in the house.</i>

136
00:13:23,615 --> 00:13:28,019
- He'd open a bottle for me.
- I don't have a corkscrew.

137
00:13:34,323 --> 00:13:36,491
<i>What was that?</i>

138
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:39,206
The baby's kicking inside of the crib.

139
00:13:39,307 --> 00:13:42,272
<i>You don't know that.
She could have fallen out.</i>

140
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,423
- She's not crying.
- That's because she's dead on the floor.

141
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:50,901
Go check her.
That's why we have a monitor.

142
00:13:59,794 --> 00:14:04,361
<i>She's smart, but she's got
that cubano temperament.</i>

143
00:14:05,898 --> 00:14:08,000
Good for her.

144
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:40,055
Whoa.

145
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:07,094
Frank ever come on to you?

146
00:15:07,196 --> 00:15:09,647
He has a beautiful wife.

147
00:15:09,752 --> 00:15:11,690
Oh.

148
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:16,868
<i>She ever come on to you?</i>

149
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:21,445
Alex.

150
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,803
Uh, you ready?

151
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:26,840
Yeah.

152
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:33,266
I can see you
tomorrow night after class.

153
00:15:43,946 --> 00:15:47,487
Hope I didn't interrupt
your beauty sleep.

154
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:50,401
Well, I'm spared your type of day job.

155
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:53,310
Where are the photos?

156
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:56,948
The Reeses'll be gone three weeks.

157
00:15:57,051 --> 00:15:59,948
A step down from your place
in London, Vic.

158
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:03,529
The interesting thing about rich people is,
they're so cheap.

159
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:06,695
They'll spend 1.3 million on a necklace...

160
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:09,283
with diamonds
the size of chocolates.

161
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,672
Then they'll lock it
in a tin box from Sears.

162
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:19,320
- So we got no problems?
- Not with the box.

163
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:22,319
Where does the alarm wire lead?

164
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:24,463
I don't know.

165
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:28,878
Into the wall, Vic. All right?

166
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:31,842
Oh. Lovely.
Our first complication.

167
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:36,132
Look, you wanted photographs.
I got you photographs.

168
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,894
And I asked an amateur.

169
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:46,613
<i>Haven't exactly
been living in an ashram.</i>

170
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:51,506
- You trust the girl?
- Yeah, I trust her. She doesn't know anything.

171
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:53,706
Don't take it personally, Alex.

172
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:56,837
I don't trust the jury system, the phone
company or the Israeli government.

173
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:00,451
Can we quit jerking off, Vic?

174
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:04,125
- Are we gonna be ready tomorrow?
- Mm-hmm.

175
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,299
This is for you.

176
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:31,007
My family want to know
when they are going to meet you...

177
00:17:32,256 --> 00:17:34,772
this man that I see so much.

178
00:17:42,225 --> 00:17:44,329
They have expectations, Alex.

179
00:17:44,432 --> 00:17:46,467
That's all.

180
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:48,837
<i>So do I.</i>

181
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:50,691
Ahh. Come on.

182
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,150
- I'm gonna take you places, baby.
- Oh, yeah? Where?

183
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:05,674
How 'bout Paris?

184
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:12,417
We can stay at the Ritz...

185
00:18:12,523 --> 00:18:16,314
eat our way through every
three-star restaurant in town.

186
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:19,069
- Uh-huh.
- Buy you a suit at Chanel.

187
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,907
But no pink, please.
I don't look good in pink.

188
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:26,579
Okay. No pink.

189
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:34,893
Which one?

190
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,921
Mmm.

191
00:18:38,026 --> 00:18:40,641
- Both.
- I knew you'd say that.

192
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:54,990
You know, I could make a mistake
and believe you.

193
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:58,349
<i>You know, it's a mistake
not to believe me.</i>

194
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:37,212
Hi.

195
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:39,510
Go back to sleep.

196
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:16,607
I did this myself.

197
00:20:16,713 --> 00:20:19,939
I think I look younger
with my hair like this. Don't you?

198
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,507
You look like a janitor.

199
00:20:25,822 --> 00:20:29,876
Fine. I don't have an ego.

200
00:20:31,382 --> 00:20:34,377
Just so long as I don't
match my mug shots.

201
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:45,342
Jesus!

202
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,311
Take it easy.

203
00:21:18,106 --> 00:21:20,111
Ah, there you are, Mike.

204
00:21:20,215 --> 00:21:23,245
<i>- Don't flip the gate like that.
- We're running a little behind.</i>

205
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,244
- I got some wine-
- Well, you missed 'em already.

206
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,479
- They sailed this morning.
- Yeah, I know. They arranged for the nanny to let us in.

207
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,097
The Cuban girl?
They fired her.

208
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:34,912
<i>- What?
- Yeah, right before they left.</i>

209
00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:38,171
Guess it don't pay to have
that kind of ass in that kind of job, huh?

210
00:21:38,271 --> 00:21:40,376
I have a schedule to keep, Mr. Gates.

211
00:21:40,476 --> 00:21:43,669
- This'll have to be another day.
- This can't wait.

212
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:48,782
Mr. Reese will lose his entire wine collection
if we don't fix that humidifier.

213
00:21:48,882 --> 00:21:51,562
<i>- It'll cost him a fortune.
- What's your name?</i>

214
00:21:51,663 --> 00:21:53,763
Harold.

215
00:21:53,868 --> 00:21:56,647
Freeman.

216
00:21:56,745 --> 00:21:59,904
I'll have to go get the keys.

217
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:11,954
Dear God.
A cop on the job.

218
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,288
- This is where he can reach me.
- Okay.

219
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,329
Thank you.

220
00:22:19,435 --> 00:22:22,016
- Tell him I said I'm sorry.
- For what?

221
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:24,157
Hi, Jason.

222
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:26,395
- Sir.
- Thank you.

223
00:22:28,032 --> 00:22:30,549
- You're working for idiots.
- But those idiots pay me.

224
00:22:30,652 --> 00:22:33,551
They give me a roof.

225
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:36,172
Now I have to go stay with my cousins.

226
00:22:36,277 --> 00:22:40,133
My cousin, her husband,
her four kids and six cats.

227
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,376
And I hate cats.

228
00:22:42,475 --> 00:22:44,230
What's wrong with cats?

229
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,524
They leave hair all over the couch
where I have to sleep.

230
00:22:47,622 --> 00:22:50,652
You'll find another job.

231
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:52,638
Like it's easy.

232
00:22:53,918 --> 00:22:55,988
How old are you?

233
00:22:58,137 --> 00:23:01,329
You're not that much older than me.

234
00:23:03,825 --> 00:23:06,471
In this country everybody
thinks they're in politics.

235
00:23:06,573 --> 00:23:10,845
You don't have papers,
they don't want to meet you.

236
00:23:10,952 --> 00:23:12,576
Do you understand?

237
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:16,185
I'll give you a ride.

238
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,100
Oh, you wanna lose your job too?

239
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:21,584
Not even when I try.

240
00:23:36,008 --> 00:23:39,549
- Henry. How's it goin'?
- Hello, man.

241
00:23:44,284 --> 00:23:48,687
So, uh, you ain't
got to worry about it sinkin'.

242
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:51,982
<i>- I been working on it every day.
- Cool.</i>

243
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:58,953
What's the matter?
You nervous?

244
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,538
You okay?

245
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,094
- Good luck.
- Gabriela!

246
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:14,868
You gonna be able to fix the thing, Harold,
or do you need a replacement?

247
00:24:14,964 --> 00:24:18,854
I'll tell you when I see
the condition of the pipes.

248
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,161
The coolant might be leaking.

249
00:24:26,311 --> 00:24:29,154
Where's the attic access?

250
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:34,101
Damn fiberglass.

251
00:24:34,204 --> 00:24:37,234
Either of you know how to kill
the water to the house?

252
00:24:37,335 --> 00:24:39,603
Oh, yeah.
Sure, sure.

253
00:24:48,585 --> 00:24:50,971
So, where are we going?

254
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:53,562
<i>Ah, we got about four hours to Cuba.</i>

255
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:55,802
Oh, really?

256
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:58,137
It took me a week.

257
00:24:59,771 --> 00:25:02,354
Fifteen of us on a very small boat.

258
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:07,401
- I can turn around if you want.
- No, it's okay.

259
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:10,218
I like the water.

260
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:14,589
Even when we were coming over,
the sea was so beautiful.

261
00:25:16,229 --> 00:25:19,128
I never wanted to sleep.

262
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:21,401
I was happy.

263
00:25:29,556 --> 00:25:32,487
I was ashamed to be so happy.

264
00:25:35,182 --> 00:25:37,381
People were dying.

265
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:52,049
- You still have family in Cuba?
- Oh, yes.

266
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:55,759
And I'm gonna bring them-
one by one, if I have to.

267
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:03,877
You don't think I can do that?

268
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,349
I think there's no stopping you.

269
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:19,087
<i>You understand, Mike?
Television. Money.</i>

270
00:26:19,188 --> 00:26:22,250
<i>Where's the sport?
Where is the honor in that?</i>

271
00:26:22,352 --> 00:26:26,122
Any honor in that? Huh?
Foreign products on it.

272
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,998
<i>Ever been to Cleveland, Mike? What are
they gonna do with all them doggie masks?</i>

273
00:26:29,095 --> 00:26:32,952
What's going on, Mike?
I been waiting on you. My shift?

274
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,955
<i>- What are you talking about?
- Come on. Remember? They changed the schedule.</i>

275
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:37,947
<i>Well, shit, nobody told me.</i>

276
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:40,495
<i>- What are you doing with that sprinkler valve?
- Sprinkler valve?</i>

277
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:43,825
The fuck it's a sprinkler valve.
We got some kind of emergency.

278
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:46,823
- Who's he?
- Uh, Alex Gates.

279
00:26:46,928 --> 00:26:49,096
Gates Wine?

280
00:27:00,062 --> 00:27:02,516
Harold?

281
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,019
Harold?

282
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,195
- Huh. Wind?
- Keep goin'.

283
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:53,327
Well, I'll tell ya...

284
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:55,701
<i>it ain't the pipes.</i>

285
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,950
I've tightened a couple of valves in the attic.

286
00:28:03,343 --> 00:28:05,728
- And I've taped some of the gaps.
- Yeah?

287
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:10,236
- But you're not supposed to be in the house unaccompanied.
- Well, is that our fault?

288
00:28:27,438 --> 00:28:31,142
<i>Sometimes, when we're waiting
for the fish to bite...</i>

289
00:28:31,241 --> 00:28:34,084
I sit right there...

290
00:28:35,396 --> 00:28:38,806
look out, watch the horizon.

291
00:28:38,911 --> 00:28:41,243
There's nothing to see.

292
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,947
I don't want to see anything.

293
00:28:45,047 --> 00:28:50,158
Just that line- that line
where the water touches the sky.

294
00:28:50,257 --> 00:28:52,292
No neighbors.

295
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,046
No barking dogs.

296
00:28:55,145 --> 00:28:57,314
Nobody in your face.

297
00:28:58,885 --> 00:29:00,955
No bullshit.

298
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:02,997
Except your own.

299
00:29:03,103 --> 00:29:05,816
Yeah, well,
I can handle my own.

300
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:08,084
I like my bullshit.

301
00:29:08,185 --> 00:29:10,638
It's not bad.

302
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,910
It probably even works.

303
00:29:20,936 --> 00:29:23,105
You wanna be alone?

304
00:29:30,237 --> 00:29:33,615
<i>Now, this is
a thousand points of light.</i>

305
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,881
<i>- Reagan didn't know what he was talking about.
- Bush.</i>

306
00:29:39,632 --> 00:29:43,075
- What?
- Bush said that, not Reagan.

307
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,103
Bullshit. It was Reagan.
Bush was "Read my lips. "

308
00:29:50,242 --> 00:29:54,068
- What did you just do?
- I like to take a photo of the goods.

309
00:29:54,173 --> 00:29:56,505
Avoids any disagreement on the sale.

310
00:29:56,603 --> 00:30:00,427
- You got me in the picture.
- Did I?

311
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:03,494
Give me the photograph.

312
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,216
We'll tear it up
when we have the money.

313
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,770
<i>There's no such thing
as honor among thieves. It's a myth.</i>

314
00:30:15,682 --> 00:30:17,883
<i>- What's this?
- I thought it over.</i>

315
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:21,142
I can't move that. I'm on parole.
I'm known. You're not.

316
00:30:21,244 --> 00:30:25,873
<i>So you'll fly to New York, catch a cab,
take a walk, find an address.</i>

317
00:30:25,973 --> 00:30:28,816
<i>Pas de problème,
as they say in Bordeaux.</i>

318
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:31,811
In other words,
you're too chickenshit to do it yourself.

319
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:34,729
Maybe I am.

320
00:30:34,824 --> 00:30:37,059
You're right. I am.

321
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:47,190
I don't fly economy.

322
00:31:16,212 --> 00:31:19,721
<i>Telephone.</i>

323
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:27,707
- Hello.
- Hey, I got the note. Fuck the Reeses.

324
00:31:27,812 --> 00:31:31,583
I'll pick you up in an hour.
We're booked on a 10:15 flight to New York.

325
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,319
<i>Papi, tell me you love me.</i>

326
00:31:35,418 --> 00:31:37,684
<i>Chica.</i>

327
00:31:37,783 --> 00:31:39,952
You'll see.

328
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,807
Where are you going to this time?

329
00:32:55,763 --> 00:32:58,662
Napa. I got a problem with a supplier.

330
00:32:58,766 --> 00:33:01,033
<i>Goddamn California boutique wineries.</i>

331
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:03,200
They're all owned by lawyers.

332
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:09,913
- Oh, I was looking for those.
- Tom and Lucy Garcia?

333
00:33:12,637 --> 00:33:16,559
They're agents. They're going to
New York to see a wholesaler.

334
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:18,603
First class?

335
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:22,502
Yes. Sometimes you gotta
keep up relationships.

336
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:26,635
Apparently not with me.

337
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:30,945
Don't you have physical therapy tonight?

338
00:33:31,044 --> 00:33:34,815
Oh, you didn't notice.
The bandage is off.

339
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:37,243
Did I come home too early?

340
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:42,768
Look, I got an idea.

341
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,768
Sit down at your desk and write out
all your complaints.

342
00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:50,342
Then when I get back, we can have one
of those nice, long fights you like so much.

343
00:33:50,443 --> 00:33:52,829
But right now
I gotta catch a plane.

344
00:33:52,937 --> 00:33:55,933
So give me the goddamn tickets!

345
00:33:56,037 --> 00:33:58,553
- That is my suitcase!
- I'll FedEx it to ya.

346
00:33:58,657 --> 00:34:02,002
<i>- You're gonna talk to me!
- You already broke your leg on these stairs once, Suzanne.</i>

347
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:05,006
- I don't want it to happen again.
- I tripped on one of your damn golf balls!

348
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:07,891
- I wasn't drunk!
- You were plastered!

349
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:11,661
I put Terry's life insurance into that store,
and you spent it on your girlfriends...

350
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:14,789
while my checks bounced!

351
00:34:14,893 --> 00:34:17,126
I let you mortgage my house!

352
00:34:17,226 --> 00:34:21,496
Eight years I worked my cock off in that
store for you- 12-hour days, one-day weekends!

353
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:24,154
Don't you tell me I didn't try!

354
00:34:24,257 --> 00:34:26,294
<i>All right, give me the keys.</i>

355
00:34:26,396 --> 00:34:28,370
- You are gonna talk to me.
- Give me the keys.

356
00:34:28,474 --> 00:34:31,188
Wasting my life!

357
00:34:31,287 --> 00:34:34,066
I don't wanna hurt you!

358
00:34:34,163 --> 00:34:37,159
No! No!

359
00:34:37,263 --> 00:34:40,008
No! Aaah!

360
00:34:55,574 --> 00:34:57,329
You bastard!

361
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,014
<i>What's going on?</i>

362
00:36:12,115 --> 00:36:14,218
- What happened?
- We're leaving.

363
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:16,806
- Mom-Jesus Christ!
- No! Don't go in there!

364
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:19,044
<i>- Mom?
- Don't go in there!</i>

365
00:36:19,147 --> 00:36:21,250
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

366
00:36:21,351 --> 00:36:24,283
<i>- I won't wait for you!
- Wait for me!</i>

367
00:36:53,472 --> 00:36:55,638
- Is he dead?
- Not enough.

368
00:37:13,795 --> 00:37:15,834
- My wallet!
- What?

369
00:37:15,937 --> 00:37:18,040
- Oh, my God, my wallet.
- Where is it?

370
00:37:18,142 --> 00:37:20,527
- Look in my bag!
- Just pull over!

371
00:37:20,636 --> 00:37:23,795
<i>- I can drive! I taught you to drive!
- No, I'm gonna drive.</i>

372
00:37:26,164 --> 00:37:29,640
Oh, God.
I've gotta calm down.

373
00:37:29,745 --> 00:37:33,034
- But you don't even know where we're going.
- All right, all right.

374
00:37:33,132 --> 00:37:36,259
- Where?
- Okay, can you get to Key Largo?

375
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,975
A friend of mine has a houseboat.
We can use it for a while.

376
00:37:39,076 --> 00:37:42,419
Mom, relax.
We'll be there in an hour.

377
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:54,392
How'd she find this place?

378
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,690
Linda has a weakness for bartenders.

379
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:01,134
Well, it's a short walk for a beer.

380
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:05,202
- Where's the key, Mom?
- Here, I think.

381
00:39:12,554 --> 00:39:14,624
Mugged by your own wife, eh?

382
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:18,972
How ironic.

383
00:39:19,074 --> 00:39:21,493
You should have let me do it.

384
00:39:21,598 --> 00:39:23,700
I darned my own socks in prison.

385
00:39:33,934 --> 00:39:36,419
Lovely.

386
00:39:36,525 --> 00:39:39,421
<i>They won't be hard to find.</i>

387
00:39:39,527 --> 00:39:43,296
I never understand your optimism.

388
00:39:43,395 --> 00:39:45,531
It lacks foundation.

389
00:39:45,631 --> 00:39:47,963
I know 'em.

390
00:39:48,061 --> 00:39:50,262
I know how they think.

391
00:39:50,361 --> 00:39:53,356
<i>"Director of catering.</i>

392
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:56,685
<i>Island concierge. "
Sounds great.</i>

393
00:39:56,784 --> 00:39:59,944
<i>"Landscape.
Housekeeping manager. "</i>

394
00:40:00,045 --> 00:40:03,238
Oh, I see some definite possibilities here.

395
00:40:03,336 --> 00:40:06,714
You don't need to take a job you don't like.
I've got enough money.

396
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,685
You don't.
Believe me.

397
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:16,466
Your name Henry?

398
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,323
<i>I'm Jason's father, Alex.</i>

399
00:40:21,425 --> 00:40:23,398
His father is dead.

400
00:40:23,502 --> 00:40:26,215
Well, stepfather.

401
00:40:26,314 --> 00:40:28,069
Yeah, so, uh-
so, where is he?

402
00:40:28,169 --> 00:40:30,239
<i>- He didn't show up last night.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

403
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:34,711
Well, he didn't come home either.
His mother's worried about him.

404
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:38,738
Well, maybe he's at
his girlfriend's house, you know.

405
00:40:38,842 --> 00:40:41,970
You know where she is?

406
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:46,985
Uh... no.

407
00:40:47,088 --> 00:40:49,954
I just- I just figured
there has to be one.

408
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:52,359
- Give us a hint.
- Hey! How am I supposed to know?

409
00:40:52,457 --> 00:40:55,714
- Oh, shit!
- Hey!

410
00:40:55,812 --> 00:40:58,710
Goddamn it!
You're not helping!

411
00:40:59,743 --> 00:41:01,748
- Aaah!
- Damn it!

412
00:41:01,853 --> 00:41:03,705
- God!
- Christ.

413
00:41:03,803 --> 00:41:07,060
<i>You all right? You all right?</i>

414
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,944
- Yeah.
- Let me see.

415
00:41:09,043 --> 00:41:12,172
- God!
- Oh, yeah. Okay. You're all right.

416
00:41:12,271 --> 00:41:16,489
Look, Henry. We got
a serious business problem.

417
00:41:16,586 --> 00:41:18,689
Can you tell him?

418
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:20,893
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Thanks.

419
00:41:20,995 --> 00:41:24,287
- You sure you're all right?
- Yes.

420
00:41:32,788 --> 00:41:35,154
Did he hurt ya?

421
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:38,892
Don't ever do that to me again.

422
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:47,769
That's 356 round stones-

423
00:41:47,874 --> 00:41:51,959
Either the whole piece or individual stones.
Put the word out, Marty.

424
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:55,155
The central stone weighs 32 carats.
They're all perfectly matched.

425
00:41:55,256 --> 00:41:59,624
No, I'm consulting for the insurance
company now. Life's strange, isn't it?

426
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,833
Kid never goes far from water.

427
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:04,649
Call Sarasota,
Fort Meyers, Key West.

428
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:07,873
<i>- You find your visor?
- No.</i>

429
00:42:07,974 --> 00:42:10,938
Well, it's in there.
Look in the pocket.

430
00:42:27,534 --> 00:42:29,572
This was in the suitcase.

431
00:42:35,301 --> 00:42:37,337
<i>Goddamn son of a bitch.</i>

432
00:42:39,263 --> 00:42:41,561
You know what paste costs?
Good paste?

433
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:44,438
- It's yours now.
- I don't want anything of his.

434
00:42:44,536 --> 00:42:48,654
- Send it back. Throw it away. Get rid of the damn thing.
- Okay.

435
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:57,158
- How much do you think it's worth?
- Seventy-five dollars.

436
00:42:57,256 --> 00:42:59,707
- Seventy-five dollars?
- For the appraisal.

437
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:02,046
- Oh.
- If you want it in writing-

438
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:04,149
Just approximately. I mean-

439
00:43:04,254 --> 00:43:07,153
No one is gonna pay
a million dollars around here.

440
00:43:07,258 --> 00:43:09,359
- Maybe in Miami.
- A million dollars?

441
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:11,948
More in New York.

442
00:43:12,052 --> 00:43:14,219
I have some private contacts.

443
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:18,053
Why don't you give me your number.

444
00:43:18,157 --> 00:43:20,293
Um...

445
00:43:20,393 --> 00:43:23,423
I'm gonna come back and see ya.

446
00:43:23,525 --> 00:43:25,595
You staying around here?

447
00:43:25,697 --> 00:43:27,867
Thanks.

448
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,637
I- Is this-

449
00:43:38,738 --> 00:43:42,051
I want to speak to a Mr. Victor.

450
00:43:42,157 --> 00:43:44,194
I'm calling from Largo.

451
00:43:44,298 --> 00:43:46,367
We could sign on to a charter.

452
00:43:46,471 --> 00:43:48,988
That's what you and Dad
were gonna do.

453
00:43:49,091 --> 00:43:51,162
I'll crew, you cook.

454
00:43:51,266 --> 00:43:55,699
- Why? It's pretty here.
- Mom, it's next to a bar.

455
00:43:57,017 --> 00:43:59,187
<i>- True.
- Come on.</i>

456
00:44:02,226 --> 00:44:04,558
The Mediterranean, huh?

457
00:44:04,655 --> 00:44:06,758
The Turkish coast?

458
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:08,963
It's great fishing there.

459
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:11,168
Okay. Freedom.

460
00:44:16,801 --> 00:44:19,350
It's obvious she love you.

461
00:44:19,453 --> 00:44:23,539
What is that, some kind of Latin concept?
Kill the one you love?

462
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:26,930
Well, I could do the same to keep you.

463
00:44:27,027 --> 00:44:29,839
- You don't say.
- Uh-huh.

464
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:32,484
Then my cousins would come...

465
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:35,996
put you on a spit
and roast you like a pig.

466
00:44:36,104 --> 00:44:39,710
Do me a favor.
Don't love me.

467
00:44:43,773 --> 00:44:46,225
You, uh-

468
00:44:46,329 --> 00:44:48,715
You okay for cash
while I'm gone?

469
00:44:51,508 --> 00:44:54,700
Alex, I thought
I was coming with you.

470
00:44:54,798 --> 00:44:56,934
You are, when I get back.

471
00:44:57,036 --> 00:44:59,400
This is just a couple of days.

472
00:44:59,498 --> 00:45:02,394
Dull, boring days.

473
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:10,834
Hey!
Thanks, boss.

474
00:45:16,754 --> 00:45:18,857
Hi.

475
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:25,119
<i>¡Voy! ¡Voy! ¡Ya vengo!</i>

476
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:29,595
What are you doing here?

477
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:31,932
Came to see the cats.

478
00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:38,831
- Well, I am moving soon anyway.
- Moving? Where?

479
00:45:41,266 --> 00:45:43,205
Uh-

480
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:47,622
With who?

481
00:45:47,723 --> 00:45:49,858
Someone I care about.

482
00:45:52,006 --> 00:45:54,174
Good.

483
00:45:58,844 --> 00:46:01,524
Are you happy?

484
00:46:03,222 --> 00:46:05,391
Yeah.

485
00:46:06,674 --> 00:46:08,811
You don't look so happy.

486
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:14,181
Well, I guess you are going to
have to take my word for it.

487
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:17,283
Yeah, I guess so.

488
00:46:20,257 --> 00:46:22,457
<i>Bueno.</i>

489
00:46:28,821 --> 00:46:32,133
You can reach me there for a while.

490
00:46:33,775 --> 00:46:36,193
Take care of yourself.

491
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,468
Yeah. You too.

492
00:47:07,203 --> 00:47:10,469
<i>I had no idea packing
was such an art form, Alex.</i>

493
00:47:10,573 --> 00:47:14,780
<i>The way you fold your shirts,
we'd have been there already.</i>

494
00:47:24,503 --> 00:47:26,651
Come here.

495
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:30,956
Hold still.

496
00:47:35,076 --> 00:47:37,255
That's been irritating me all day.

497
00:47:39,541 --> 00:47:41,936
Did it hurt you?

498
00:47:44,764 --> 00:47:46,912
Jesus.

499
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:51,756
Fuck if it hurt me.

500
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:02,230
Henry!

501
00:48:02,336 --> 00:48:04,513
Henry?

502
00:48:12,782 --> 00:48:14,928
<i>- Henry! You in the head?
- Hey!</i>

503
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:16,702
Hey, yo.

504
00:48:16,802 --> 00:48:18,443
- Get off my boat.
- What?

505
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:21,069
<i>- Get off my boat!
- What's going on, man?</i>

506
00:48:21,171 --> 00:48:23,125
Goddamn Miami!
Nothing but gangsters and hustlers, man!

507
00:48:23,229 --> 00:48:25,722
I thought you were smarter than that!

508
00:48:27,343 --> 00:48:30,475
Hey. Henry!
What happened to your head, man?

509
00:48:30,573 --> 00:48:33,952
Part of my courtesy call
from one of your associates.

510
00:48:34,056 --> 00:48:37,876
- What?
- That big old motherfucker? Thinks he's Queen of England?

511
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:41,176
- Who? - Six foot. Spray-painted
black hair, weird mustache.

512
00:48:41,274 --> 00:48:43,766
I don't know what you're talking about!

513
00:48:43,868 --> 00:48:45,954
Your stepfather saved my ass.

514
00:48:49,186 --> 00:48:51,337
Alex was here?

515
00:48:54,445 --> 00:48:58,329
<i>I'm ready to retire, man.
Open a bar in Bequia.</i>

516
00:48:58,433 --> 00:49:01,563
The only fish I wanna see
is on a plate with a piece of lemon.

517
00:49:05,178 --> 00:49:07,961
Henry.
How much for your boat?

518
00:49:08,057 --> 00:49:10,400
<i>I gotta get out of here.</i>

519
00:49:12,995 --> 00:49:15,239
You moving contraband?

520
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:19,449
Just moving.

521
00:49:42,748 --> 00:49:44,798
How far is it to Largo?

522
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,768
Uh, 20 minutes.

523
00:49:54,588 --> 00:49:58,733
Suzanne knew a girl that
used to come down here.

524
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:01,260
Uh... Linda. Linda.

525
00:50:01,363 --> 00:50:03,543
Last name?

526
00:50:03,643 --> 00:50:07,625
Why don't you just drop it
in the gas tank, Vic? Why waste time?

527
00:50:07,727 --> 00:50:11,429
That way, you don't have to wait around
till you fucking choke to death.

528
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:01,385
Hey. "Jason, gone
for a drink. Love, Mom. "

529
00:51:01,482 --> 00:51:04,612
This is a very considerate woman.

530
00:51:04,712 --> 00:51:08,663
I'll go keep her happy
while you look for the piece.

531
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,945
No rough stuff, Vic.

532
00:51:37,954 --> 00:51:40,167
All right.

533
00:52:09,304 --> 00:52:11,763
<i>Would you like to dance?</i>

534
00:52:11,865 --> 00:52:17,299
Yes. I was beginning to think
nobody knew how to around here.

535
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,462
<i>Hey, Jason.</i>

536
00:52:23,566 --> 00:52:25,429
Here you go.

537
00:52:25,526 --> 00:52:27,479
Thanks.

538
00:52:55,251 --> 00:52:57,203
- Mom.
- Jason, hi.

539
00:52:57,306 --> 00:52:59,646
- Let's get out of here.
- The song isn't over.

540
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:02,233
- We gotta go, Mom!
- Get outta here.

541
00:53:05,813 --> 00:53:08,812
- Come on. Let's go.
- I was only dancing.

542
00:53:08,914 --> 00:53:11,532
You don't know who that is!

543
00:53:11,632 --> 00:53:15,202
I said, the song isn't over!

544
00:53:17,767 --> 00:53:21,078
Back off! Get your hands off me, man!
That's my mother!

545
00:53:38,469 --> 00:53:41,820
Get outta here!
Get off me!

546
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:46,475
Are you all right, sir?

547
00:53:46,578 --> 00:53:49,397
<i>- Get outta here!
- Get him a glass of water, Mark.</i>

548
00:53:49,491 --> 00:53:53,066
Come on, folks. Mosey inside.
Let's go. The party's over.

549
00:53:53,168 --> 00:53:56,362
<i>What are you doing?</i>

550
00:54:26,299 --> 00:54:28,255
Why didn't you tell me, Jason?

551
00:54:28,358 --> 00:54:32,030
You'd have given it back to Alex.

552
00:54:32,128 --> 00:54:36,081
Is the guy behind us?

553
00:54:39,066 --> 00:54:41,656
It's in the car.

554
00:54:41,758 --> 00:54:44,100
If it's not in the houseboat,
it's in the car.

555
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,409
Yeah, sure.

556
00:54:46,508 --> 00:54:48,463
<i>Jason?</i>

557
00:54:48,566 --> 00:54:50,436
Yeah.

558
00:54:50,532 --> 00:54:55,240
I would have kept
the thing too. I would.

559
00:54:59,875 --> 00:55:02,056
Maybe it isn't him.

560
00:55:05,546 --> 00:55:09,283
<i>Maybe.</i>

561
00:55:17,962 --> 00:55:20,044
Watch it, Mom!

562
00:55:25,944 --> 00:55:29,175
Will you, for Christ's sake,
take it easy!

563
00:55:30,315 --> 00:55:32,185
Seat belts!

564
00:55:34,243 --> 00:55:35,754
Damn!

565
00:55:43,746 --> 00:55:45,615
Damn!

566
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:53,999
I have to pass.

567
00:55:57,779 --> 00:56:00,847
<i>Ma, you're not gonna make it!
Turn back!</i>

568
00:56:00,947 --> 00:56:04,555
Shit! Shit.

569
00:56:11,463 --> 00:56:13,677
Jesus.

570
00:56:15,454 --> 00:56:17,375
I gotta go.

571
00:56:54,736 --> 00:56:57,390
<i>- Oh, God.
- We don't have much time.</i>

572
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:00,747
Jesus Christ!
We gotta get some help!

573
00:57:00,842 --> 00:57:05,806
It's already on its way, I'm afraid.

574
00:57:05,907 --> 00:57:07,797
<i>What's going on out there?</i>

575
00:57:07,901 --> 00:57:09,766
Jesus!

576
00:57:11,287 --> 00:57:14,663
Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

577
00:57:14,767 --> 00:57:17,800
Oh, Christ, baby.

578
00:57:17,899 --> 00:57:21,094
Oh. Oh.

579
00:57:21,192 --> 00:57:24,471
- Jason.
- Oh, God.

580
00:57:24,577 --> 00:57:27,101
Jason.

581
00:57:27,202 --> 00:57:29,762
Oh. Oh, God.

582
00:57:31,696 --> 00:57:34,416
Oh!

583
00:57:38,278 --> 00:57:41,095
Hey, I think he's all right.

584
00:57:48,496 --> 00:57:50,828
<i>Come on, Alex. Get outta there.</i>

585
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:53,254
She's dying, you maniac!

586
00:57:57,987 --> 00:58:01,594
Hear the sirens? Help's coming, baby.

587
00:58:01,694 --> 00:58:04,241
Just tell me where it is.

588
00:58:04,343 --> 00:58:08,269
Just tell me where it is
so I can get out of your life.

589
00:58:12,687 --> 00:58:16,097
What? What?

590
00:58:17,288 --> 00:58:20,249
Fuck you.

591
00:58:20,354 --> 00:58:24,244
<i>We're out of time, Alex.
You can stay if you want, but I'm leaving.</i>

592
00:59:19,887 --> 00:59:23,777
I thought it went well.
Very organized.

593
00:59:23,881 --> 00:59:28,958
Quick. Cremation
is the civilized choice.

594
00:59:29,058 --> 00:59:32,152
Ashes straight to ashes.

595
00:59:32,253 --> 00:59:35,989
Skip the whole business
of decay and worms.

596
00:59:36,086 --> 00:59:39,311
I worry enough about worms as it is.

597
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,416
Shut up, Victor.

598
00:59:41,523 --> 00:59:44,549
<i>Hey, yo, Larry!</i>

599
00:59:44,651 --> 00:59:47,233
There's no place to sit.

600
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:57,078
<i>- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- How's that?</i>

601
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,907
Fine.

602
01:00:16,607 --> 01:00:18,992
We'll see her right now.

603
01:00:26,928 --> 01:00:30,239
This is a hospital, not a prison.
We don't lock the patients in their rooms.

604
01:00:30,349 --> 01:00:33,606
- You told me he was sedated.
- He asked me about her. I had to tell him.

605
01:00:33,704 --> 01:00:35,871
No. You did not.

606
01:01:54,867 --> 01:01:56,840
Wake up, Alex.

607
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:02,015
<i>I wanna see your face!</i>

608
01:02:07,108 --> 01:02:09,722
Oh, Jesus.

609
01:02:16,152 --> 01:02:18,797
- He's not here.
- Where is he?

610
01:02:18,897 --> 01:02:21,544
- He said he was going to get you.
- Well, his car's here.

611
01:02:21,647 --> 01:02:26,114
- It's been here. He was in Napa when he found out.
- You don't know where he was.

612
01:02:26,215 --> 01:02:28,963
He called me.

613
01:02:29,062 --> 01:02:31,425
So this is the guy?

614
01:02:34,557 --> 01:02:38,260
The man you cared
so much about-Alex!

615
01:02:40,341 --> 01:02:42,892
What was I supposed to say, Jason?

616
01:02:42,995 --> 01:02:45,889
When? How?

617
01:02:45,993 --> 01:02:48,611
You didn't waste any time, did you?

618
01:02:48,712 --> 01:02:51,874
You moved right on in.

619
01:02:51,973 --> 01:02:54,138
Put away the knife.

620
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:58,709
You told him how to find us.
You had the number.

621
01:02:58,812 --> 01:03:01,393
No, I threw that away.

622
01:03:01,496 --> 01:03:04,175
You told him how to find us.

623
01:03:04,275 --> 01:03:06,726
He didn't care, okay?
He was glad she left!

624
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:09,697
Yeah, so were you.

625
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:16,801
Yes.

626
01:03:18,687 --> 01:03:20,984
But not about what happened.

627
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,924
Her loss, your gain.

628
01:03:29,392 --> 01:03:32,007
Her house.

629
01:03:32,109 --> 01:03:35,104
Her bed.

630
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:37,691
Her life.

631
01:03:43,995 --> 01:03:45,881
Oh, Jason.

632
01:03:58,472 --> 01:04:01,215
<i>Hey, get another key at the front desk.</i>

633
01:04:01,315 --> 01:04:03,198
Okay. I'll get it.

634
01:04:07,738 --> 01:04:10,964
<i>Newscaster] And now that the high
pressure system has moved through the area...</i>

635
01:04:11,063 --> 01:04:14,569
<i>- we can expect blue skies
over the entire central region.</i>

636
01:04:14,673 --> 01:04:17,451
<i>Announcer Continues, Indistinct]</i>

637
01:04:20,295 --> 01:04:22,332
Vic?

638
01:04:22,437 --> 01:04:24,670
What's the matter?

639
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:37,512
This is not an oceanfront suite in Marbella.

640
01:04:37,617 --> 01:04:40,743
Did you notice that?

641
01:04:40,842 --> 01:04:46,531
There are no flowers
and champagne from the management.

642
01:04:46,628 --> 01:04:52,019
I don't- I don't see
a Swiss chocolate on my pillow.

643
01:04:57,589 --> 01:05:01,258
My masseuse is not at the door.

644
01:05:10,976 --> 01:05:15,377
And I am fucking dying, Alex.

645
01:05:31,044 --> 01:05:35,957
I do not intend to suffocate
in a county hospital...

646
01:05:36,062 --> 01:05:40,725
because you are fucking sentimental.

647
01:05:40,825 --> 01:05:43,948
Take it easy, Vic.

648
01:05:51,717 --> 01:05:57,079
<i>So, assuming
that we ever find the kid...</i>

649
01:06:04,342 --> 01:06:07,785
we'll use a blowtorch on him...

650
01:06:07,888 --> 01:06:10,373
until he cooperates.

651
01:06:13,162 --> 01:06:16,005
For example.

652
01:06:16,101 --> 01:06:19,544
Don't worry, Vic.
We'll find him.

653
01:06:19,648 --> 01:06:22,809
We got a week.

654
01:07:08,508 --> 01:07:14,162
Hi. He made it home without you.

655
01:07:19,277 --> 01:07:23,331
How, uh, resourceful.

656
01:07:23,432 --> 01:07:28,247
I've been touring every marina and dock
for 50 miles lookin' for you.

657
01:07:28,352 --> 01:07:33,712
- You should've called home.
- You don't just walk out of a hospital with a head injury.

658
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:35,601
My head's fine.

659
01:07:38,097 --> 01:07:39,981
Isn't it?

660
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:44,193
Are you hungry?

661
01:07:46,694 --> 01:07:49,077
Tell him.

662
01:07:50,624 --> 01:07:53,237
Tell him.

663
01:07:56,345 --> 01:07:58,763
He seemed fine.

664
01:08:00,848 --> 01:08:03,429
Did you eat lunch?

665
01:08:05,737 --> 01:08:07,774
I don't think you've even
said hello to her, Alex.

666
01:08:07,878 --> 01:08:10,399
Hello, Gabby.

667
01:08:13,086 --> 01:08:15,900
"Did you miss me, honey?"

668
01:08:17,113 --> 01:08:19,023
What are you doing?

669
01:08:51,564 --> 01:08:54,656
No wonder you never
got home on time.

670
01:08:56,356 --> 01:08:59,516
We've got to ignore
the personal history here, Jason...

671
01:08:59,615 --> 01:09:01,520
and do some business.

672
01:09:01,626 --> 01:09:05,266
- Who's your English pal?
- These are dangerous people.

673
01:09:05,366 --> 01:09:07,916
You don't steal
from dangerous people.

674
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:10,862
Do you know he ran us
off the fucking road?

675
01:09:10,959 --> 01:09:13,125
Be comin' after you too.
You figured that out yet?

676
01:09:13,226 --> 01:09:15,810
I'm countin' on it.

677
01:09:15,912 --> 01:09:18,942
Do the smart thing
once in your life.

678
01:09:19,043 --> 01:09:21,014
Return the jewels.

679
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,313
I'll split the commission he owes me with you.
It'll set you up.

680
01:09:30,609 --> 01:09:33,224
- I can't bring her back, Jason.
- You don't give a fuck!

681
01:09:33,329 --> 01:09:35,461
- You're wrong!
- Yeah?

682
01:09:35,563 --> 01:09:37,503
If you two didn't get ambitious...

683
01:09:37,608 --> 01:09:40,387
she'd be on the front porch sippin'
white wine right now!

684
01:09:40,484 --> 01:09:42,903
It wasn't her!
It was me!

685
01:09:46,908 --> 01:09:49,077
Then you killed her yourself.

686
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:44,162
You cannot expect him
to act normal, Alex.

687
01:10:44,267 --> 01:10:48,735
What about you?
What can I expect from you?

688
01:10:50,817 --> 01:10:52,855
Don't look at me like that.

689
01:10:57,048 --> 01:11:00,177
Did you try to make him feel better?

690
01:11:01,872 --> 01:11:04,741
- Yes, of course.
- Show me.

691
01:11:04,846 --> 01:11:07,426
What?

692
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:10,394
Show me exactly what you did
to try and make him feel better.

693
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:14,773
Stop it, okay? We talked.
I make him breakfast. That's all.

694
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,964
- You slept with him.
- No, I did not.

695
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:22,160
Yeah, you did.
You fucked him!

696
01:11:22,262 --> 01:11:24,714
- You're crazy.
- Where? On the bed?

697
01:11:24,818 --> 01:11:26,984
<i>On the floor?
Up against the wall?</i>

698
01:11:27,087 --> 01:11:29,473
No place, okay?
No place!

699
01:11:29,579 --> 01:11:32,290
At least clean my goddamn sheets!

700
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:34,209
Huh?

701
01:11:39,005 --> 01:11:41,142
Baby, did I hurt you?

702
01:11:43,029 --> 01:11:45,363
Baby, are you all right?

703
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:50,211
I didn't mean to hurt you, baby.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

704
01:11:55,529 --> 01:11:57,434
He's only a kid.

705
01:12:10,512 --> 01:12:14,467
He's a thief.
Him and his mother.

706
01:12:14,569 --> 01:12:17,349
What are you talking about?

707
01:12:17,449 --> 01:12:21,783
<i>Chica, you gotta help me.</i>

708
01:12:47,073 --> 01:12:49,454
Hey, get off my ass.

709
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,577
What? You afraid
I'm gonna use this on you?

710
01:12:54,678 --> 01:12:59,177
I'm sorry that you and your mother-

711
01:12:59,277 --> 01:13:02,655
Don't offer me
your fucking condolences!

712
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:07,161
I was never the mastermind
behind this venture, Jason.

713
01:13:07,266 --> 01:13:09,978
- When we were following you-
- "We"?

714
01:13:12,984 --> 01:13:14,872
Oh.

715
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:18,640
You and Alex.

716
01:13:21,357 --> 01:13:24,201
I already gave the goddamn thing
back to Alex.

717
01:13:25,895 --> 01:13:28,923
Just like that?

718
01:13:29,027 --> 01:13:32,405
Why don't I believe you?

719
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:34,775
I don't give a shit
what you believe.

720
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:37,718
With everything that's happened,
you can have it.

721
01:13:37,814 --> 01:13:40,233
You can choke on it.

722
01:13:44,012 --> 01:13:47,076
Yeah. You assholes
deserve each other.

723
01:14:14,724 --> 01:14:16,606
Alex?

724
01:14:37,185 --> 01:14:40,346
Time to pack.

725
01:14:40,446 --> 01:14:43,160
- Vic.
- Where is it?

726
01:14:43,259 --> 01:14:45,557
What?

727
01:14:48,372 --> 01:14:50,255
The necklace, Alex.

728
01:14:51,407 --> 01:14:53,893
He'll make a move soon, Vic.

729
01:14:58,822 --> 01:15:01,720
He told me he already did.

730
01:15:01,825 --> 01:15:04,721
You talked to Jason?

731
01:15:04,826 --> 01:15:08,205
You think you can cut me out?

732
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:12,396
<i>Try a little family endeavor,
you and Miss Burrito?</i>

733
01:15:12,498 --> 01:15:14,666
What did he say, Vic?

734
01:15:14,765 --> 01:15:18,373
Let me improve your concentration.
This is an acupuncture point.

735
01:15:21,093 --> 01:15:24,832
- Where is it?
- I swear to God, Vic-

736
01:15:24,928 --> 01:15:29,046
I refuse to die
in a fucking prison clinic!

737
01:15:37,454 --> 01:15:40,712
God, Vic, you've lost your mind.

738
01:15:40,811 --> 01:15:44,065
You're not getting enough oxygen
to think good.

739
01:15:46,338 --> 01:15:48,243
This is pitiful.

740
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:52,141
Now just get down here.
What a mess.

741
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:56,619
Lift up. Lift up.
Just lift up.

742
01:16:22,127 --> 01:16:24,776
Oh, Jesus.

743
01:16:36,443 --> 01:16:39,633
Yeah. Yeah.

744
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:10,113
Well, Vic, at least you
got to die in your own clothes.

745
01:17:10,216 --> 01:17:12,126
That's somethin'.

746
01:17:29,232 --> 01:17:31,301
<i>- Any calls?
- Yeah.</i>

747
01:17:31,405 --> 01:17:33,509
Somebody from the police department.

748
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:35,497
<i>It's on your desk.</i>

749
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:42,325
Uh, parking tickets.

750
01:17:42,429 --> 01:17:45,490
<i>No. Somethin' about the Reeses.</i>

751
01:17:56,139 --> 01:17:59,102
<i>Thank you for calling Air France.</i>

752
01:18:02,817 --> 01:18:05,878
<i>For information and reservations
on our next flight...</i>

753
01:18:05,981 --> 01:18:09,108
<i>at 8:00 a. m.
from New York's Kennedy Airport...</i>

754
01:18:09,209 --> 01:18:11,475
<i>please press "2."</i>

755
01:18:11,574 --> 01:18:15,343
<i>For recorded information,
press "3."</i>

756
01:19:49,929 --> 01:19:52,030
Jason.

757
01:19:54,531 --> 01:19:57,660
<i>Wait. I need to talk to you.</i>

758
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,730
We did that already.

759
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:02,582
He stole it from Mrs. Reese.

760
01:20:11,308 --> 01:20:15,163
<i>I used to help her put it on.</i>

761
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:18,082
She couldn't do the hook
with her nails.

762
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:25,420
I always wanted to see what
it would feel like around my neck.

763
01:20:27,574 --> 01:20:29,459
<i>I never did.</i>

764
01:20:29,555 --> 01:20:32,451
<i>Now they're going to blame me.</i>

765
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,487
Move your hair.

766
01:21:12,598 --> 01:21:14,482
It's heavy.

767
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:31,829
They're beautiful.

768
01:21:37,523 --> 01:21:42,599
My mother always say,
"Enough money make any woman beautiful. "

769
01:21:45,032 --> 01:21:46,916
Your mother's wrong.

770
01:21:52,096 --> 01:21:56,595
Jason. Jason, let's just go.

771
01:21:56,695 --> 01:21:58,634
I'm not keeping it.

772
01:22:05,354 --> 01:22:08,798
I'm turning him in...
when I'm ready.

773
01:22:18,427 --> 01:22:20,398
What's this?

774
01:22:20,504 --> 01:22:22,831
<i>There's a stone missing.</i>

775
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:25,132
I bought the boat.

776
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,667
Then don't pretend
you're better than me.

777
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,300
I'm not.

778
01:23:13,899 --> 01:23:16,579
I've gotta pick up some supplies.

779
01:23:16,679 --> 01:23:19,262
I'll be back at the boat
at the end of the day.

780
01:23:19,364 --> 01:23:22,557
- Okay.
- Maybe I'll see you.

781
01:23:24,986 --> 01:23:27,734
It's not so easy for me.

782
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:29,967
I know that.

783
01:24:18,927 --> 01:24:21,991
- Uh-huh.
- I found it.

784
01:24:22,092 --> 01:24:24,899
Good news, baby.

785
01:24:26,819 --> 01:24:29,086
Come quickly.

786
01:24:48,517 --> 01:24:50,621
Are you sure he's not here?

787
01:24:50,722 --> 01:24:52,824
I told you.
He has things to do.

788
01:24:52,927 --> 01:24:54,812
Yeah, right.

789
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:18,928
It's in here.

790
01:25:21,208 --> 01:25:23,725
- It's not here.
- What?

791
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:26,791
- I said it's not here.
- Look on the other side.

792
01:25:42,458 --> 01:25:44,428
Hello, Alex.

793
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:52,201
- You set me up!
- What?

794
01:25:52,298 --> 01:25:55,395
He knew I'd call you.

795
01:25:55,496 --> 01:25:57,695
- You had the choice.
- No, I didn't.

796
01:26:00,225 --> 01:26:03,034
You want it so bad?

797
01:26:06,935 --> 01:26:08,938
Take it.
Get outta here.

798
01:26:10,481 --> 01:26:14,055
The key's in the truck.

799
01:26:15,849 --> 01:26:18,530
Take the fucking thing!

800
01:26:20,645 --> 01:26:22,844
Go. Go!

801
01:26:22,944 --> 01:26:26,287
- He's gonna blow a hole in my guts!
- Don't move!

802
01:26:26,393 --> 01:26:30,667
- Don't do this.
- You did.

803
01:26:30,774 --> 01:26:34,825
No. Not like this.
This is an execution.

804
01:27:35,803 --> 01:27:37,687
Gabby?

805
01:27:39,926 --> 01:27:41,961
Gabby!

806
01:29:05,916 --> 01:29:09,206
Why don't you just
get on the boat and head out.

807
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:11,853
Let me take my chances.

808
01:29:11,954 --> 01:29:14,373
You've taken enough chances already.

809
01:29:16,142 --> 01:29:19,583
You need a doctor.

810
01:29:33,526 --> 01:29:36,040
Oh, my God.

811
01:29:36,144 --> 01:29:39,782
What happened? Alex!

812
01:29:39,881 --> 01:29:41,539
- Help me up.
- No.

813
01:29:41,639 --> 01:29:43,132
- Help me up!
- Please, Alex, don't.

814
01:29:43,238 --> 01:29:45,754
- Please, we can make it to the car, baby.
- Alex, no.

815
01:29:45,858 --> 01:29:49,912
Baby, I knew-
I knew you would- I knew you-

816
01:29:51,801 --> 01:29:54,648
- Take it.
- Huh?

817
01:29:56,082 --> 01:30:00,292
<i>I thought I wanted it, but I don't.</i>

818
01:30:00,397 --> 01:30:03,525
You're not that stupid.

819
01:30:05,193 --> 01:30:07,359
Yes, I am.

820
01:30:15,671 --> 01:30:17,873
<i>You cant just leave him like that.</i>

821
01:30:17,974 --> 01:30:22,026
There's an ambulance on the way.
I'm not waiting.

822
01:30:36,604 --> 01:30:39,152
Neither should you.

823
01:30:42,611 --> 01:30:44,747
You need to hurry.
