{3335}{3394}Mr. Dufresne, describe...
{3400}{3529}...the confrontation you had with|your wife the night she was murdered.
{3670}{3719}It was very bitter.
{3730}{3859}She said she was glad I knew,|that she hated all the sneaking around.
{3906}{4010}And she said that she wanted|a divorce in Reno.
{4018}{4127}-What was your response?|-I told her I would not grant one.
{4134}{4228}"I'll see you in hell|before I see you in Reno."
{4235}{4334}Those were your words,|according to your neighbors.
{4366}{4415}If they say so.
{4431}{4506}I really don't remember.|I was upset.
{4515}{4587}What happened after you argued|with your wife?
{4622}{4675}She packed a bag.
{4711}{4805}She packed a bag to go|and stay with Mr. Quentin.
{4824}{4947}Glenn Quentin, golf pro|at the Snowden Hills Country Club...
{4954}{5047}...whom you had discovered|was your wife 's lover.
{5117}{5152}Did you follow her?
{5192}{5255}I went to a few bars first.
{5261}{5392}Later, I drove to his house|to confront them. They weren't home.
{5409}{5455}I parked in the turnout...
{5477}{5506}...and waited.
{5513}{5562}With what intention?
{5581}{5623}I'm not sure.
{5658}{5701}I was confused...
{5708}{5739}...drunk.
{5785}{5823}I think...
{5830}{5892}...mostly I wanted to scare them.
{5899}{6001}When they arrived, you went up|to the house and murdered them.
{6029}{6071}I was sobering up.
{6077}{6186}I got back in the car|and I drove home to sleep it off.
{6193}{6282}Along the way, I threw my gun|into the Royal River.
{6288}{6347}I've been very clear on this point.
{6354}{6476}I get hazy where the cleaning woman|shows up the following morning...
{6483}{6560}...and finds your wife in bed|with her lover...
{6567}{6629}...riddled with .38-caliber bullets.
{6671}{6796}Does that strike you as a|fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?
{6823}{6853}Yes, it does.
{6859}{6954}Yet you still maintain|you threw your gun into the river...
{6960}{7022}...before the murders took place.
{7028}{7095}That's very convenient.
{7102}{7151}It's the truth.
{7162}{7299}The police dragged that river for|three days, and nary a gun was found...
{7306}{7428}...so no comparison could be made|between your gun and the bullets...
{7434}{7538}...taken from the bloodstained corpses|of the victims.
{7557}{7629}And that also...
{7643}{7746}...is very convenient.|Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?
{7787}{7848}Since I am innocent of this crime...
{7854}{7993}...I find it decidedly inconvenient|that the gun was never found.
{8530}{8630}Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard|all the evidence.
{8637}{8751}We have the accused at the scene|of the crime. We have footprints.
{8757}{8843}Bullets on the ground|bearing his fingerprints.
{8849}{8938}A broken bourbon bottle,|likewise with fingerprints.
{8944}{8991}And most of all...
{8997}{9089}...we have a beautiful young woman|and her lover...
{9095}{9156}...lying dead in each other's arms.
{9192}{9270}They had sinned.
{9306}{9382}But was their crime so great...
{9391}{9456}...as to merit a death sentence?
{9463}{9531}While you think about that...
{9575}{9628}...think about this:
{9654}{9766}A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.
{9772}{9883}I submit that this was not|a hot-blooded crime of passion.
{9890}{9973}That at least could be understood,|if not condoned.
{9980}{10010}No.
{10016}{10050}This was revenge...
{10057}{10189}...of a much more brutal,|cold-blooded nature. Consider this:
{10196}{10268}Four bullets per victim.
{10289}{10341}Not six shots fired, but eight.
{10357}{10464}That means that he fired|the gun empty...
{10472}{10529}...and then stopped to reload...
{10536}{10640}...so that he could shoot|each of them again.
{10646}{10723}An extra bullet per lover...
{10746}{10799}...right in the head.
{10904}{11048}You strike me as a particularly icy|and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.
{11061}{11124}It chills my blood just to look at you.
{11183}{11265}By the power vested in me|by the state of Maine...
{11272}{11399}...I hereby order you to serve|two life sentences back-to-back...
{11411}{11486}...one for each of your victims.|So be it!
{12240}{12274}Sit.
{12410}{12496}We see you've served|20 years of a life sentence?
{12523}{12619}-Yes, sir.|-You feel you've been rehabilitated?
{12632}{12709}Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.
{12743}{12803}I mean, I learned my lesson.
{12835}{12938}I can honestly say|that I'm a changed man.
{13036}{13106}I'm no longer a danger to society.
{13113}{13171}That's God's honest truth.
{14260}{14299}Hey, Red.
{14305}{14343}How'd it go?
{14349}{14414}Same old shit, different day.
{14423}{14478}Yeah, I know how you feel.
{14485}{14544}I'm up for rejection next week.
{14567}{14643}Yeah, I got rejected last week.
{14649}{14688}It happens.
{14694}{14738}Hey, Red, bump me a deck.
{14744}{14842}Get out of my face, man!|You're into me for five packs already.
{14849}{14878}Four!
{14913}{15015}There must be a con like me|in every prison in America.
{15021}{15075}I'm the guy who can get it for you.
{15082}{15174}Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,|if that's your thing...
{15181}{15283}...bottle of brandy to celebrate|your kid's high school graduation.
{15290}{15353}Damn near anything within reason.
{15359}{15471}Yes, sir!|I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.
{15559}{15647}So when Andy Dufresne|came to me in 1949...
{15653}{15760}...and asked me to smuggle|Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...
{15766}{15834}...I told him, "No problem. "
{17090}{17154}Andy came to Shawshank Prison...
{17162}{17278}...in early 1947 for murdering his wife|and the fella she was banging.
{17287}{17409}On the outside, he'd been vice president|of a large Portland bank.
{17423}{17476}Good work for a man so young.
{18772}{18825}You speak English, butt-steak?
{18831}{18888}You follow this officer.
{19270}{19397}I never seen such a sorry-looking|heap of maggot shit in all my life.
{19404}{19482}Hey, fish! Come over here!
{20180}{20221}Taking bets today, Red?
{20233}{20283}Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.
{20290}{20340}Smokes. Put me down for two.
{20356}{20403}All right, who's your horse?
{20409}{20462}That little sack of shit.
{20510}{20608}-Eighth. He'll be first.|-Bullshit! I'll take that action.
{20614}{20680}You're out some smokes, son.
{20687}{20739}If you're so smart, you call it.
{20747}{20838}I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.
{20845}{20922}The fifth one.|Put me down for a quarter deck.
{21018}{21069}Fresh fish today!
{21092}{21136}We're reeling them in!
{21157}{21266}I admit I didn't think much of Andy|first time I laid eyes on him.
{21282}{21369}Looked like a stiff breeze|would blow him over.
{21380}{21443}That was my first impression of the man.
{21449}{21493}What do you say?
{21499}{21597}That tall drink of water|with the silver spoon up his ass.
{21603}{21667}That guy? Never happen.
{21674}{21741}-1 0 cigarettes.|-That's a rich bet.
{21748}{21809}Who's going to prove me wrong?
{21816}{21869}Heywood? Jigger?
{21879}{21917}Skeets?
{21923}{21963}Floyd!
{21992}{22053}Four brave souls.
{22060}{22142}Return to your cellblocks|for evening count.
{22149}{22247}All prisoners,|return to your cellblocks.
{22859}{22892}Turn to the right!
{22898}{22937}Eyes front.
{23329}{23407}This is Mr. Hadley.|He's captain of the guards.
{23414}{23476}I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.
{23483}{23548}You are convicted felons.
{23557}{23617}That's why they've sent you to me.
{23634}{23676}Rule number one:
{23682}{23727}No blasphemy.
{23742}{23845}I'll not have the Lord's name|taken in vain in my prison.
{23851}{23887}The other rules...
{23893}{23992}...you'll figure out as you go along.|Any questions?
{24003}{24035}When do we eat?
{24296}{24356}You eat when we say you eat.
{24362}{24460}You shit when we say you shit,|and piss when we say you piss.
{24466}{24551}You got that,|you maggot-dick motherfucker?
{24608}{24648}On your feet.
{24654}{24707}I believe in two things:
{24713}{24787}Discipline and the Bible.
{24802}{24864}Here, you'll receive both.
{24888}{24952}Put your trust in the Lord.
{24970}{25037}Your ass belongs to me.
{25093}{25149}Welcome to Shawshank.
{25304}{25345}Unhook them.
{25508}{25550}Turn around.
{25755}{25797}That's enough.
{25824}{25884}Move to the end of the cage.
{25915}{25990}Turn around. Delouse him.
{26055}{26092}Turn around.
{26177}{26258}Move out of the cage.|Pick up your clothes and Bible.
{26264}{26304}Next man up!
{26373}{26416}To the right.
{26423}{26454}Right. Right.
{26471}{26508}Left.
{26521}{26634}The first night's the toughest.|No doubt about it.
{26647}{26741}They march you in|naked as the day you were born...
{26747}{26861}...skin burning and half-blind|from that delousing shit.
{26881}{26953}And when they put you in that cell...
{26959}{27029}...and those bars slam home...
{27044}{27109}...that's when you know it's for real.
{27128}{27217}Old life blown away|in the blink of an eye.
{27232}{27355}Nothing left but all the time|in the world to think about it.
{27388}{27490}Most new fish come close to madness|the first night.
{27499}{27588}Somebody always breaks down crying.
{27602}{27652}Happens every time.
{27680}{27733}The only question is...
{27739}{27792}...who's it going to be?
{27834}{27923}It's as good a thing|to bet on as any, I guess.
{27954}{28034}I had my money on Andy Dufresne.
{28304}{28354}Lights out!
{28969}{29039}I remember my first night.
{29064}{29153}Seems like a long time ago.
{29249}{29297}Hey, fish.
{29328}{29382}Fish, fish.
{29429}{29482}What are you, scared of the dark?
{29552}{29633}Bet you wish your daddy|never dicked your mama!
{29640}{29742}Piggy! Pork!|I want me a pork chop.
{29993}{30089}The boys always go fishing|with first-timers.
{30100}{30187}And they don't quit|till they reel someone in.
{30229}{30277}Hey, Fat Ass.
{30323}{30362}Fat Ass!
{30397}{30449}Talk to me, boy.
{30480}{30552}I know you're there.|I can hear you breathing.
{30558}{30647}Don't you listen to these nitwits,|you hear me?
{30653}{30709}This place ain't so bad.
{30722}{30759}Tell you what...
{30798}{30890}...I'll introduce you around,|make you feel right at home.
{30908}{30997}I know a couple of|big old bull queers that'd just...
{31004}{31063}...love to make your acquaintance.
{31069}{31173}Especially that big, white,|mushy butt of yours.
{31179}{31212}God!
{31232}{31274}I don't belong here!
{31280}{31366}-We have a winner!|-I want to go home!
{31374}{31453}And it's Fat Ass by a nose!
{31538}{31589}Fresh fish!
{31773}{31827}I want to go home!
{31856}{31893}I want my mother!
{31901}{31966}I had your mother!|She wasn't that great!
{32097}{32157}What the Christ is this horseshit?
{32163}{32226}He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.
{32233}{32304}You'll tell him|with my baton up your ass!
{32310}{32335}Let me out!
{32341}{32444}What is your malfunction,|you fat barrel of monkey spunk?
{32450}{32539}Please! I ain't supposed to be here.
{32554}{32586}Not me!
{32592}{32662}I won't count to three.|Not even to one.
{32669}{32730}You shut up,|or I'll sing you a lullaby!
{32744}{32826}Shut up, man. Shut up!
{32848}{32928}You don't understand.|I'm not supposed to be here.
{32934}{32973}Open that cell.
{32979}{33077}Me neither! They run this place|like a fucking prison!
{33312}{33362}Son of a bitch!
{33510}{33579}Captain, take it easy!
{34250}{34348}If I hear so much as a mouse fart|in here tonight...
{34354}{34458}...I swear by God and Jesus,|you will all visit the infirmary.
{34473}{34542}Every last motherfucker in here.
{34645}{34754}Call the trustees. Take that|tub of shit down to the infirmary.
{35185}{35323}His first night in the joint, Dufresne|cost me two packs of cigarettes.
{35329}{35419}He never made a sound.
{35880}{35949}Tier 3 north, clear count!
{35976}{36031}Tier 2 north, clear count.
{36047}{36117}Tier 3 south, clear.
{36262}{36309}Prepare to roll out.
{36418}{36462}Roll out!
{38079}{38143}Are you going to eat that?
{38162}{38231}I hadn't planned on it.
{38263}{38300}Do you mind?
{38557}{38599}That's nice and ripe.
{38952}{39013}Jake says thank you.
{39029}{39123}Fell out of his nest|over by the plate shop.
{39166}{39267}I'm going to look after him|until he's big enough to fly.
{39311}{39356}Oh, no! Here he comes.
{39455}{39498}Morning, fellas.
{39505}{39564}Fine morning, isn't it?
{39573}{39640}You know why it's a fine morning,|don't you?
{39648}{39715}Send them down.|I want them lined up...
{39724}{39800}...just like a pretty little|chorus line.
{39834}{39869}Look at that.
{39885}{39980}-I can't stand this guy.|-Oh, Lord!
{40000}{40075}Yes! Richmond, Virginia.
{40081}{40121}Smell my ass!
{40128}{40187}After he smells mine.
{40200}{40311}That's a shame about your horse|coming in last and all.
{40318}{40402}But I sure do love|that winning horse of mine, though.
{40408}{40484}I owe that boy a big kiss|when I see him.
{40503}{40630}Why don't you give him some of your|cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!
{40639}{40685}Hey, Tyrell.
{40695}{40755}You pull infirmary duty this week?
{40784}{40831}How's my horse doing anyway?
{40844}{40877}Dead.
{40903}{40968}Hadley busted his head up pretty good.
{40975}{41040}Doc had gone home for the night.
{41055}{41123}Poor bastard lay there|till this morning.
{41129}{41203}By then, there wasn't nothing|we could do.
{41393}{41431}What was his name?
{41533}{41570}What'd you say?
{41628}{41699}I was just wondering|if anyone knew his name.
{41720}{41802}What the fuck do you care, new fish?
{41833}{41926}Doesn't fucking matter|what his name was. He's dead.
{42587}{42647}Anybody come at you yet?
{42712}{42766}Anybody get to you yet?
{42816}{42892}Hey, we all need friends in here.
{42902}{42951}I could be a friend to you.
{43227}{43269}Hard to get.
{43333}{43377}I like that.
{43585}{43682}Andy kept pretty much|to himself at first.
{43692}{43752}I guess he had a lot on his mind...
{43764}{43849}...trying to adapt|to life on the inside.
{43871}{43967}Wasn't until a month went by|before he opened his mouth...
{43974}{44044}...to say more than two words|to somebody.
{44081}{44127}As it turned out...
{44141}{44197}...that somebody was me.
{44460}{44513}I'm Andy Dufresne.
{44551}{44602}Wife-killing banker.
{44670}{44709}Why'd you do it?
{44723}{44784}I didn't, since you ask.
{44803}{44857}You're going to fit right in.
{44864}{44944}Everybody in here's innocent.|Didn't you know that?
{44964}{45059}-What you in here for?|-Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.
{45151}{45227}Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.
{45234}{45341}You think your shit smells|sweeter than most. Is that right?
{45347}{45391}What do you think?
{45403}{45494}To tell you the truth,|I haven't made up my mind.
{45528}{45612}I understand you're a man|that knows how to get things.
{45641}{45740}I'm known to locate certain things|from time to time.
{45746}{45823}I wonder if you might get me|a rock hammer.
{45844}{45883}A rock hammer.
{45894}{45974}-What is it and why?|-What do you care?
{46015}{46096}For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask.|I'd quote a price.
{46102}{46176}But a toothbrush|is a non-lethal object, isn't it?
{46223}{46265}Fair enough.
{46277}{46356}A rock hammer is about|six or seven inches long.
{46363}{46432}-Looks like a miniature pickax.|-Pickax?
{46438}{46474}For rocks.
{46553}{46589}Quartz?
{46707}{46811}And some mica, shale...
{46848}{46886}...limestone.
{46894}{46927}So?
{46955}{47010}So I'm a rock hound.
{47023}{47116}At least I was in my old life.|I'd like to be again.
{47124}{47218}Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy|into somebody's skull.
{47263}{47309}No, I have no enemies here.
{47316}{47384}No? Wait a while.
{47433}{47481}Word gets around.
{47501}{47576}The Sisters have taken|quite a liking to you.
{47617}{47671}Especially Bogs.
{47702}{47804}Don't suppose it would help if l|told them I'm not homosexual.
{47810}{47854}Neither are they.
{47860}{47963}You have to be human first.|They don't qualify.
{48098}{48231}Bull queers take by force.|That's all they want or understand.
{48237}{48342}If I were you, I'd grow eyes|in the back of my head.
{48348}{48431}-Thanks for the advice.|-Well, that's free.
{48442}{48501}You understand my concern.
{48507}{48584}If there's trouble,|I won't use the rock hammer.
{48611}{48733}Then I'd guess you want to escape.|Tunnel under the wall, maybe.
{48760}{48810}What did I miss?|What's so funny?
{48822}{48903}You'll understand|when you see the rock hammer.
{48959}{49025}What's an item like this usually go for?
{49031}{49106}Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.
{49122}{49195}My normal markup's 20 percent.
{49202}{49272}But this is a specialty item.
{49279}{49412}Risk goes up, price goes up.|Let's make it an even 1 0 bucks.
{49419}{49458}Ten it is.
{49511}{49571}Waste of money, if you ask me.
{49579}{49618}Why's that?
{49660}{49751}Folks around this joint|love surprise inspections.
{49799}{49859}They find it, you're going to lose it.
{49865}{49927}If they catch you, you don't know me.
{49933}{50000}Mention my name, we never|do business again.
{50016}{50108}Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.|Now you got that?
{50133}{50180}I understand.
{50216}{50279}Thank you, Mr....
{50286}{50316}Red.
{50338}{50377}Name's Red.
{50420}{50469}Why do they call you that?
{50583}{50642}Maybe it's because I'm Irish.
{50887}{50973}I could see why some of the boys|took him for snobby.
{50999}{51072}He had a quiet way about him...
{51082}{51207}...a walk and a talk that just|wasn't normal around here.
{51217}{51261}He strolled...
{51267}{51393}...like a man in the park without a care|or a worry in the world.
{51400}{51539}Like he had on an invisible coat|that would shield him from this place.
{51597}{51664}I think it'd be fair to say...
{51673}{51739}...I liked Andy from the start.
{51786}{51899}Let's go! Some of us|got a schedule to keep.
{52000}{52074}Move it! Come on, move it!
{52152}{52241}How you doing?|How's the wife treating you?
{53384}{53427}Andy was right.
{53435}{53501}I finally got the joke.
{53510}{53582}It would take a man about 600 years...
{53589}{53662}...to tunnel under the wall|with one of these.
{53776}{53848}-Book?|-Not today.
{54029}{54059}Book?
{54279}{54344}Delivery for Dufresne.
{54875}{54922}Here's your book.
{55072}{55109}Thanks.
{55297}{55408}We're running low on hexite.|Get on back and fetch us up some.
{56527}{56573}This will blind you.
{56584}{56656}Honey, hush.
{57032}{57091}That's it. You fight!
{57097}{57142}Better that way.
{57388}{57481}I wish I could tell you|Andy fought the good fight...
{57487}{57547}...and the Sisters let him be.
{57564}{57619}I wish I could tell you that...
{57626}{57715}...but prison is no fairy-tale world.
{57748}{57807}He never said who did it.
{57814}{57862}But we all knew.
{58007}{58082}Things went on like that for a while.
{58095}{58169}Prison life consists of routine...
{58178}{58236}...and then more routine.
{58312}{58417}Every so often, Andy would show up|with fresh bruises.
{58461}{58516}The Sisters kept at him.
{58523}{58585}Sometimes he was able|to fight them off.
{58591}{58636}Sometimes not.
{58671}{58736}And that's how it went for Andy.
{58753}{58806}That was his routine.
{58832}{58934}I do believe those first two years|were the worst for him.
{58949}{59050}And I also believe that|if things had gone on that way...
{59061}{59133}...this place would have|got the best of him.
{59156}{59240}But then, in the spring of 1949...
{59246}{59303}...the powers that be decided:
{59310}{59409}The roof of the license-plate factory|needs resurfacing.
{59415}{59511}I need a dozen volunteers|for a week's work.
{59533}{59576}As you know...
{59598}{59705}...special detail carries with it|special privileges.
{59711}{59783}It was outdoor detail...
{59795}{59923}...and May is one damned fine month|to be working outdoors.
{59931}{59970}Stay in line there.
{59976}{60071}More than a hundred men|volunteered for the job.
{60199}{60289}Wallace E. Unger.
{60305}{60375}Ellis Redding.
{60382}{60428}Wouldn't you know it?
{60442}{60540}Me and some fellows I know|were among the names called.
{60546}{60606}Andrew Dufresne.
{60618}{60706}It only cost us|a pack of smokes per man.
{60721}{60795}I made my usual 20 percent, of course.
{60801}{60905}So this big-shot lawyer|calls me long-distance from Texas.
{60911}{60958}I say, "Yeah?"
{60966}{61075}He says, "Sorry to inform you,|but your brother just died."
{61081}{61198}-I'm sorry to hear that.|-I'm not. He was an asshole.
{61205}{61270}Ran off years ago.|Figured him for dead.
{61276}{61345}So this lawyer fellow says to me:
{61351}{61475}"He died a rich man." Oil wells|and shit. Close to a million bucks.
{61496}{61551}A million bucks?
{61560}{61695}-Incredible how lucky some assholes get.|-You going to see any of that?
{61713}{61796}Thirty-five thousand.|That's what he left me.
{61802}{61838}Dollars?
{61860}{61950}That's great! That's like|winning the sweepstakes.
{61960}{61993}Isn't it?
{61999}{62088}Dumb shit, what do you think|the government will do to me?
{62094}{62165}Take a big wet bite|out of my ass is what.
{62188}{62228}Poor Byron.
{62255}{62350}Terrible fucking luck, huh?|Crying shame.
{62356}{62424}Some people really got it awful.
{62432}{62473}Andy, are you nuts?
{62479}{62536}Keep your eyes on your mop, man!
{62542}{62631}You'll pay some tax,|but you'll still end up--
{62637}{62721}Yeah, maybe enough to buy|a new car, and then what?
{62727}{62792}I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...
{62800}{62911}...maintenance, kids pestering you|to take them for a ride all the time.
{62919}{63028}Then if you figure your tax wrong,|you pay out of your own pocket.
{63035}{63098}I tell you! Uncle Sam!
{63106}{63225}He puts his hand in your shirt|and squeezes your tit till it's purple.
{63305}{63369}-Getting himself killed.|-Keep tarring.
{63376}{63452}Some brother.|Shit!
{63600}{63642}Mr. Hadley...
{63668}{63709}...do you trust your wife?
{63758}{63802}Oh, that's funny.
{63819}{63896}You'll look funnier|sucking my dick with no teeth.
{63903}{64003}What I mean is, do you think|she'd go behind your back?
{64037}{64138}Step aside, Mert. This fucker's|having himself an accident.
{64146}{64176}He'll push him off!
{64184}{64238}If you trust her, you can keep...
{64245}{64287}...that 35,000.
{64309}{64384}-What did you say?|-Thirty-five thousand.
{64410}{64440}All of it.
{64446}{64538}-Every penny.|-You better start making sense.
{64544}{64614}If you want to keep it,|give it to your wife.
{64621}{64737}The IRS allows a one-time-only gift|to your spouse for up to $60,000.
{64743}{64814}-Bullshit. Tax-free?|-Tax-free.
{64820}{64879}IRS can't touch one cent.
{64891}{64965}You're that smart banker|that killed his wife.
{64972}{65073}Why should I believe you?|So I can end up in here with you?
{65079}{65164}It's legal. Ask the IRS.|They'll say the same thing.
{65170}{65292}I feel stupid telling you this.|I'm sure you would have investigated.
{65298}{65408}I don't need you to tell me|where the bear shit in the buckwheat.
{65414}{65516}Of course not. But you do need|someone to set it up for you.
{65522}{65569}That'll cost you. A lawyer.
{65575}{65643}A bunch of ball-washing bastards!
{65657}{65761}I suppose I could set it up for you.|That would save you some money.
{65767}{65829}You get the forms, I'll prepare them...
{65836}{65888}...nearly free of charge.
{65925}{66024}I'd only ask three beers apiece|for each of my coworkers.
{66053}{66099}"Coworkers." That's rich!
{66124}{66200}A man working outdoors|feels more like a man...
{66207}{66310}...if he can have a bottle of suds.|That's only my opinion...
{66323}{66353}...sir.
{66471}{66529}What are you jimmies staring at?
{66535}{66583}Let's go! Work!
{66869}{66926}And that's how it came to pass...
{66932}{67012}...that on the second-to-last|day of the job...
{67018}{67155}...the convict crew that tarred|the factory roof in the spring of '49...
{67161}{67255}...wound up sitting in a row|at 10:00 in the morning...
{67261}{67425}...drinking icy-cold beer,|courtesy of the hardest screw...
{67431}{67529}...that ever walked a turn|at Shawshank State Prison.
{67535}{67608}Drink up while it's cold, ladies.
{67642}{67778}The colossal prick even managed|to sound magnanimous.
{67812}{67946}We sat and drank with the sun|on our shoulders and felt like free men.
{67957}{68060}We could have been tarring|the roof of one of our own houses.
{68066}{68151}We were the lords of all creation.
{68168}{68216}As for Andy...
{68224}{68302}...he spent that break|hunkered in the shade...
{68308}{68383}...a strange little smile on his face...
{68390}{68456}...watching us drink his beer.
{68699}{68740}Want a cold one?
{68760}{68848}No, thanks. I gave up drinking.
{68967}{69059}You could argue he done it|to curry favor with the guards.
{69080}{69194}Or maybe make a few friends|among us cons.
{69216}{69248}Me?
{69254}{69338}I think he did it|just to feel normal again...
{69351}{69418}...if only for a short while.
{69498}{69530}King me.
{69587}{69665}-Chess. Now there's a game of kings.|-What?
{69671}{69723}Civilized. Strategic.
{69743}{69833}And a total fucking mystery.|I hate it.
{69841}{69894}Let me teach you someday.
{69941}{69970}Sure.
{69985}{70036}We could get a board together.
{70043}{70135}You're talking to the right man.|I can get things, right?
{70141}{70261}We might do business on a board,|and I'll carve the pieces myself.
{70267}{70366}One side in alabaster, one in soapstone.|What do you think?
{70384}{70426}I think it'll take years.
{70432}{70508}Years I got.|What I don't have are the rocks.
{70514}{70573}Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.
{70579}{70634}Pebbles, mostly.
{70764}{70848}We're getting to be|kind of friends, aren't we?
{70874}{70921}Yeah, I guess.
{70940}{70986}Can I ask you something?
{71031}{71073}Why'd you do it?
{71111}{71157}I'm innocent, Red.
{71163}{71224}Just like everybody else here.
{71354}{71401}What are you in for?
{71482}{71547}Murder. Same as you.
{71553}{71588}Innocent?
{71669}{71741}Only guilty man in Shawshank.
{73520}{73564}Where's the canary?
{73570}{73609}How did you know?
{73615}{73684}-How did I know what?|-So you don't know.
{73690}{73725}Come.
{73800}{73863}This is where the canary is.
{73943}{74043}Quite a surprise to hear|a woman singing in my house, eh?
{74148}{74190}That's quite a...
{74218}{74268}...surprise.
{74397}{74439}Wait, wait.
{74455}{74500}Here she comes.
{74509}{74594}I like this part when she|does that shit with her hair.
{74601}{74682}I know. I've seen it|three times this month.
{74688}{74745}Gilda, are you decent?
{74776}{74809}Me?
{74890}{74943}God, I love it.
{75098}{75188}I understand you're a man|that knows how to get things.
{75219}{75330}I'm known to locate certain things|from time to time. What do you want?
{75336}{75400}-Rita Hayworth.|-What?
{75418}{75458}Can you get her?
{75501}{75601}So this is Johnny Farrel.|I've heard a lot about you.
{75638}{75707}-Take a few weeks.|-Weeks?
{75713}{75846}I don't have her stuffed down the front|of my pants right now, sorry to say.
{75862}{75902}But I'll get her.
{75908}{75948}Relax.
{76004}{76043}Thanks.
{76660}{76713}-Get out!|-I got to change reels!
{76720}{76780}I said fuck off!
{76964}{77005}Ain't you going to scream?
{77045}{77101}Let's get this over with.
{77254}{77314}He broke my fucking nose!
{77593}{77630}Now...
{77644}{77709}...I'm going to open my fly...
{77717}{77800}...and you'll swallow|what I give you to swallow.
{77834}{77912}Then you'll swallow Rooster's.|You broke his nose.
{77919}{77982}He ought to have|something to show for it.
{77988}{78044}You put it in my mouth,|you lose it.
{78050}{78128}No, you don't understand.
{78139}{78229}Do that and I'll put all eight inches|of this in your ear.
{78235}{78339}All right, but you should know|that sudden, serious brain injury...
{78345}{78403}...causes the victim to bite down hard.
{78409}{78514}In fact, I hear the bite reflex|is so strong...
{78538}{78612}...they have to pry|the victim's jaws open...
{78618}{78659}...with a crowbar.
{78748}{78794}Where do you get this shit?
{78801}{78843}I read it.
{78884}{78964}You know how to read,|you ignorant fuck?
{79015}{79047}Honey!
{79105}{79157}You shouldn't!
{79238}{79324}Bogs didn't put anything|in Andy's mouth.
{79333}{79394}And neither did his friends.
{79407}{79522}What they did do is beat him|within an inch of his life.
{79542}{79617}Andy spent a month in the infirmary.
{79642}{79717}Bogs spent a week in the hole.
{79839}{79885}Time's up, Bogs.
{79999}{80049}It's your world, boss.
{80147}{80231}Return to your cellblocks|for evening count.
{80237}{80317}All prisoners report for lock down.
{80764}{80795}What?
{81174}{81250}-Where's he going?|-Grab his ankles.
{81424}{81462}Help!
{81572}{81650}Two things never happened again|after that.
{81658}{81752}The Sisters never|laid a finger on Andy again.
{81777}{81852}And Bogs would never walk again.
{81887}{81992}They transferred him|to a minimum-security hospital upstate.
{81998}{82081}To my knowledge, he lived out|the rest of his days...
{82087}{82142}...drinking his food through a straw.
{82172}{82295}Andy could use a nice welcome back|when he gets out of the infirmary.
{82347}{82394}Sounds good to us.
{82402}{82477}I figure we owe him that much|for the beer.
{82499}{82567}The man likes to play chess.
{82582}{82639}Let's get him some rocks.
{83617}{83654}Guys!
{83678}{83709}I got one.
{83715}{83760}I got one. Look!
{83818}{83939}Heywood, that isn't soapstone!|And it ain't alabaster either.
{83945}{84002}What are you, a fucking geologist?
{84008}{84060}He's right. It ain't.
{84066}{84153}-What the hell is it then?|-It's a horse apple.
{84183}{84254}-Bullshit!|-No, horseshit.
{84260}{84305}Petrified.
{84575}{84610}Damn!
{84620}{84746}Despite a few hitches,|the boys came through in fine style.
{84752}{84812}And by the weekend|he was due back...
{84819}{84929}...we had enough rocks saved up|to keep him busy till rapture.
{84954}{85029}Also got a big shipment in that week.
{85037}{85071}Cigarettes...
{85077}{85108}...chewing gum...
{85114}{85158}...sipping whisky...
{85164}{85266}...playing cards with naked ladies|on them. You name it.
{85273}{85354}And of course, the most important item:
{85410}{85472}Rita Hayworth herself.
{86584}{86652}Heads up.|They're tossing cells.
{86658}{86739}Heads up.|They're tossing cells!
{86788}{86832}119.
{86887}{86937}123.
{87250}{87275}On your feet.
{87354}{87399}Face the wall.
{88422}{88479}Turn around and face the warden.
{88677}{88739}Pleased to see you reading this.
{88779}{88837}Any favorite passages?
{88863}{88934}"Watch ye, therefore,|for ye know not...
{88940}{89007}...when the master|of the house cometh."
{89041}{89106}Mark 1 3:35.
{89129}{89184}I've always liked that one.
{89212}{89262}But I prefer...
{89277}{89332}..."l am the light of the world.
{89346}{89445}Ye that followeth me|shall have the light of life."
{89451}{89530}John, chapter 8, verse 1 2.
{89538}{89599}I hear you're good with numbers.
{89605}{89635}How nice.
{89672}{89730}Man should have a skill.
{89806}{89837}Explain this.
{89872}{89994}It's called a rock blanket.|It's for shaping and polishing rocks.
{90008}{90064}A little hobby of mine.
{90391}{90433}It's pretty clean.
{90441}{90534}Some contraband here,|but nothing to get in a twist over.
{90664}{90724}I can't say I approve of this.
{90774}{90817}But I suppose...
{90879}{90939}...exceptions can be made.
{91250}{91290}Lock them up!
{91377}{91424}I almost forgot.
{91437}{91502}I'd hate to deprive you of this.
{91524}{91582}Salvation lies within.
{91588}{91620}Yes, sir.
{91876}{91953}Tossing cells was just an excuse.
{91967}{92004}Truth is...
{92010}{92084}...Norton wanted to size Andy up.
{92494}{92564}My wife made that in church group.
{92644}{92683}Very nice, sir.
{92730}{92774}You enjoy working the laundry?
{92824}{92875}No, sir. Not especially.
{92886}{92958}Perhaps we can find something more...
{92966}{93039}...befitting a man of your education.
{93281}{93326}Hey, Jake.|Where's Brooks?
{93382}{93464}I thought I heard you out here.
{93484}{93531}I've been reassigned to you.
{93539}{93609}I know, they told me.
{93634}{93696}Ain't that a kick in the head?
{93703}{93771}Well, I'll give you the dime tour.
{93777}{93812}Come on.
{93854}{93906}Well, here she is.
{93912}{93972}The Shawshank Prison Library.
{93992}{94052}National Geographics...
{94080}{94163}... Reader's Digest condensed books...
{94169}{94217}...and Louis L'Amour.
{94234}{94289}Look magazine.
{94300}{94369}Erle Stanley Gardners.
{94377}{94481}Every evening I load up the cart|and make my rounds.
{94487}{94567}I enter the names|on this clipboard here.
{94582}{94664}Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.
{94686}{94773}-Any questions?|-How long have you been librarian?
{94809}{94930}I come here in '05,|and they made me librarian in 1 9 1 2.
{94969}{95034}And have you ever had an assistant?
{95042}{95114}No. Not much to it, really.
{95137}{95174}Why me? Why now?
{95188}{95226}I don't know.
{95232}{95323}But it'd be nice to have|some company down here.
{95660}{95729}That's him.|That's the one.
{95958}{95993}I'm Dekins.
{96005}{96054}I was thinking...
{96074}{96190}...about setting up some kind of|trust fund for my kids' educations.
{96308}{96351}I see.
{96504}{96593}Why don't we have a seat|and talk it over.
{96689}{96778}Do you have a piece of paper|and a pencil?
{97119}{97157}Thanks.
{97178}{97209}So....
{97262}{97314}Mister Dekins....
{97339}{97402}And then Andy says, "Mr. Dekins...
{97408}{97498}...do you want your sons|to go to Harvard or Yale?"
{97505}{97536}He didn't say that!
{97546}{97621}As God as my witness!
{97629}{97681}Dekins blinked for a second...
{97687}{97781}...then he laughed|and actually shook Andy's hand.
{97794}{97862}-My ass!|-Shook his hand.
{97870}{97956}I tell you, I near soiled myself!
{97962}{98090}All he needed was a suit and tie|and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...
{98096}{98174}...he'd have been|"Mr. Dufresne," if you please.
{98180}{98229}Making a few friends?
{98268}{98318}I wouldn't say "friends."
{98324}{98439}I'm a convicted murderer|who provides sound financial planning.
{98445}{98515}It's a wonderful pet to have.
{98521}{98575}Got you out of the laundry, though.
{98592}{98648}It might do more than that.
{98655}{98736}How about expanding the library.|Get some new books.
{98742}{98820}If you ask for something,|ask for a pool table.
{98871}{98961}How do you expect to do that?|I mean...
{98967}{99056}...get new books in here,|"Mr. Dufresne, if you please."
{99070}{99132}I'll ask the warden for funds.
{99158}{99286}Six wardens have been through here|in my tenure, and I've learned...
{99293}{99362}...one immutable, universal truth:
{99370}{99411}Not one born whose asshole...
{99418}{99565}...wouldn't pucker up tighter than|a snare drum when you ask for funds.
{99591}{99678}-The budget's stretched thin as it is.|-I see.
{99685}{99787}Maybe I could write the state senate|and request funds from them.
{99793}{99916}They have only three ways to spend|the taxpayers' money for prisons:
{99922}{99995}More walls, more bars, more guards.
{100001}{100081}I'd like to try, with permission.|A letter a week.
{100087}{100169}-They can't ignore me forever.|-Sure can.
{100178}{100257}But you write your letters|if it makes you happy.
{100266}{100344}I'll even mail them for you.|How's that?
{100395}{100478}So Andy started writing|a letter a week...
{100484}{100532}...just like he said.
{100657}{100736}And like Norton said...
{100742}{100786}...Andy got no answers.
{101032}{101179}The following April, he did tax returns|for half the guards at Shawshank.
{101219}{101287}Year after that, he did them all...
{101295}{101352}...including the warden's.
{101405}{101508}Year after that, they|rescheduled the intramural season...
{101515}{101587}...to coincide with tax season.
{101634}{101768}The guards on the opposing teams|all remembered to bring their W-2s.
{101774}{101814}So Moresby Prison...
{101820}{101888}...issued you a gun,|but you paid for it.
{101895}{101946}Right. The holster too.
{101952}{102026}That's tax-deductible.|You can write that off.
{102032}{102123}Yes, sir!|Andy was a regular cottage industry.
{102144}{102279}In fact, it got so busy at tax time,|he was allowed a staff.
{102287}{102361}Could you hand me|a stack of 1 040s?
{102367}{102512}Got me out of the wood shop a month out|of the year, and that was fine by me.
{102549}{102644}And still, he kept|sending those letters.
{102847}{102878}It's Brooks.
{102912}{102957}Watch the door.
{102964}{103004}Please, Brooks.
{103012}{103066}-Calm the fuck down.|-Stay back!
{103080}{103158}-Stay back, goddamn it!|-What's going on?
{103164}{103241}One second he's fine,|then out come the knives.
{103247}{103301}We can talk about this, right?
{103309}{103421}There's nothing to talk about.|I'll cut his fucking throat.
{103429}{103481}What's he done to you?
{103487}{103537}It's what they done!
{103552}{103590}I got no choice.
{103604}{103673}You won't hurt Heywood.|We all know that.
{103680}{103753}-Right, Heywood?|-Sure.
{103760}{103860}He's a friend of yours,|and Brooks is a reasonable man.
{103868}{103901}Right, guys?
{103929}{104005}So put the knife down.|Look at me.
{104013}{104079}Put the knife down.
{104137}{104200}Look at his neck, for God's sake.
{104222}{104292}Look at his neck. He's bleeding.
{104319}{104363}It's the only way...
{104369}{104431}...they'd let me stay.
{104439}{104510}This is crazy.|You don't want to do this.
{104518}{104579}Put it, put it down.
{104842}{104887}Take it easy.
{104907}{104954}You'll be all right.
{104985}{105033}Him? What about me?
{105039}{105111}Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!
{105117}{105174}You've had worse from shaving.
{105180}{105243}What did you do to set him off?
{105249}{105316}Nothing.|I come in here to say farewell.
{105334}{105414}Ain't you heard?|His parole's come through.
{105484}{105568}I just don't understand|what happened in there.
{105575}{105658}Old man's crazy as a rat|in a tin shithouse.
{105664}{105721}That's enough out of you.
{105727}{105809}-Heard he had you shitting your pants.|-Fuck you.
{105817}{105853}Knock it off.
{105882}{105925}Brooks ain't no bug.
{106040}{106093}He's just institutionalized.
{106134}{106192}"Institutionalized," my ass.
{106199}{106318}The man's been in here 50 years,|Heywood, 50 years!
{106324}{106376}This is all he knows.
{106383}{106451}In here, he's an important man...
{106457}{106490}...an educated man.
{106514}{106572}Outside, he's nothing.
{106598}{106703}Just a used-up con|with arthritis in both hands.
{106710}{106799}Probably couldn't get a library card|if he tried.
{106808}{106859}You know what I'm trying to say?
{106867}{106954}I do believe|you're talking out of your ass.
{106992}{107059}You believe whatever you want.
{107078}{107149}But I tell you these walls are funny.
{107197}{107247}First you hate them.
{107302}{107359}Then you get used to them.
{107417}{107477}Enough time passes...
{107497}{107557}...you get so you depend on them.
{107587}{107653}That's "institutionalized."
{107659}{107698}Shit.
{107705}{107787}-I could never get like that.|-Oh, yeah?
{107813}{107888}Wait till you've been here|as long as Brooks.
{107895}{107942}Goddamn right.
{108019}{108077}They send you here for life...
{108097}{108167}...that's exactly what they take.
{108219}{108279}Part that counts, anyway.
{108507}{108595}I can't take care of you no more, Jake.
{108630}{108680}You go on now.
{108717}{108762}You're free.
{108801}{108847}You're free.
{109417}{109467}Good luck, Brooksie.
{110605}{110650}Dear fellas:
{110658}{110784}I can't believe how fast things move|on the outside.
{110823}{110903}Watch it, old-timer!|Want to get killed?
{110940}{111045}I saw an automobile once|when I was a kid...
{111064}{111137}...but now they're everywhere.
{111247}{111376}The world went and got itself|in a big damn hurry.
{111850}{111963}The parole board|got me into this halfway house...
{111973}{112022}...called "The Brewer"...
{112028}{112063}...and a job...
{112069}{112158}...bagging groceries at the Food-Way.
{112205}{112277}It's hard work and I try to keep up...
{112283}{112354}...but my hands hurt most of the time.
{112363}{112422}Make sure your man double-bags.
{112428}{112489}Last time, the bottom near came out.
{112509}{112597}Make sure you double-bag|like the lady says. Understand?
{112603}{112644}Yes, sir. Surely will.
{112650}{112756}I don't think the store manager|likes me very much.
{112846}{112975}Sometimes after work,|I go to the park and feed the birds.
{112989}{113033}I keep thinking...
{113040}{113140}...Jake might just show up|and say hello.
{113158}{113218}But he never does.
{113254}{113400}I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay|and making new friends.
{113509}{113590}I have trouble sleeping at night.
{113599}{113697}I have bad dreams like I'm falling.
{113705}{113772}I wake up scared.
{113779}{113905}Sometimes it takes me a while|to remember where I am.
{113950}{114097}Maybe I should get a gun and rob|the Food-Way so they'd send me home.
{114106}{114236}I could shoot the manager while|I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.
{114287}{114406}I guess I'm too old|for that sort of nonsense anymore.
{114413}{114465}I don't like it here.
{114471}{114591}I'm tired of being afraid all the time.|I've decided...
{114616}{114666}...not to stay.
{114994}{115070}I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...
{115077}{115181}...not for an old crook like me.
{117053}{117181}"l doubt they'll kick up any fuss,|not for an old crook like me.
{117212}{117327}P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry|I put a knife to his throat.
{117333}{117403}No hard feelings. Brooks."
{117717}{117776}He should have died in here.
{117942}{117984}What the fuck have you done?
{117991}{118070}It's a goddamn mess,|I'll tell you that.
{118236}{118348}-What's all this?|-You tell me. They're addressed to you.
{118386}{118426}Take it.
{118683}{118727}"Dear Mr. Dufresne:
{118761}{118820}In response to your inquiries...
{118826}{118954}...the state has allocated the enclosed|funds for your library project."
{118977}{119032}This is $200.
{119038}{119158}"In addition, the library district|has generously responded...
{119164}{119241}...with a donation of used books|and sundries.
{119247}{119371}We trust this will fill your needs.|We now consider the matter closed.
{119378}{119431}Please stop sending us letters."
{119438}{119518}Clear all this out|before the warden gets back.
{119525}{119560}Yes, sir.
{119688}{119723}Good for you, Andy.
{119812}{119846}Wow!
{119883}{119940}It only took six years.
{119987}{120069}From now on, I'll write two|letters a week instead of one.
{120076}{120175}I believe you're crazy enough.|Get this stuff out...
{120183}{120208}...like he said.
{120214}{120256}I've got to pinch a loaf.
{120262}{120306}When I come back...
{120312}{120365}...this is all gone, all right?
{121826}{121868}Do you hear that?
{123928}{123963}Dufresne!
{124039}{124085}Andy, let me out!
{124291}{124439}I have no idea to this day what those|two Italian ladies were singing about.
{124448}{124515}Truth is, I don't want to know.
{124521}{124596}Some things are best left unsaid.
{124703}{124785}I like to think it was something|so beautiful...
{124791}{124855}...it can't be expressed in words...
{124861}{124948}...and makes your heart ache|because of it.
{124998}{125073}I tell you, those voices soared...
{125081}{125210}...higher and farther than anybody|in a gray place dares to dream.
{125216}{125317}It was like a beautiful bird|flapped into our drab cage...
{125323}{125406}...and made those walls dissolve away.
{125419}{125485}And for the briefest of moments...
{125491}{125581}...every last man at Shawshank|felt free.
{125658}{125738}It pissed the warden off|something awful.
{125777}{125807}Open the door.
{125895}{125947}Open it up!
{125987}{126068}Dufresne, open this door!
{126108}{126144}Turn that off!
{126356}{126429}I am warning you. Turn that off!
{126961}{127007}You're mine now.
{127230}{127327}Andy got two weeks in the hole|for that little stunt.
{127333}{127381}On your feet.
