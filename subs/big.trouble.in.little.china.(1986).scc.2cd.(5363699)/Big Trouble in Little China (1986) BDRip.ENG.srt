1
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:14,005
<i>What I'd like to do today is
get your version of what happened.</i>

2
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:17,205
- You mean the truth?
- Of course.

3
00:00:17,905 --> 00:00:21,805
First, just state your name and
your occupation for the record.

4
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,505
Egg Shen, bus driver.

5
00:00:25,305 --> 00:00:29,205
Bus driver.
What kind of bus and where, please?

6
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:36,005
Tour bus. Bus for tourists.
San Francisco Chinatown.

7
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:42,205
Thank you.
Now, before we get to the meat of this thing,

8
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:45,705
do you at the present time
have any knowledge

9
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:48,605
of the whereabouts of
a Mr Jack Burton or his truck?

10
00:00:48,805 --> 00:00:52,405
- Oh, God. Will you leave him alone?
- Mr Shen, please.

11
00:00:52,605 --> 00:00:58,605
You could be in a great deal of trouble. Half
a city block explodes in a ball of green flame.

12
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:01,957
Green flame! All hell is breaking loose here.

13
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:04,505
And there are people
who say you're involved,

14
00:01:04,705 --> 00:01:09,605
that you might be responsible,
that you're a very dangerous man.

15
00:01:09,905 --> 00:01:14,405
- Now, if you're protecting Jack Burton...
- You leave Jack Burton alone!

16
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:19,705
We are in his debt. He showed great courage.

17
00:01:25,205 --> 00:01:27,905
OK.

18
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:31,705
But if I'm gonna be your attorney,
there are a few things I have to know

19
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:36,305
that still don't make any sense to me.
Like...

20
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,605
do you really believe in magic?

21
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:43,205
You mean Chinese black magic?

22
00:01:43,405 --> 00:01:46,305
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

23
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:51,805
Are you still serious about this? And
monsters and ghosts as well, I suppose?

24
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:55,205
Sure. And sorcery.

25
00:01:56,405 --> 00:02:01,705
And I suppose that you expect me
to believe in sorcery as well?

26
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:04,405
- Of course.
- Why?

27
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:06,805
Because it's real.

28
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:13,005
How can I know that, Mr Shen?
- How?
- Yes, how? Help me out here.

29
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:15,505
Please.

30
00:02:22,105 --> 00:02:24,705
See? That was nothing.

31
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:29,005
But that's how it always begins.

32
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:31,505
Very small.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,074

34
00:02:55,105 --> 00:03:00,005
<i>This is Jack Burton at the Pork-Chop Express
and I'm talkin' to whoever's listenin'.</i>

35
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:05,405
It's like I told my last wife.
I says "Honey,
I never drive faster than I can see."

36
00:03:05,705 --> 00:03:09,505
"Besides that, it's all in the reflexes."

37
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:20,605
You just listen to the Pork-Chop Express and
take his advice on a dark and stormy night.

38
00:03:20,905 --> 00:03:23,757
When some wild-eyed maniac
grabs your neck,

39
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:26,705
taps the back of your head
up against a barroom wall,

40
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:30,805
he looks you crooked in the eye
and asks you if you've paid your dues,

41
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:36,705
you just stare that big sucker back in the eye
and remember what Jack Burton always says.

42
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:41,905
"Have you paid your dues, Jack?"
"Yes, sir, the cheque is in the mail."

43
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:04,205
Well, you see, I'm not sayin' that I've been
everywhere and I've done everything.

44
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:08,405
But I do know it's a pretty
amazing planet we live on here,

45
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:13,905
and a man would have to be some kinda fool
to think we're all alone in this universe.

46
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:39,905
I can't believe you're stuck on even.
This is odd!
All right, even! Another even! Come on!

47
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:43,005
You want one more? All right!

48
00:05:48,005 --> 00:05:50,805
- What do we got? He can't count.
- Even!

49
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:54,705
Learn how to play some fan-tan here,
buddy-boy!

50
00:05:54,905 --> 00:05:57,105
Three!

51
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:20,005
Heaven and earth, boys. What can I tell ya?

52
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:27,105
You like that one?
What did he say, Wang? In English?

53
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:31,005
Something about beginner's luck.
It doesn't translate. But he quits.

54
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:37,005
He quits? What is this? It's a brand-new day
and he's still got 100 bucks in his pocket.

55
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:42,005
I'm not gonna complain, because I'll bet
I'd have lost my shirt in the next 20 minutes.

56
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:45,305
Breaks my heart to do this,
but the next time I'm down here,

57
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:49,305
you'll gang up on Jack so fast
he won't know what the hell happened.

58
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:53,205
- No.
- Ah, sure. Easy come, easy go, Wang.
No!

59
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:58,005
Not next time. Now.

60
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:03,305
Is this gonna get ugly now? I hope not.

61
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:06,605
I thought what we were here,
racial differences aside,

62
00:07:06,905 --> 00:07:10,305
was a coupla old friends,
both of us Californians.

63
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:13,005
Shit, Wang. It's only a game.

64
00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:18,605
Nothin' or double.

65
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,705
This knife cuts this bottle in half.

66
00:07:23,905 --> 00:07:25,057
- Nothin' or double.
- Bullshit.

67
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:27,605
- Nothin' or double.
- Why, man? Don't be stupid.

68
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:33,005
- I need the money.
- I got near a thousand bucks here, Wang.
1,148, Jack.

69
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:42,005
OK. But not that bottle.

70
00:07:44,905 --> 00:07:46,305
This bottle.

71
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,905
OK.

72
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:56,005
You're outta your mind, Wang. God bless ya!

73
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:11,005
- It's all in the reflexes.
- It always works at home.

74
00:08:11,205 --> 00:08:16,705
Have me over for dinner some year and prove
it. In the meantime, pay up: $1,148 times two.

75
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:19,805
- I don't have that kind of money.
- I didn't hear that.

76
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:25,105
- I'm just a poor Chinese boy, you know?
- You own a restaurant. That's more than me.

77
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:30,005
Yeah, right. What I meant was,
I don't got that kind of money on me.

78
00:08:30,305 --> 00:08:33,105
That's what I thought you meant.
Where's your truck?

79
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:35,605
- I gotta go somewhere.
- No, you don't.

80
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:39,005
I do. How about we meet in my restaurant
in a few hours? I pay then.

81
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:41,805
- You pay now. Where you gotta go?
- The airport.

82
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:45,205
- Yeah, right. Over my dead body.
- If need be.

83
00:08:46,805 --> 00:08:50,457
- I'll follow you.
- You don't trust me? That makes me sad.

84
00:08:50,605 --> 00:08:54,405
- It reminds me of an old Chinese joke.
- Save it. I'll give you a lift. Get in.

85
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:58,905
- You were gonna follow me, Jack.
- I know, then I came to my senses.

86
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,705
- So who are we pickin' up?
- A girl. I don't wanna talk about it.

87
00:09:02,905 --> 00:09:05,205
- A girl? Where from?
- Peking.

88
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:09,905
This is a big day in my life. I should
have gone home and gotten 40 winks.

89
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:12,705
A girl from China? All right, I never done that.

90
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:17,505
I picked up girls from everywhere else,
but never from China. Is she pretty?

91
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:22,405
- I'm gonna marry her, Jack.
- Oh, God!

92
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:26,605
I've known her since we were kids.
I haven't seen her in five years.

93
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:29,605
I came here alone.
I worked my fingers till they bled.

94
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:31,705
Before you knew me, I slept on the floor.

95
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,105
I saved every nickel to bring her here
because I love her so much.

96
00:09:35,405 --> 00:09:41,305
I can't eat, sleep or think properly without her
any more. She'll put my whole life in order.

97
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:44,205
Boy, listen to me. Real tough guy.

98
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:47,305
You sound a little nervous, pal.

99
00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:53,305
That's why the bottle didn't slice. My mind
and my spirit are goin' north and south.

100
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:06,105
<i>Flight number 26 has just arrived
at gate number seven.</i>

101
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:13,805
Whoa. Who is that?

102
00:10:15,205 --> 00:10:17,905
She has green eyes.
You know how rare that is, Jack?

103
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:22,705
- How can you tell from here?
- Not her. She's trouble. Miao Yin.

104
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:26,505
Beautiful green eyes, like creamy jade.

105
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:28,605
Trouble, huh?

106
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:44,505
- Can I ask you a serious question?
- Absolutely not.

107
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:49,005
- Would you considerjumping right into...
- Sure, but not with a man in your condition.

108
00:10:49,305 --> 00:10:53,605
- What's wrong with my condition?
- Try standing downwind where I am.

109
00:10:53,905 --> 00:10:57,905
- It's Miller time.
- You know what I say when it's Miller time?

110
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:01,705
Wait a minute!

111
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:04,205
- Don't!
- Don't what?

112
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:09,805
The Lords of Death. Street gang. Punks
from Chinatown. What are they doing here?

113
00:11:44,105 --> 00:11:45,705
Tara!

114
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:51,605
Miao Yin!

115
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:03,405
Excuse me.

116
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:14,605
Let's you and me have a little talk, friend.
What?

117
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:16,905
Where'd you get that?

118
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:26,605
Wait a minute, pal.

119
00:12:28,805 --> 00:12:30,205
Get that one!

120
00:12:37,805 --> 00:12:40,005
Come on, Jack!

121
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:58,405
Where?

122
00:12:59,705 --> 00:13:01,805
Call the cops!

123
00:13:23,905 --> 00:13:26,105
Son of a bitch must pay!

124
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:33,005
What's goin' on, Wang?
Why'd they steal your girl?

125
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:37,505
You tell me! How come it's not safe to walk
in Central Park or to give a stranger a lift?

126
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:43,105
- Because the world's full of crazy people.
- The American girl knew something was up.

127
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:48,505
Stay away from her. She's a lawyer.
She's a what? Oh, come on!

128
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:52,905
- What the hell...?
- They got a clubhouse where they hang out.

129
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:55,205
- To sharpen their knives?
- I can't ask you to...

130
00:13:55,405 --> 00:13:57,805
- Where is it?
- Thank you, Jack.

131
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:08,205
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
I am Mr Egg Shen, with this wonderful tour.

132
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:11,105
Sit back and enjoy yourselves, see?

133
00:14:11,305 --> 00:14:16,705
Long time ago, Chinese men with
gold-rush fever flooded into California.

134
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:20,405
<i>We call Gum Shan - Mountain of Gold, see?</i>

135
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:23,705
Leaving behind their wives and children.

136
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:28,305
Working for years to complete
the transcontinental railroad,

137
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:32,805
saving all their pennies.
And then they sent for their families

138
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:39,905
to help build this beautiful Chinatown
you see outside your window
this fine warm day.

139
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:15,105
- Go right, down that alley. Lords of Death!
- What alley?
Go right! Now!

140
00:15:36,605 --> 00:15:39,405
- Where the hell are we?
- Come on, Jack.

141
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:45,605
Excuse me, ma'am.
I don't suppose you saw a...

142
00:15:50,005 --> 00:15:51,705
No.

143
00:15:51,905 --> 00:15:54,005
Keep moving.

144
00:16:21,405 --> 00:16:23,505
- What is it? A parade?
- A funeral.

145
00:16:23,705 --> 00:16:27,205
- A fighting tong. They're Chang Sings.
- A fighting tong?

146
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:31,305
Don't panic, Jack.
They're OK. They're good guys.

147
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:36,105
Maybe we should try a different alley.
What do you say?

148
00:16:42,105 --> 00:16:45,805
Wang, these guys, these Sing Dings.
They got enemies?

149
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:50,405
- Wing Kong.
- Who wear red turbans?
Holy shit!

150
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:52,905
These guys are animals, Jack.

151
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:29,505
- What's happening, Wang?
- Chinese standoff.
A what?

152
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:31,905
Don't make a sound.

153
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:42,305
Who's that?

154
00:21:52,105 --> 00:21:54,905
No questions! Just get outta here, Jack!

155
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:14,405
Jack!

156
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,805
- I think it was Lo Pan.
- Who?

157
00:22:39,305 --> 00:22:41,505
- Don't look, Jack!
- I already did.

158
00:22:41,705 --> 00:22:43,605
- Who? I mean, what?
- Lo Pan. Come on!

159
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:47,605
- I can't see!
- It's OK. It's only temporary. Over here.

160
00:22:49,205 --> 00:22:51,205
Bend over.

161
00:22:52,305 --> 00:22:54,605
Yeah, yeah.

162
00:22:54,905 --> 00:22:58,405
I ran straight through him, Wang.
How the hell did I do that?

163
00:22:58,605 --> 00:23:01,005
- You didn't. It only appeared that way.
- Right!

164
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:06,005
- Lords of Death, Jack.
- OK, I'm goin' home. Keep your money.

165
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:08,405
- Hey, Wang Chi!
- Lookin' for us?

166
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:11,905
- They know your name.
- That's not good. Let's go!

167
00:23:14,905 --> 00:23:16,905
- My truck!
- Forget it!

168
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:42,305
Lords of Death controlled by the Wing Kong,
Jack. Just errand boys for the Wing Kong.

169
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:46,905
Great! Who wiped out all those
yellow turbans? Those guys were winning.

170
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:57,505
He says it was the Storms. The Three Storms.
Three guys did all that? Listen.

171
00:23:57,805 --> 00:24:01,505
What about that...
whatever it was I ran straight through?

172
00:24:01,805 --> 00:24:03,005
Fast!

173
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:17,105
Lucky us. We made it.

174
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:21,005
- All right, where's my truck? I'm outta here.
- Isn't your truck insured?

175
00:24:21,305 --> 00:24:23,705
- Of course it is.
- Then smart man gets it later.

176
00:24:23,905 --> 00:24:28,305
- Smart man calls the cops.
- Cops got better things to do than get killed.
So do I!

177
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:35,605
Mutual Fidelity Insurers of Sacramento.

178
00:24:35,905 --> 00:24:39,905
Well, there's gotta be a listing, honey.
I pay 'em six G's a year in premiums.

179
00:24:40,205 --> 00:24:46,005
China is here, Mr Burton.
The Chang Sing, the Wing Kong.

180
00:24:46,905 --> 00:24:50,705
- They've been fighting for centuries.
- What does that mean? "China is here"?

181
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:55,805
I don't know what that means. All I know is,
this Lo Pan character comes out of thin air

182
00:24:56,105 --> 00:25:01,305
in the middle of an alley, while his buddies
fly around, cuttin' everybody to shreds,

183
00:25:01,705 --> 00:25:05,605
and he stands there, waiting for me
to drive my truck straight through him,

184
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:09,205
- with light comin' out of his mouth!
- Jack, please.

185
00:25:11,905 --> 00:25:14,305
- When did this happen?
- It didn't, not like he says.

186
00:25:14,505 --> 00:25:20,105
Yeah, it did. Two hours ago. Tall guy, weird
clothes. First you see him, then you don't.

187
00:25:20,405 --> 00:25:22,905
Lo Pan appeared on the street?

188
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:27,105
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want to alarm you, Uncle.

189
00:25:27,305 --> 00:25:31,505
I'm gonna tell you about an accident
and I don't wanna hear "act of God", OK?

190
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:35,257
All right, look. What's your name?
Mine's Jack Burton.

191
00:25:35,405 --> 00:25:38,705
- Good afternoon, Mr Wong.
- Eddie Lee, meet my friend, Jack Burton.

192
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:42,305
- Eddie's the new maître d' here.
- And a whole lot more.

193
00:25:42,505 --> 00:25:45,905
Well, I don't know my policy number.
It's in the glove compartment.

194
00:25:46,205 --> 00:25:48,905
Just look under B-U-R-T-O-N, will ya?

195
00:25:49,105 --> 00:25:51,605
- Jack Burton?
- Yeah.

196
00:25:52,105 --> 00:25:55,305
Boy. The guy you always told me about.

197
00:25:56,505 --> 00:26:02,205
- Then that was your abandoned truck.
- Abandoned, like hell!
Hello. Hello?

198
00:26:02,505 --> 00:26:04,005
Oh, Christ!

199
00:26:04,205 --> 00:26:07,205
Bad news. The Lords of Death
stole it after you ran away.

200
00:26:07,405 --> 00:26:10,905
- They stole my truck?
- Take it easy, Jack. You're with friends.

201
00:26:11,205 --> 00:26:13,505
- We'll find it for you.
- Damn right you will.

202
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:18,305
And my money. And time is money to a guy
like me. And your phone is dead, by the way.

203
00:26:18,605 --> 00:26:23,905
- How do you think I feel? I lost a whole girl!
- The Lords of Death were only on ajoyride.

204
00:26:24,205 --> 00:26:26,205
Not acting on orders from the Wing Kong.

205
00:26:26,405 --> 00:26:29,905
They just wanted a girl to sell
and Miao Yin got in the way.

206
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:32,605
Plus, the skirmish you guys stumbled into.

207
00:26:32,805 --> 00:26:37,105
Lo Pan, the word is, ordered the boss of
the Chang Sings, Mr Lem Lee, assassinated.

208
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:39,605
- That was his funeral.
- It was a war, Eddie.

209
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:44,105
- What are you doing here?
- Don't panic. It's only me, Gracie Law.

210
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:45,457
Great.

211
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:48,705
Just passing the neighbourhood
on a dark and stormy night?

212
00:26:49,005 --> 00:26:51,905
- This is my neighbourhood.
- Sure it was a war.

213
00:26:52,105 --> 00:26:56,305
And anybody that showed up was gonnajoin
Lem Lee in the hell of being cut to pieces.

214
00:26:56,605 --> 00:26:59,105
- Hell of being what?
- The Chinese have a lotta hells.

215
00:26:59,305 --> 00:27:03,505
- And what the hell is Gracie Law doing here?
- She can't get enough of me.

216
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:06,305
He wishes. Look, you know me.

217
00:27:06,505 --> 00:27:09,805
I'm always pokin' my nose where it
doesn't belong and, I admit it,

218
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:12,205
this mix-up is my fault, sort of.

219
00:27:12,405 --> 00:27:16,105
But I have it on good advice that the punks
thatjumped me and took his truck,

220
00:27:16,405 --> 00:27:20,305
they took the girl they kidnapped to the
White Tiger's for a quick sale. Who was she?

221
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:24,805
- My fiancée. The White Tiger's?
- Oh, God. I'm sorry.

222
00:27:25,105 --> 00:27:28,605
If we go tonight, we can buy her back.
A warrant's too complicated,

223
00:27:28,905 --> 00:27:31,505
- violence out of the question...
- Hold it! Slow down.

224
00:27:31,705 --> 00:27:34,105
- I'm feelin' like an outsider here.
- You are!

225
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:37,605
Jack, listen. I need more of your help.
I can't pay you today, OK?

226
00:27:37,905 --> 00:27:40,205
- Shit.
- How can I? I need the cash for Miao Yin.

227
00:27:40,405 --> 00:27:45,105
- And it's gonna cost. She's got green eyes.
- Seriously? That's an extra.

228
00:27:45,405 --> 00:27:47,905
It's like leather bucket seats: 
double the price.

229
00:27:48,105 --> 00:27:52,705
- Look, this Lo Pan I ran over... through...
- Has spirit-medium powers.

230
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:57,705
Like the immortals.
His flesh and his bones are atomised.

231
00:27:58,005 --> 00:28:00,605
He becomes the dream.

232
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:04,905
- What?
- That's an exaggeration, Jack, I promise.
Please, help me.

233
00:28:05,405 --> 00:28:07,405
I got a great idea.

234
00:28:20,405 --> 00:28:22,357
- Relax.
- I am relaxed.

235
00:28:22,505 --> 00:28:25,905
Look, this is as far as I go,
because I'm a dead giveaway, see?

236
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:29,905
I'd go in there with you, but they know
my face and they'd wanna push it in.

237
00:28:30,205 --> 00:28:32,705
- Not while I'm around.
- It's all up to you now, Jack.

238
00:28:32,905 --> 00:28:37,605
My destiny rests in your capable hands.
- I'll do my best.
- Make them drop their guard.

239
00:28:37,905 --> 00:28:41,205
- I'll try.
- Look stupid.
He does.

240
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,505
Boy, it sure is rainin' cats and dogs.

241
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:52,605
The cab driver said... He told me that I could...
Well, that the White Tiger would...

242
00:28:54,005 --> 00:28:55,905
Just a minute, please.

243
00:29:02,005 --> 00:29:06,305
Excuse me for a second, guys.
I think I know that car.

244
00:29:11,105 --> 00:29:13,405
What's she doing now?

245
00:29:13,605 --> 00:29:15,505
Strange girl.

246
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:23,105
That building there. The White Tiger.

247
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:27,005
God, it's creepy. Do we have to go in?
Because I will, if we have to.

248
00:29:27,205 --> 00:29:30,405
I'll go anywhere or do anything
to get my story. It's my big break.

249
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:35,505
Just sit tight. We've got one of our best men
inside right now, stirring the pot.

250
00:29:50,405 --> 00:29:55,505
How do you do, ma'am? Henry Swanson's
my name and excitement's my game.

251
00:29:55,805 --> 00:29:59,005
- Cash or charge?
- Gosh! Cash, I guess.

252
00:29:59,305 --> 00:30:01,805
I mean, it's not deductible, is it?

253
00:30:03,705 --> 00:30:06,505
Mrs O'Toole will take care of your needs.

254
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,805
Boy, I wish these were in colour.

255
00:30:09,005 --> 00:30:12,605
Because what I really am
in the mood for is a girl with green eyes.

256
00:30:12,805 --> 00:30:15,357
And price is no object, Mrs O'Toole.

257
00:30:15,505 --> 00:30:19,405
Fresh off the boat's the way I like 'em.
The more exotic the better.

258
00:30:19,705 --> 00:30:22,605
Chinese girls do not come with green eyes.

259
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:45,705
- Too long. Let's go in.
- It's only been ten minutes.
Give the guy a chance.

260
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:51,005
- So how long you been in the US of A?
- Three months.

261
00:30:51,205 --> 00:30:54,005
- Where from?
- Hong Kong.

262
00:30:54,205 --> 00:30:59,105
What happens? You stay here a while?
Old girls leave, new girls come in?

263
00:30:59,505 --> 00:31:02,905
Maybe. Take your tie off, please.

264
00:31:03,205 --> 00:31:07,205
Yeah, I know what you mean.
My wife gave it to me for Christmas.

265
00:31:10,605 --> 00:31:11,905
Holy shit!

266
00:32:44,105 --> 00:32:49,305
Green explosions? People flyin' in and out?
That was not real. I wanna talk to the cops.

267
00:32:49,505 --> 00:32:52,305
I want my truck back.
Now where the hell am I?

268
00:32:52,605 --> 00:32:55,857
- My office. Sit down.
- You sleep in your office?

269
00:32:56,005 --> 00:33:00,605
What I need to get straight is...
These Storms, what are they? Magicians?

270
00:33:00,905 --> 00:33:04,605
- Yeah, sort of. It's hard to explain.
- Try real hard.

271
00:33:04,905 --> 00:33:07,705
If the Storms have Miao Yin,
there's one place they'd go.

272
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:11,805
Lo Pan. The godfather of Little China,
Mr David Lo Pan.

273
00:33:12,105 --> 00:33:15,205
You mean the Lo Pan that's
chairman of the National Orient Bank

274
00:33:15,405 --> 00:33:17,505
and owns the Wing Kong Trading Company,

275
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:21,105
but who's so reclusive
that no one has laid eyes on him in years?

276
00:33:21,305 --> 00:33:23,605
Who the hell are you, anyway?

277
00:33:23,805 --> 00:33:27,205
<i>I'm Margo Litzenberger.
I'm with the Berkeley People's Herald.</i>

278
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:31,705
I've been trying to get somebody from
the press to listen to me about this, Burton.

279
00:33:32,005 --> 00:33:36,705
It's not possible that you saw David Lo Pan.
The bastard's afraid to show his face.

280
00:33:37,005 --> 00:33:39,805
- He's got more enemies...
- He's got Miao Yin. I'm going!

281
00:33:40,005 --> 00:33:42,205
- Are you nuts?
- Who's that?

282
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:45,205
It's OK, Tara. You can go back to sleep.

283
00:33:45,405 --> 00:33:47,605
- From the airport.
- This morning, sure.

284
00:33:47,805 --> 00:33:52,205
That's why I was there. I was protecting her
civil rights, making sure she gets a chance.

285
00:33:52,505 --> 00:33:56,205
This is just so shocking. I mean,
I mustjust be so monumentally naive.

286
00:33:56,505 --> 00:34:01,805
- You are.
- Now we have to grab your fiancée...
Wait a minute! I'm a reasonable guy,

287
00:34:02,105 --> 00:34:04,505
but I've experienced
some unreasonable things.

288
00:34:04,705 --> 00:34:08,405
- It depends on how you look at it.
- The hell it does! So somebody

289
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:10,905
- tell me what is goin' on!
- The truth?

290
00:34:11,105 --> 00:34:13,505
- I can take it.
- We don't know.

291
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:20,105
- I'm going now, alone if I have to!
- Where? It's pouring out.

292
00:34:20,405 --> 00:34:23,905
- Lo Pan's. The Wing Kong Exchange.
- The Wing Kong Exchange?

293
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:27,705
The most dangerous den of madmen
in Chinatown? You can't waltz in like...

294
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:32,405
Like the wind. Yes, I can, Miss Law.
My mind and my spirits are as one.

295
00:34:32,705 --> 00:34:35,505
- As two. I said I was comin'.
- I'd go with you...

296
00:34:35,705 --> 00:34:38,505
I know. There's a problem with your face.

297
00:34:38,705 --> 00:34:42,605
OK! You people sit tight,
hold the fort and keep the home fires burning.

298
00:34:42,905 --> 00:34:46,305
If we're not back by dawn, call the president.

299
00:34:56,205 --> 00:35:01,505
- This is gonna take crackerjack timing.
- Total concentration. You ready, Jack?

300
00:35:01,905 --> 00:35:03,905
I was born ready.

301
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:10,105
I love working nights.

302
00:35:10,305 --> 00:35:12,205
Don't get up. Phone company.

303
00:35:12,405 --> 00:35:16,305
All right, boys, where's the main panel?
Probably through here.

304
00:35:24,805 --> 00:35:26,705
Wang.

305
00:35:35,505 --> 00:35:38,905
Good work, Jack.
I think they actually fell for it.

306
00:35:41,505 --> 00:35:45,705
Well, last time we had this problem was
on account of squirrels chewin' the wires.

307
00:35:46,005 --> 00:35:50,405
- I'd better locate the central junction box.
- I think it's down there.

308
00:35:55,205 --> 00:35:59,505
What does that say?
- Hell of boiling oil.
- You're kidding!

309
00:35:59,705 --> 00:36:02,005
Yeah, I am. It says "Keep out."

310
00:36:06,505 --> 00:36:08,805
We've got to do something!

311
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:18,505
Goat butts against a hedge
and its horns become entangled.

312
00:36:19,705 --> 00:36:23,805
- I don't think I've had the pleasure.
- Miss Gracie Law, Mr Egg Shen.

313
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:26,505
Egg's kind of our local authority on Lo Pan.

314
00:36:26,705 --> 00:36:29,105
- He's helping us out.
- It has been almost two hours.

315
00:36:29,405 --> 00:36:32,605
- Let's go over there, beat down the door...
- No, Miss Law.

316
00:36:32,805 --> 00:36:37,805
We have to gather our strength,
because now there's clouds and thunder.

317
00:36:38,105 --> 00:36:41,305
The image of difficulty at the beginning.

318
00:36:41,605 --> 00:36:45,305
But finally we shall bring order out of chaos.

319
00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:52,905
- Look.
- Yeah.

320
00:36:53,105 --> 00:36:58,005
What you got here is two
people dragging a third.
Miao Yin!

321
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:16,205
- You did that, right?
- I guess so. I hope so.

322
00:37:22,005 --> 00:37:24,205
Jack, check this out.

323
00:37:25,605 --> 00:37:30,305
So what is this? Chinese or somethin'?
- Countin' backwards?
- Not backwards. Downwards.

324
00:37:40,905 --> 00:37:45,705
Of course the Chinese mix everything up.
Look at what they have to work with.

325
00:37:46,005 --> 00:37:50,705
There's Buddhism, Confucianism
and Taoist alchemy and sorcery.

326
00:37:51,205 --> 00:37:55,305
We take what we want and leave the rest.
Just like your salad bar.

327
00:37:55,505 --> 00:37:59,305
But there is one thing
even David Lo Pan must acknowledge.

328
00:37:59,605 --> 00:38:05,905
All movement in the universe is caused by
tension between positive and negative furies.

329
00:38:06,205 --> 00:38:10,405
- So when the furies are out of balance...
- As they are in Lo Pan, who is cursed.

330
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,705
Then the people
turn into demons and live for ever.

331
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:18,005
Repulsive and evil,
existing only to plague the living.

332
00:38:18,305 --> 00:38:23,405
Well then, what you're saying is
this David Lo Pan... What is he? A ghost?

333
00:38:23,705 --> 00:38:29,405
Plays at being a man.
A creature of vast, dark, destructive power.

334
00:38:30,205 --> 00:38:35,105
All right, out this hatch and up the cable.
Does that sound like a brilliant idea or what?

335
00:38:35,405 --> 00:38:38,205
The cable is three storeys high
and covered with grease.

336
00:38:38,405 --> 00:38:42,105
Exactly. It's real and we can touch it,
so at least we know where we stand.

337
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:44,105
Yeah, in deep shit.

338
00:38:46,905 --> 00:38:49,405
- What?
- What the hell...?

339
00:38:51,405 --> 00:38:52,792
- Shit!
- See?

340
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,705
You think they'd let us
walk in and out like the wind?

341
00:38:56,005 --> 00:39:01,005
Yes.
I thought that was your whole damn point!
My point was to find Miao Yin at any cost!

342
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:04,005
- This is salt water, Wang.
- And get your truck back!

343
00:39:04,205 --> 00:39:07,805
- I'll buy another one.
- But there's only one Miao Yin!

344
00:39:35,905 --> 00:39:40,305
Jesus Christ! Where are we?
Hell of the upside-down sinners!

345
00:39:55,005 --> 00:39:59,005
Hey, you! Come on over here
and fight like a man!

346
00:40:38,405 --> 00:40:41,805
Shit, Jack. I don't like the looks of this.

347
00:40:44,505 --> 00:40:47,305
- Where are we, Wang?
- You are nowhere!

348
00:41:13,205 --> 00:41:15,005
Oh, boy.

349
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:18,505
Look, we came here to see David Lo Pan,
all right?

350
00:41:18,905 --> 00:41:20,405
David Lo Pan?

351
00:41:20,605 --> 00:41:24,105
- Then you have succeeded, Mr Burton.
- What, you?

352
00:41:25,205 --> 00:41:28,205
- I don't get this at all. I thought...
- Shut up, Mr Burton!

353
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:32,305
- You are not put upon this world to "get it".
- Come on! Lo Pan is like...

354
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:34,405
Nothing you can understand.

355
00:41:34,605 --> 00:41:39,705
There are many mysteries and unanswerable
questions, even in a life as short as yours.

356
00:41:39,905 --> 00:41:43,405
The way I see it, it doesn't mean
we shouldn't ask. Where's my truck?

357
00:41:43,605 --> 00:41:47,805
You are not looking for a truck. You're
looking for a girl. A girl with green eyes.

358
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:51,205
- Yes.
- She must be something extraordinary.

359
00:41:51,505 --> 00:41:54,005
Or I'm not about to waste another 2,000 years.

360
00:41:54,205 --> 00:41:57,605
There can't be many Chinese girls
with green eyes these days.

361
00:41:57,805 --> 00:42:03,005
- There are not. Never were.
- So beggars can't be choosers.
But I can!

362
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,805
Tell me about Miao Yin.

363
00:42:07,005 --> 00:42:09,405
What province is she from? Hunan?

364
00:42:10,005 --> 00:42:13,905
Her mother? Her father?
He must be a holy man. I must know.

365
00:42:14,205 --> 00:42:17,605
You got a tongue, Dave. Ask her yourself.

366
00:42:23,005 --> 00:42:27,505
Mr Burton, if you have an influence over
your youthful friend, you better exert it now.

367
00:42:27,805 --> 00:42:31,705
Otherwise I will send both of you to
the hell where people are skinned alive.

368
00:42:31,905 --> 00:42:34,205
It's that simple. Understand?

369
00:42:35,405 --> 00:42:39,005
- Are you crazy? Is that your problem?
- No, he means it, Jack.

370
00:42:39,205 --> 00:42:44,105
My problem is this place.
This place is my tomb. I'm buried here.

371
00:42:44,405 --> 00:42:50,205
A young man, a king, a warrior,
is entombed in this old man's crippled body.

372
00:42:52,205 --> 00:42:54,757
And all I need is a woman, Mr Burton,

373
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:58,005
a special kind of woman
with dragon-green eyes,

374
00:42:58,205 --> 00:43:03,405
to make me whole and young again, so that I
may rule the universe from beyond the grave.

375
00:43:03,605 --> 00:43:08,805
- Ch'ing-ti. The God of the East.
- Who, him? This guy?
No, not me, Mr Burton.

376
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:14,805
My demon. The god I must appease
in order to regain my heart, my blood.

377
00:43:15,605 --> 00:43:19,205
A girl with green eyes to satisfy Ch'ing-ti,

378
00:43:19,505 --> 00:43:22,205
a girl brave enough
to embrace the naked blade.

379
00:43:22,405 --> 00:43:26,905
- When I find her, I will marry her.
- Never!
Ch'ing-ti will be happy and my curse lifted.

380
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:29,905
You can rule the universe
from beyond the grave.

381
00:43:30,105 --> 00:43:34,805
- Indeed!
- Or check into a psycho ward.
Whichever comes first.

382
00:43:35,105 --> 00:43:39,805
What, I'm supposed to buy this shit? 2,000
years and he can't find a broad to fit the bill?

383
00:43:40,105 --> 00:43:43,005
Come on, Dave, you must be doin'
somethin' seriously wrong.

384
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:48,705
There have been others, to be sure.
There are always others, are there not?

385
00:43:49,105 --> 00:43:53,105
You seem to be one who knows
the difficulties between men and women,

386
00:43:53,405 --> 00:43:55,605
how seldom it works out.

387
00:43:56,305 --> 00:43:59,505
And yet we all keep trying, like fools.

388
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:07,305
Who are these people? Friends of yours?
Now this really pisses me off to no end!

389
00:44:07,605 --> 00:44:11,005
- Come on, stick around!
- Where's Miao Yin? In this building?

390
00:44:11,305 --> 00:44:12,805
- Safe.
- Where is she?

391
00:44:13,005 --> 00:44:16,405
Safe.
Safer with me than any creature on earth!

392
00:44:18,105 --> 00:44:20,905
Go ahead. You want bad publicity?
Give us the run-around.

393
00:44:21,105 --> 00:44:25,105
But this woman has a deadline,
and her pen is mightier than your sword.

394
00:44:25,405 --> 00:44:28,105
- Yeah.
- No visitors.

395
00:44:28,305 --> 00:44:32,405
- I don't make the policy around here.
- Come on, man! Give 'em a tour.

396
00:44:32,705 --> 00:44:35,005
What's it gonna hurt?

397
00:44:36,205 --> 00:44:38,405
I can help you.

398
00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:09,805
- Are you OK, Jack?
- Yeah.

399
00:45:12,205 --> 00:45:16,005
We're in a room.
No windows, a few skeletons.

400
00:45:16,305 --> 00:45:19,305
- Where's the light coming from?
- The floor.

401
00:45:34,805 --> 00:45:38,305
With the easing of trade restrictions,

402
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:43,305
next year we'll start importing
a lot of strange things from Peking.

403
00:45:43,605 --> 00:45:46,505
What sort of strange things?

404
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:49,005
Are we going up or down?

405
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:51,105
It feels like down.

406
00:46:11,005 --> 00:46:13,405
Great. Thank you, Jack.

407
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:18,305
I think we've come up. First we went down.
Now they've brought us up.

408
00:46:19,705 --> 00:46:24,405
Two, three feet thick, I'll bet. Probably
welded shut and covered with brick by now.

409
00:46:24,705 --> 00:46:28,405
- Don't give up, Jack.
- OK. Let's just chew our way outta here!

410
00:46:28,605 --> 00:46:31,105
Lo Pan has plans for us,
or we'd be dead doornails.

411
00:46:31,305 --> 00:46:36,205
Which Lo Pan? Little old basket case
on wheels, or the ten-foot-tall roadblock?

412
00:46:36,605 --> 00:46:41,405
- One and the same person, Jack.
- You know something you're not tellin' me.

413
00:46:41,705 --> 00:46:44,005
Myths and legends.

414
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:48,005
- I don't wanna insult you.
- No, no. Go ahead.

415
00:46:49,005 --> 00:46:50,505
Insult me.

416
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:55,805
It's about all sorts of scary things:
an ancient army of the dead,

417
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:59,505
the Spirit City and monkey sacrifices.

418
00:46:59,705 --> 00:47:01,805
The First Sovereign Emperor of China,

419
00:47:02,005 --> 00:47:05,805
that mad monarch who federated our
seven warring states, defeated Lo Pan

420
00:47:06,105 --> 00:47:11,105
and imposed upon him
that horrible curse of no flesh in 272 BC.

421
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:16,405
A lot of Chinese hear these things
when we're kids, then we grow up,

422
00:47:17,505 --> 00:47:19,905
and pretend not to believe them.

423
00:47:20,205 --> 00:47:23,105
- No horseshit, Wang.
- No horseshit, Jack.

424
00:47:23,305 --> 00:47:28,405
I don't blame you. I'm Chinese and I don't
even wanna believe it, but it's for real.

425
00:47:28,705 --> 00:47:31,105
Sorcery, the Chinese black magic.

426
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:38,605
Blindfolds!

427
00:47:57,805 --> 00:47:59,805
You make one move...

428
00:48:06,105 --> 00:48:09,905
Now, let's try that again.
Don't make me kill you, tough guy.

429
00:48:11,905 --> 00:48:13,705
Come on, Jack!

430
00:48:14,305 --> 00:48:16,305
- Come on!
- How?

431
00:49:10,905 --> 00:49:12,805
- Great work, Jack.
- Yeah.

432
00:49:13,005 --> 00:49:18,005
We're all in: me, Gracie and Margo. Uncle Chu
and Egg are in Egg's bus, ready to get us out.

433
00:49:18,305 --> 00:49:21,805
- Right.
- Here, Jack.
I'll trade ya.

434
00:49:23,205 --> 00:49:28,205
All right, which way?
Fast, before they wake up.
There, I think. Down there.

435
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,805
No pathetic excuses.

436
00:49:37,805 --> 00:49:43,805
I smell the blood of human beings.
Find them. Boil them until their flesh falls off.

437
00:49:44,505 --> 00:49:46,505
You heard me!

438
00:50:42,605 --> 00:50:44,605
Empty.

439
00:50:47,105 --> 00:50:49,605
I need you, Miao Yin.

440
00:50:50,205 --> 00:50:54,605
You, whose eyes flash like emerald lightning.

441
00:50:55,805 --> 00:50:59,605
Ch'ing-ti, make me flesh again soon.

442
00:51:01,805 --> 00:51:03,305
Please.

443
00:51:05,205 --> 00:51:07,005
Let's go. It's clear.

444
00:51:12,905 --> 00:51:14,805
Safety!

445
00:51:18,805 --> 00:51:20,305
Wang!

446
00:51:26,305 --> 00:51:28,905
First time you ever plugged somebody?

447
00:51:29,705 --> 00:51:31,705
- Course not.
- Come on!

448
00:51:33,405 --> 00:51:37,205
You wanna go up or down?
- Up or down?
- Up.

449
00:52:00,105 --> 00:52:03,905
All has become strange.

450
00:52:05,105 --> 00:52:10,705
A world so unreal and yet,
at once, so frightening.

451
00:52:34,505 --> 00:52:37,305
Open up or I'll blow his head off!

452
00:52:40,705 --> 00:52:43,505
Open! Or he dies in the name of Ch'ing-ti

453
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:47,505
and your souls speed with his
to the hell of the oily dragon!

454
00:53:14,805 --> 00:53:16,805
- You all right?
- Yeah.

455
00:53:21,705 --> 00:53:23,505
- Margo!
- Jack!

456
00:53:23,705 --> 00:53:27,305
- Where's Gracie?
- On the floor next door. She's a wildcat.

457
00:53:27,505 --> 00:53:31,005
- How are you gonna spring us?
- I have no idea.

458
00:54:08,705 --> 00:54:11,105
That way maybe.

459
00:54:14,705 --> 00:54:16,705
Wang, haul ass!

460
00:54:31,605 --> 00:54:33,505
Come on, keep movin'!

461
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,705
Margo, jump in!

462
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:40,705
- In there? Are you nuts?
- Go!

463
00:55:12,105 --> 00:55:14,505
- Where's Margo?
- I don't know.

464
00:55:17,905 --> 00:55:21,105
Where are we?
- Where's Eddie?
- Beats me.

465
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:26,405
Where's Jack?

466
00:55:28,405 --> 00:55:30,305
Jack!

467
00:55:32,305 --> 00:55:34,305
Jack?

468
00:55:36,505 --> 00:55:38,405
Jack!

469
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:46,905
- Sorry, I'm just thrilled to be alive.
- Yeah, sure. Let's go.

470
00:55:54,005 --> 00:55:57,405
- It's like some giant garbage disposal.
- I think it is, sort of.

471
00:55:57,705 --> 00:56:01,505
Will you just stop rubbing
your body up against mine?

472
00:56:01,705 --> 00:56:07,705
I can't concentrate when you do that.
What a pig you are, Burton! I mean, really!

473
00:56:10,505 --> 00:56:14,405
- Where's Jack?
- It's OK. Everybody relax. I'm here.

474
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,905
Jack, I know where we are.
This is a central... what do you call it?

475
00:56:18,105 --> 00:56:20,705
- Sewer?
- Yeah. Water comes in up there.

476
00:56:20,905 --> 00:56:25,505
Seawater from the bay fills this room. They
divert it through pipes to different chambers.

477
00:56:25,805 --> 00:56:29,205
I bet up there's where
we first got on that elevator.

478
00:56:57,105 --> 00:57:00,405
All right, we're almost outta here.
From here on, it gets normal.

479
00:57:00,705 --> 00:57:06,305
Offices, storerooms: a nice false front.
I count to three, open the door, and we go.

480
00:57:06,605 --> 00:57:10,905
- Everybody got that?
- Ready?
Follow the leader. One, two, three.

481
00:57:15,105 --> 00:57:16,805
We may be trapped.

482
00:57:19,905 --> 00:57:22,105
Hide!

483
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:25,905
- Hide?
- Hide! They only saw me!

484
00:57:30,005 --> 00:57:32,505
We fight together, Jack. Do or die.

485
00:58:23,405 --> 00:58:24,805
Time to go.

486
00:58:29,705 --> 00:58:32,705
The bus is right outside in the parking lot.

487
00:58:54,005 --> 00:58:58,705
Here's the deal. I run interference and
you bring up the rear. Can you handle that?

488
00:58:59,005 --> 00:59:00,205
Can you?

489
00:59:00,605 --> 00:59:03,905
Well, what a night's work!
You got a problem like that again,

490
00:59:04,105 --> 00:59:06,805
- you reach for the sky!
- Let's go!

491
00:59:09,205 --> 00:59:11,105
Come on, come on.

492
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:15,705
- You're doin' real good, guys.
- Come on, Jack!

493
00:59:17,605 --> 00:59:20,105
Let's go! Open the doors!

494
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:25,705
- Hurry!
- Move it, Egg!

495
00:59:27,405 --> 00:59:29,305
Duck!

496
00:59:45,405 --> 00:59:48,405
We made it. Holy shit, we made it!

497
00:59:49,205 --> 00:59:52,005
- Where's Miao Yin?
- Inside.

498
00:59:52,605 --> 00:59:54,305
Somewhere inside.

499
00:59:57,405 --> 00:59:58,905
Where's Gracie?

500
01:00:15,405 --> 01:00:18,405
Put me down, you overstuffed monster!

501
01:00:22,705 --> 01:00:25,405
Let me go! Let me go!

502
01:01:03,705 --> 01:01:05,705
What does it mean?

503
01:01:05,905 --> 01:01:08,505
Two girls with green eyes?

504
01:01:08,705 --> 01:01:10,705
After all these years.

505
01:01:10,905 --> 01:01:16,205
You bastards! Unchain me! You're not
gonna get away with this. Where's Lo Pan?

506
01:01:18,405 --> 01:01:20,505
This one has fire as well!

507
01:01:20,705 --> 01:01:24,505
Listen,
I've had it up to here with you maniacs.

508
01:01:24,805 --> 01:01:28,805
I wanna see that disgusting
flesh-peddler David Lo Pan in person.

509
01:01:29,005 --> 01:01:33,805
Unless the coward's afraid to see
an unarmed girl one-on-one!

510
01:01:34,605 --> 01:01:36,505
Where is he?

511
01:01:45,805 --> 01:01:50,505
<i>You know what this is?
This is like some radical Alice In Wonderland.</i>

512
01:01:50,905 --> 01:01:54,905
- That's what this is.
- Then you've got a best seller on your hands.

513
01:01:55,105 --> 01:02:00,805
- Call the police. You're not a one-man army.
- Cops got better things to do than get killed.

514
01:02:04,505 --> 01:02:06,105
Here he is, Jack.

515
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:09,805
No, these are our friends.
These are the Chang Sings.

516
01:02:10,005 --> 01:02:15,005
- Any of 'em savvy English?
- Hey, man. Who is this guy?
All right. You got any guns?

517
01:02:15,405 --> 01:02:20,605
Not against Lo Pan, but here's one for you
to make you feel better, like Dirty Harry.

518
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:23,957
I'll stick with these. You comin' with us, Egg?

519
01:02:24,105 --> 01:02:28,805
Of course, Jack. It's my destiny. Besides,
if I don't you'll never make it out alive.

520
01:02:29,105 --> 01:02:31,505
- I'm on board too then.
- Yeah, sure, kid.

521
01:02:31,705 --> 01:02:35,305
- You can't keep the press out. It's America.
- You're not going back there.

522
01:02:35,605 --> 01:02:38,105
You're stayin' here with Eddie and Uncle Chu.

523
01:02:38,305 --> 01:02:41,405
- Eddie? But he's...
- He's got a crush on you.

524
01:02:41,705 --> 01:02:45,805
- You mean like you've got on Gracie?
- Are you kidding? I just want my truck back.

525
01:02:46,105 --> 01:02:51,405
What do I know?
She's not even your type. All brains.
Come on, let's go!

526
01:03:00,305 --> 01:03:03,905
Play your cards right, you live to talk about it.

527
01:03:27,005 --> 01:03:29,005
Oh, boy.

528
01:03:30,305 --> 01:03:33,205
Are you OK? Are you Miao Yin?

529
01:03:33,505 --> 01:03:36,605
Yes. Miao Yin.

530
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:39,705
- Who are you?
- Lo Pan.

531
01:03:39,905 --> 01:03:43,305
You have come to seek me out
with your green eyes.

532
01:03:43,605 --> 01:03:45,505
Yes.

533
01:03:45,705 --> 01:03:47,605
- No, no.
- Yes.

534
01:03:49,505 --> 01:03:54,905
- What's going on here? Some kind of...?
- Magic. The darkest magic.

535
01:03:55,305 --> 01:04:01,305
My soul swims in it, scattered across time,
trapped in the world of formlessness.

536
01:04:01,905 --> 01:04:05,705
Until I find her and marry her.

537
01:04:06,005 --> 01:04:07,305
Marry her?

538
01:04:07,505 --> 01:04:12,505
The girl with green eyes.
The girl who can tame the burning blade.

539
01:04:14,805 --> 01:04:19,105
Miao Yin or Grace Law.

540
01:04:29,705 --> 01:04:33,705
- Great start. It's the other way.
- The front door will get you nowhere.

541
01:04:33,905 --> 01:04:37,405
- Here, let me hold that.
- A brave man likes to feel nature on his face.

542
01:04:37,705 --> 01:04:41,405
And a wise man has enough sense
to get in out of the rain.

543
01:04:53,005 --> 01:04:55,605
- He lives here?
- He owns the block. He's a rich guy.

544
01:04:55,805 --> 01:04:59,005
- Rich? This place is a dump, Wang.
- To Western eyes.

545
01:04:59,305 --> 01:05:02,105
The stuff in these bottles is priceless.

546
01:05:03,605 --> 01:05:06,405
Well, all set?

547
01:05:07,505 --> 01:05:10,005
Yeah. Ready when you are, Egg.

548
01:05:29,405 --> 01:05:31,205
- Jack next.
- Where does it go?

549
01:05:31,405 --> 01:05:34,257
- Down. Lo Pan is down there.
- Down where?

550
01:05:34,405 --> 01:05:39,305
- Where is the universe?
- Come on, Jack. Don't be afraid.
Afraid? Are you kidding?

551
01:05:53,805 --> 01:05:57,905
- Where in the hell are we?
- Underneath Chinatown.

552
01:06:58,705 --> 01:07:00,905
That is not water.

553
01:07:01,105 --> 01:07:03,505
Black blood of the earth.

554
01:07:03,705 --> 01:07:07,805
- Do you mean oil?
- I mean black blood of the earth.

555
01:07:08,105 --> 01:07:13,005
A thousand years ago, huge earthquakes
turned the world upside down.

556
01:07:15,505 --> 01:07:17,905
Many normal people were killed.

557
01:07:20,305 --> 01:07:24,205
Many unnatural people roam free

558
01:07:24,405 --> 01:07:28,805
to commit great offences against the gods.

559
01:09:15,405 --> 01:09:20,205
They have survived the burning blade,
tamed the savage heart.

560
01:09:23,205 --> 01:09:25,405
I will marry both women.

561
01:09:27,505 --> 01:09:29,905
Prepare them.

562
01:09:44,705 --> 01:09:46,605
What is that?

563
01:09:48,405 --> 01:09:52,205
- It sounds like...
- Something breathing underwater?

564
01:09:52,505 --> 01:09:54,105
Yeah.

565
01:10:04,005 --> 01:10:06,057
You will come out no more!

566
01:10:06,205 --> 01:10:09,705
What? What'll come out no more?

567
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:12,005
Come on.

568
01:10:12,205 --> 01:10:14,205
Dammit!

569
01:10:27,105 --> 01:10:29,105
Miao Yin?

570
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:09,805
Hey, Wang!

571
01:11:10,005 --> 01:11:12,505
- Egg!
- Jack, come on!

572
01:11:27,405 --> 01:11:33,605
It's OK, Jack. Wing Kong storeroom.
Emergency provisions.
We're inside Lo Pan's domain.

573
01:11:34,005 --> 01:11:35,805
Christ!

574
01:11:38,705 --> 01:11:39,757
Later.

575
01:11:39,905 --> 01:11:44,305
We're getting close. Real close.
And now for some more bad news. Ready?

576
01:11:44,605 --> 01:11:48,905
- This gets worse? Come on!
- 2,258 years ago

577
01:11:49,205 --> 01:11:51,605
the First Sovereign Emperor...

578
01:11:53,205 --> 01:11:56,705
He subjugated Lo Pan, made him of no flesh.

579
01:11:57,805 --> 01:12:01,405
- Only an evil dream.
- Get to the goddamn point, Egg.

580
01:12:01,705 --> 01:12:06,705
In order to be whole again, he had to find
this certain girl of his prophecy,

581
01:12:07,005 --> 01:12:09,605
and marry her to appease the God of the East.

582
01:12:09,805 --> 01:12:14,605
But to appease the emperor,
he had to kill her.
Kill her? No!

583
01:12:14,905 --> 01:12:18,805
Well, let's go. What are we talkin'
Chinese history for when we gotta get...

584
01:12:19,105 --> 01:12:22,505
We are getting ready to strike the final blow.

585
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:26,305
- If we reach Lo Pan...
- When we reach Lo Pan.

586
01:12:26,505 --> 01:12:29,105
...then the power in this flask
will be our only hope

587
01:12:29,305 --> 01:12:34,005
against the Bodhisattva of the underworld,
the ultimate evil spirit.

588
01:12:35,405 --> 01:12:39,205
Yes. Only a dream can kill a dream.

589
01:12:39,805 --> 01:12:42,705
I've waited for this for a long time, Jack.

590
01:12:43,805 --> 01:12:46,305
The evil dream will die.

591
01:12:52,905 --> 01:12:54,605
Wing Kong outside.

592
01:13:20,805 --> 01:13:24,305
- Were they real?
- Yeah. Dressed for Lo Pan's wedding.

593
01:13:24,505 --> 01:13:28,905
What's in the flask? Magic potion?
- Yeah.
- Thought so. Good. Do we drink it?

594
01:13:29,205 --> 01:13:31,305
- Yeah.
- Good. Thought so.

595
01:14:07,405 --> 01:14:11,705
I am the past,
come back to haunt you, Lo Pan!

596
01:14:14,105 --> 01:14:18,205
My God, no! Please!
What is that? Don't tell me.

597
01:14:18,505 --> 01:14:22,705
A guardian. What it sees, Lo Pan knows.

598
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:25,305
They have returned.

599
01:14:25,505 --> 01:14:29,505
And this time they are not alone.
Egg Shen is with them.

600
01:14:29,805 --> 01:14:35,205
Little bastard sorcerer has brought them
through the Bog of the Dead Trees.

601
01:14:35,505 --> 01:14:37,105
Egg Shen?

602
01:14:37,305 --> 01:14:42,105
Egg Shen! You have come
a long ways to find me, but it is too late.

603
01:14:42,405 --> 01:14:46,505
There are two girls with green eyes,
and I will marry them both.

604
01:14:46,805 --> 01:14:50,005
And then I will sacrifice Gracie Law
to appease my emperor,

605
01:14:50,205 --> 01:14:54,305
and live out my earthly pleasures
with Miao Yin.

606
01:14:57,105 --> 01:15:00,205
That's right, Egg Shen.
The best of two worlds.

607
01:15:07,205 --> 01:15:09,705
You never know till you try.

608
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,905
Let's get outta here.

609
01:15:22,405 --> 01:15:27,405
You know what I don't like?
Where is everybody?
Preparing for Lo Pan's wedding.

610
01:15:38,305 --> 01:15:41,905
We should not be in here, not this easily.
It's a setup, I'm tellin' ya.

611
01:15:42,105 --> 01:15:48,105
Lo Pan is about to take his queen.
He's too busy to care.
So where is he, Egg? Where?

612
01:16:20,005 --> 01:16:22,005
- Jack, here!
- What?

613
01:16:25,705 --> 01:16:27,605
- Hollow.
- Fuck it.

614
01:16:32,405 --> 01:16:35,905
- I know. It's an elevator. It only goes down.
- Yeah, look.

615
01:16:36,205 --> 01:16:40,005
- Hey, all right!
- Time for the medicine!

616
01:16:47,805 --> 01:16:51,305
- Cheers!
- This does what again, exactly?

617
01:16:51,605 --> 01:16:54,105
Huge buzz.

618
01:16:55,105 --> 01:16:56,905
Good!

619
01:16:57,105 --> 01:17:01,305
You can see things no one else can see,
do things no one else can do.

620
01:17:01,505 --> 01:17:03,705
- Real things?
- As real as Lo Pan.

621
01:17:03,905 --> 01:17:07,805
- What more can a guy ask for?
- The six-demon bag!

622
01:17:08,105 --> 01:17:11,605
Terrific. A six-demon bag.
Sensational. What's in it, Egg?

623
01:17:11,805 --> 01:17:14,505
Wind! Fire! All that kind of thing.

624
01:17:14,705 --> 01:17:17,105
Here's to the army and navy
and the battles they have won.

625
01:17:17,305 --> 01:17:19,905
Here's to America's colours,
the colours that never run.

626
01:17:20,205 --> 01:17:23,305
May the wings of liberty never lose a feather.

627
01:17:37,905 --> 01:17:41,205
I feel pretty good. You know, I'm not...

628
01:17:41,405 --> 01:17:44,405
I'm not scared at all. I just feel kind of...

629
01:17:45,405 --> 01:17:48,057
- I feel kind of invincible.
- Me too.

630
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:52,005
- I got a very positive attitude about this.
- Good. Me too.

631
01:17:58,005 --> 01:18:03,505
Is it gettin' hot in here, or is itjust me?
Ch'ing-ti! Ch'ing-ti!

632
01:18:04,605 --> 01:18:08,205
Great Ch'ing-ti, equal with heaven,

633
01:18:08,405 --> 01:18:14,105
come into our presence
and witness this holy matrimony.

634
01:18:14,505 --> 01:18:18,005
- Miao Yin.
- And the ultimate evil spirit.

635
01:18:23,505 --> 01:18:26,805
And now, my beloved disciples,

636
01:18:27,005 --> 01:18:29,305
the moment of truth.

637
01:18:29,505 --> 01:18:31,905
The needle of love.

638
01:18:35,605 --> 01:18:38,405
- I'd like to shoot that bastard.
- Not until he's married.

639
01:18:38,605 --> 01:18:43,405
- Then he's flesh.
- Then it's too late.
Ch'ing-ti!

640
01:18:43,705 --> 01:18:48,305
You, who shake the heavens
and descend from the east,

641
01:18:48,605 --> 01:18:52,105
all I ask in order to conquer this universe

642
01:18:52,305 --> 01:18:56,505
is that you grant me flesh and blood.

643
01:18:58,505 --> 01:19:01,505
Yes! Guide my hand

644
01:19:02,505 --> 01:19:06,505
as I insert this needle into Miao Yin.

645
01:19:07,505 --> 01:19:11,205
Let him complete the ceremony.
Then he is ours for certain!

646
01:19:11,405 --> 01:19:13,805
Come, my love. Give it to me.

647
01:19:27,205 --> 01:19:29,005
It's working!

648
01:19:30,705 --> 01:19:32,705
I'm mortal!

649
01:19:41,305 --> 01:19:43,205
Look out, guys!

650
01:19:58,905 --> 01:20:00,405
No way!

651
01:21:04,005 --> 01:21:06,305
Come, Miao Yin, it won't hurt.

652
01:22:07,105 --> 01:22:08,505
Shit!

653
01:22:16,905 --> 01:22:18,105
Take her.

654
01:22:41,205 --> 01:22:43,405
Peasant magic!

655
01:23:18,905 --> 01:23:21,405
You never could beat me, Egg Shen.

656
01:24:27,305 --> 01:24:28,557
- It's me.
- Are you all right?

657
01:24:28,705 --> 01:24:33,205
- Never mind me. We gotta get Lo Pan.
- Where is he?
Wang!

658
01:24:33,505 --> 01:24:35,205
Come on.

659
01:24:37,305 --> 01:24:39,305
Pull it apart. Come on!

660
01:25:06,605 --> 01:25:10,805
- Where does this go?
- Up. To Lo Pan's office. It's cooler up there.

661
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:13,905
- From there we can...
- Do you have a gun, I hope?

662
01:25:14,105 --> 01:25:17,405
- I have a knife.
- A knife? He's 12 feet tall!

663
01:25:17,605 --> 01:25:20,705
Seven. Don't worry.
I can handle him. I took something.

664
01:25:21,005 --> 01:25:23,605
I can see things no one else can see.

665
01:25:24,905 --> 01:25:28,305
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I was getting married.

666
01:25:28,605 --> 01:25:33,605
He was marrying both of us,
just because my eyes are green too.

667
01:25:43,105 --> 01:25:45,605
Oh, God. Is this really happening?

668
01:25:52,905 --> 01:25:56,105
- Look into my eyes.
- No! Never!

669
01:25:56,305 --> 01:26:00,005
I have suffered so much pain and agony.
Look at me!

670
01:26:00,305 --> 01:26:03,905
No! I don't understand. I don't belong to you!

671
01:26:04,205 --> 01:26:07,905
No, you don't. You belong to Ch'ing-ti.

672
01:26:08,105 --> 01:26:13,005
I must sacrifice you,
but I love you and I need you.
No!

673
01:26:13,305 --> 01:26:18,205
Here, take her! Take the bitch!
- Master, you are flesh!
- I am?

674
01:26:19,105 --> 01:26:22,005
I am! It worked!

675
01:26:22,205 --> 01:26:24,805
Ch'ing-ti is appeased.

676
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:30,405
Now we must satisfy the First
Sovereign Emperor by destroying this!

677
01:26:30,705 --> 01:26:32,805
Not so fast, gentlemen.

678
01:26:33,005 --> 01:26:36,505
Is it too much to ask, Thunder?
Kill him! For me!

679
01:26:36,805 --> 01:26:41,405
It won't solve anything, Dave. Too many
people have been droppin' like flies already

680
01:26:41,705 --> 01:26:45,205
and where's that gettin' us? Nowhere, fast.

681
01:26:45,405 --> 01:26:48,605
Nah, you know what Jack Burton
always says at a time like this?

682
01:26:48,905 --> 01:26:51,805
- Who?
- Jack Burton. Me!

683
01:27:00,305 --> 01:27:02,405
Old Jack always says

684
01:27:03,005 --> 01:27:05,005
"What the hell?"

685
01:27:30,805 --> 01:27:32,505
It's a good knife.

686
01:27:34,805 --> 01:27:36,505
Goodbye, Mr Burton.

687
01:28:00,805 --> 01:28:03,205
It's all in the reflexes.

688
01:28:06,505 --> 01:28:08,105
Wang!

689
01:28:15,905 --> 01:28:17,957
You all right?

690
01:28:18,105 --> 01:28:20,405
- Hey, thanks.
- Wait a minute.

691
01:28:56,005 --> 01:28:58,305
I don't think he's gonna stop!

692
01:29:02,505 --> 01:29:03,905
Come on!

693
01:29:23,805 --> 01:29:26,105
- We got a problem.
- There!

694
01:29:58,005 --> 01:30:00,305
Come on, Jack!

695
01:30:02,305 --> 01:30:04,305
Jump, Jack!

696
01:30:14,505 --> 01:30:17,605
- This whole place is melting!
- Hello! Hello!

697
01:30:18,305 --> 01:30:22,305
- How'd you get up there?
- It wasn't easy! Stand aside!

698
01:30:27,105 --> 01:30:29,205
Take it away!

699
01:30:48,905 --> 01:30:50,805
Hang onto this.

700
01:30:53,105 --> 01:30:55,005
Watch out, Wang Chi!

701
01:31:04,605 --> 01:31:06,605
Go for it, Wang!

702
01:31:27,405 --> 01:31:30,105
- Go!
- Come on, Jack, hurry!

703
01:31:32,305 --> 01:31:34,705
There's my truck... My truck!

704
01:31:34,905 --> 01:31:37,305
Get in.

705
01:31:59,005 --> 01:32:03,905
- They took the key.
- Do you have a spare?
Course I do, but it's underneath the...

706
01:32:06,705 --> 01:32:10,305
- What was that?
- 6.9 on the Richter scale. Hang on!

707
01:32:18,905 --> 01:32:22,905
- Sorry.
- Don't you know how to drive this thing?
Relax.

708
01:32:37,205 --> 01:32:39,405
Stop! Red light!

709
01:32:43,605 --> 01:32:45,905
Take it easy. OK, we made it.

710
01:32:47,605 --> 01:32:48,705
Yeah.

711
01:32:48,905 --> 01:32:52,805
Look at that.
Doesn't that make you feel good?

712
01:32:53,005 --> 01:32:55,005
Terrific.

713
01:32:56,505 --> 01:32:58,805
The light's green. You can go.

714
01:33:17,305 --> 01:33:22,805
- What are you doin', Jack?
- I'll be right back.
Where are you goin', Egg?

715
01:33:23,805 --> 01:33:25,805
My work's done.

716
01:33:26,605 --> 01:33:30,305
Lo Pan is dead and the evil spell's been lifted.

717
01:33:31,605 --> 01:33:34,905
Years ago I promised myself a long vacation.

718
01:33:35,105 --> 01:33:37,005
It is time to collect.

719
01:33:37,205 --> 01:33:40,405
Well, why don't you go on over to China?
Visit the motherland?

720
01:33:40,705 --> 01:33:45,105
Well, China's in the heart, Jack.
Wherever I go, she's with me.

721
01:33:47,805 --> 01:33:51,905
- So what are you gonna call it?
- I don't know.

722
01:33:52,105 --> 01:33:57,105
Maybe you can come over to my place later
and help me find a title?

723
01:33:59,405 --> 01:34:05,205
- Here, Jack. Nothin' or triple.
- Nothin' or double.
Triple. You earned it.

724
01:34:05,805 --> 01:34:08,405
You're right, I did. Thanks, Wang.

725
01:34:11,805 --> 01:34:14,305
Well, last chance. I'm a rich man now.

726
01:34:14,505 --> 01:34:18,105
I can give up the open road,
sell my truck, settle down.

727
01:34:18,705 --> 01:34:21,257
Couldn't have that on my conscience.

728
01:34:21,405 --> 01:34:24,105
The only way it might work
is if you buy a bigger truck

729
01:34:24,405 --> 01:34:27,705
with a cosy little apartment
in back, just big enough for two.

730
01:34:27,905 --> 01:34:33,105
That sounds pretty great. But sooner or later
I rub everybody the wrong way.

731
01:34:35,305 --> 01:34:37,505
Well, let me think about it.

732
01:34:41,405 --> 01:34:45,005
God, aren't you even
gonna kiss her goodbye?

733
01:34:49,005 --> 01:34:50,505
No.

734
01:34:52,705 --> 01:34:55,705
- See you around, Burton.
- Never can tell.

735
01:35:00,905 --> 01:35:02,905
Bye, Jack.

736
01:35:06,505 --> 01:35:09,705
We really shook the pillars of heaven,
didn't we, Wang?

737
01:35:09,905 --> 01:35:12,505
- No horseshit, Jack.
- No horseshit.

738
01:35:34,705 --> 01:35:38,205
You just listen to the Pork-Chop Express
and take his advice

739
01:35:38,405 --> 01:35:42,205
on a stormy night, when the lightning's
crashin', the thunder's roarin',

740
01:35:42,505 --> 01:35:46,105
and the rain's comin' down
in sheets thick as lead.

741
01:35:46,305 --> 01:35:49,105
Remember what old Jack Burton does
when the earth quakes

742
01:35:49,405 --> 01:35:54,105
and the poison arrows fall from the sky
and the pillars of heaven shake.

743
01:35:54,405 --> 01:35:59,105
Yeah, Jack Burton just looks that big old
storm right square in the eye and he says

744
01:35:59,405 --> 01:36:02,905
"Gimme your best shot, pal. I can take it."
