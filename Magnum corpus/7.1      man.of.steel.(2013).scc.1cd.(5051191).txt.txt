I do not understand.
Krypton's core collapses and fish.
We may have just a few weeks.
I warned. A core harvest was suicide.
Accelerate the implosion.
Our energy reserves are exhausted.
What you wanted to do, he? Let's look at the stars.
As they did of our ancestors. A world where we can reach habitat.
We can use outposts. You can suggest
evacuate the entire planet?
No, everyone here is already dead.
Give me control of the codex.
I will ensure the perpetuation of our species.
There is still hope. I kept that hope in his hands.
This council was dismissed.
Under whose authority? Mine.
The rest of you will be judged and punished accordingly.
How are you, Zod? This is crazy.
What should I do with years ago.
Ace're maker of laws, with their endless debates ite

And if your forces fail, you will be the leader of anything.
Then join me up. Help me save our race.
We start something new. We interrupt
degeneraþilor line that brought us here.
And who decides what line survives?
You?
Do not do this, El. Last thing I want it
is that we should be enemies.
You've abandoned the principles that bind us.
You raised the sword against your men.
I honor the man you once were, Zod,
and not the monster you've become.
Luaþi-l!
Sir, everything is okay? Get out of the way.

Lara calls her.

It is instead an intelligent populations.
It will be an outcast.

He'll die there alone.

Do you have any last words?
Nu vei not Omori. E º these deja mort.

Jor-El was right. Are you some fools.
To the last.
ªi tu...
Do you think your son is safe?
I'll find!
Voi revendica
what you stole!
I'll find him.
I will find Lara.
I'll find!
Think you Lara, where do you find refuge.
There is no refuge.
Jor-El was right.
This is the end.
Make a better world than ours.
Careful, fool. Keep eyes open them!
Unde-au gãsit naiba you?

Greenhorn!
We have no oxygen. I do not know how we can resist!
This Coast Guard 6510. We'll make a pass
And leave.
Wait. We helipod people!
We have to go!
Wait! What are you doing?
Du-te!
When Kansaul became ...
Clark...
I listen?
Te.am asked who set up Kansaul.
Clark, e º ti thousand?
Clark!
Clark!
Clark!
Clark, get out of there!
Leave me alone!
Clark, am sunat-o pe mama ta.
I'm here. Clark, the mother.
Would you open the door?
His parents did not even let him play with other children.
Darling, how can I help if I do not you let go.
The world is too much, Mom.
Then, do it less.
Focus on my voice.
About Poth sciences?
I see. Then, go for it.
What's wrong with me, Mom?
Clark...
Carp ... What do you think? Are you in?
Leave him in peace Pete. What are you? Girlfriend?
I want to hear what he has to say.
Heath!
My son was there. It was on the bus.
Clark saw what he did.
I'm sure it did.
I'm sure he thinks he saw. It was a Divine act, Jonathan.
That was wisdom.
I'm exaggerating a bit. No.
ªi Lana a vãzut.
Not the first time that Clark is such a thing.
I just wanted to help. I know, but we discussed it.
No? We discussed this.
Clark, should you hold this secret part of you.
What should I do? Let them die?
Maybe ...
Clark is more at stake here than the lives recognition.
I am and lives of others.
When the world ... When people find out what you can do
will change everything.
Beliefs, notions about ...
what it means to be human and all.
You saw how his mother reacted Pete.
He was scared, Clark.
Why? People are afraid ...
what they do not understand.
Is he right?
God made me this?
Tell me!
I found in it.
I was sure the government will come to our doorstep,
but no one came.
That was in the room with you.
I took her to metals research center in Kansas
And they said they would be made of any metal
do not exist in the periodic table.
Is another way of saying that it is not of this world.
And here's you.
You're the answer, son.
Are you on whether we are alone in the universe.
I want to be. I do not blame you, son.
It is a burden to anyone.
But you're not anyone, Clark. You must think you're ...
You're sent here for a reason.
All stages are through now, someday ...
you'll find a blessing and when that day comes,
You have to make a choice.
Choosing to stand proud in front of the race or not.
Still I can not pretend I'm your son?
But you're my son.
But somewhere out there ...
you have another father who gave you another name.
And you were sent here for a reason, Clark.
And even if I'll take the rest of your life,
find out what that reason.
I know, it's crazy, right?
And Americans are there. Many.
We call an object ...
Back, seriously.
Haide, Gracie ... ENDS!
Have a seat. Let go of me.
Hey, do you want to do this.
Ce e, Durul?
I feel like I'm asking you to leave.
I think I'll leave when I'm ready.

Thank you.
Good.
Miss Lane, how did it go?
Okay. What is your cargo?
How far is the train station?
Will lead you there.
Great. Joe can take luggage.
Joe, help!
Be careful with them. Heavy.
I have to confess, Miss Lane,
not a big fan of the Daily Planet.
.
It was very impressive.
What can I say? I bad writing unless I have an armor.
Drã Lane, colonel Hardy, Northcom,
dr Neil Hammilton,
You have arrived earlier, ma'am. Will wait tomorrow.
Why I came today.
But let's get something straight, guys.
The only reason I'm here is
For a Canadian company wants to keep me away.
Dhaka terminat am sane ne mãsurãm sculele,
You can ask people to show me what they got?
NA ª A satellite anomaly caught first.
No looks great thing ecosunete
but surely there is something down there.
It may be a Soviet submarine.
The depth is 300 m
Much bigger than any could have built then.
And that's the weird part.
Ice surrounding the subject
is 20,000 years.
On this night the temperature reaches -40 degrees.
.
We go.
What if I need to relieve?
It's a bucket corner.
Alo!
It's all right.
It's all right.
Ai hemoragie.
If not I'll cauterize bleeding.
How do you do? I can do things that other people can not.
Hold my hand. It will hurt.
What Colonel Hardy and his team believed to be a Soviet submarine,
was something much more.
An isotopic analysis of ice surrounding
suggest that stuck in glaciers
was there for over 18,000 years.
As one who saved me ...
object disappeared during departure.
A background check revealed
that both the past and identity were forged.
Question the existence there my savior
are frightening to contemplate. And I also know what I saw.
We concluded that the object and occupant
not originate on Earth.
I can not print it, Lois may have had hallucinations.
What about civilian contractors
That confirmed the story. Pentagon denies that it was a ship.
Of course I do.
That should do. It Pentagon.
Harry, talking about me.
I am a prize winning reporter Pultzer.
Then behave as such.
Public or leave it. You can not.
Oh contract.
Not publish a story about ...
and aliens who walk among us three.
Not going to happen.
A scotch without ice for the ladies.
I'll send the original article.
My editor will not print, but can occur online.
I got it.
But once you describe the site
full of untruths cancer?
I still maintain the opinion,
But I want the story there. Why?
Because I want to know the mystery man that I know the truth.
Diagnoza finished.

All systems are operational.
To see you standing there as an adult ...
Only if Lara would have seen this ...
Who are you?

What is my name?

I have so many questions.
How come?
Why did you send me here?
You came from the planet Krypton.
A world ...
with a much harsher environment.
A long time ago
in Expansion Era
Our race has spread among the stars.

This ship was one of the thousands released.
Outposts built on our planet.
Big cars to reshape our environment as needed.
For years 100,000
Our civilization flourished.
He made wonders.
What happened?
Informal control population.
Exploration outposts were abandoned.
We finished our natural resources.
As a result,
core of the planet has become unstable.
Finally, the military leader
Generalul Zod
made an attempt.
But then, it was too late.
Me and your mom have provided calamitatea.00: 46:42:
I made one and to get your ensure survival.
This is your genesis.
Kryptonienii Everyone could see such a chain.
Every child is made to fulfill a role in society.
A warrior, a worker, a leader.
Me and your mother thought that krypton is something precious.
We all had a choice. And chance.
As a child become something that society predestined.
As a child something to aspire to greatness.
You're the result of that belief.
The first natural born on Krypton, after many centuries.
That's why I risked so much to save you.
Why do not you come with me?
I could not leave.
Even if we wanted,
no matter how much I loved you.
Mama ta, Lara ºi cu mine
I was elected the failures part of our world
As much as Zod. Time and its course.
So alone. No.
Now you're a child of the Earth as long as you're the kryptonite.
Can you embrace the best of both worlds.

People on Earth are diferiþi us.
But I think this is a good thing.
There is no need to make the same mistakes as we are.

There are so diferiþi them.
Sun Earth is younger and brighter.
Our strength comes from solar radiation.

But while ...

How do you find someone who has spent a life-and to cover his tracks.

Everyone friends or girlfriends who claim to have seen.
For some, it is a guardian angel.
For others a mystery, a ghost who could not integrate.
How are you and cut your way while

What? I do not want my story to be told.
Eventually you come out to light.
Someone taking a picture and realizes its where you live.
And then I disappear again.
The only way to disappear is to never help people
And feel that this is not an option for you.
Dad thought ...
that if the world knew who I really am ...

They will fear me.
I'm tired to be sure.
I want to do something useful with my life.

Listen to you breathing.
It was hard for you.
Fight.
I always worry about you.
You were afraid that the truth will come out in the open.
No.
The truth about you?
I saw it the moment I laid eyes on you.
I knew that one day the whole world will see it.
I'm just ... I am worried that I will take.
Do not go anywhere, Mom.

For a while your world has lost one of my citizens.

The whole world is threatened.
It is time you hold the integrity of journalism.
This is serious, Lois.
The FBI is here. Formulate charged with treason.

According to officials, visitors do not present a threat.
Yet it is a question on everyone's mind.

I know you wanted. A part of me wanted.
But then what was?
You would feel better?
You have to decide what kind of man you want to be, because ...
that character will be good or bad,
will change the world.
What are you thinking?
I do not know where to start. Where you want.
The ship appeared last night ...
I am the one you seek.

Why would you? No.
But this general Zod,
even if I teach, there is no guarantee that, and will keep the word.
This sound loop ° salvez Earth predându-han.
You should take advantage of it?
What your God tell you?
Zod is not reliable.
Problem this ...
I'm not sure that people on Earth can be trusted.
First you have to trust.
Part of the confidence comes later.
