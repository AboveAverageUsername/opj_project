"The assassination of Trotsky"
In the Revolution there
compulsion, only circumstantial.
Revolution occurs only
when there is no other way out.

The uprising, in this situation,
was unprecedented.
Due to my fight

against domestic policy

My statements,
from the past ...
are reproduced in all

dissatisfaction within the USSR
is growing.
So  Stalin ordered
its agents ...
to killing me,
as quickly as possible.
Continue.
Yes, sir.
Today, when the true

When the Union of Soviet

See, Sieve, the little ones?
Life is worth struggle.
Stalin do not strikes
at his enemies ideas..
but want to eliminate them.
Do you what to do here?
Not bored?
It's hard living with
an old revolutionary.
You should be with us when

I got've done with

What man of action

What do you think?
Here has a wonderful
control of violence ...
color and font.
Do not you think?
This operation may not
work. There are not professionals.
It doesn't matter.
Some objective will have been achieved,
some fronts like painting.
Workers, citizens were
organize in this country ...
They have shown their
hostility to Trotksy.
That will still be
a serious buisness.
You do not talk.
What goes on behind
these quiet ...
blue eyes?
-You want me to talk?
yeah sure the girl?
Yes
She goes to the house?
-Yes.
Have you ever been there?

You not answered
my question.
What was that?
You want me to die?
-No.
We all want

The old keeps me busy.
You know about dreams?
What are not in fun state
God, has someone cut
your tounge out?
Why do not like this?
It's the altitude?
Is It something do you to eat?
I do not think
you have see Trotksy.
What do you call this?
Import and export?
I do not think why you should
worry about the work.
I know that you are Belgian.
Monsieur Jacques Monard.
Mr. Frank Jacson.
But the war is
a capitalist game ...
-my little capitalist.
-I am not Belgian.
I am Canadian.
I do not care who you are.
Look Mediterranean to me.
One of those lovely dark men.
What?
Why do you spell Jacson,
without a "k" in your passport?
-Do you want to talk?
-I want.
About what?
Go to rape me?
Good morning.
Read the City Hall article
this morning in the newspapers .
You do not know how
they got in?
No.
-They let them go.
"It is not possible.
-By one of your men.
Who?
It was seem by the Police.
Then why did'nt
they stop them?
-Your man, Sheldon Hart ...
-No.
He went with them.
"It is not possible.
Then what is your theory?
Isn't it possible ...?
-How ...
If I may be allowed continue,
without interruption ...
My wife Natasha
and I were in the bed room ...
when we heard the sound firing.
Immediately we
threw ourselves under the bed.
Natasha tried to protect me
with her body.
I made a lie down.
which is That's saved us.
You threw themselves down?
beside-beside.
But there were hundreds of bullets!
Are you Suggesting I am immortal
Colonel?
I am suggesting you
was not in the room.
You was warned.
By the way you achieved a certain sympathy.
And how do i achieve my own death?
What aim could i possibly can achieved,
I venturing ...
in an act so dangerous?
Why? what for?
I would have risk my own fate,
the fate of my family ...
my political reputation.
The reputation of people
whom I serve.
What did I  stand to gain?
Luck was on the side of justice.
The intruders were incompetent.
Then why didn't one of your guards
not fire back?
They are Americans.
Perhaps, they have too much respect for
police uniforms.
You trust them?
completly.
In my profession,
you learn to trust, Colonel.
-I love that boy.
-He may be dead.
He w'not cover up.
Anything else but this.
There are murders in the city,
saboteurs.
You know them.
Arrest them.
You have a theory
who was responsible?
I must Certainly do.
Joseph Stalin.
Come on.
Of the 12 apostles, only Judas
was a traitor, but ...
if he had
a quiet power ...
He already left,
would have been the traitor.
How I love you, Natasha.
My only one, faithfull, one my eternal ...
One my love, my victum.
You always carrying me
on your shoulders ...
as you carrying me
throughout our lives.
You can be alone now.
Most of our
friends will be arrested.
But I will not arrest you,
you are a businessman.
-You will survive.
-Where will you be?
-I have had my falure.
-It was not yours.
It might have been a success,
such a dialectical.
Now a days there is a popular feeling
against Trotsky.
Not just one madman
with a gun.
-What will happen?
When?
To you?
I'm not important.
I be looked after.
And if the next attemp
is a success ...
It even be looked after
very well.
It is a peculiar situation.
If the Soviet Union goes,
everything goes.
Be overturned.
Stalin is realistic.
If the Soviet Union win
Stalin has to the real issue.
This can only be done by some sacrifice
of all principles.
Trotsky is an idealist.
He dreams of the perfect International
Workers State.
We all do
But we are up again gangisters , armies!
Trotksy says he wants
the Soviet Union defended.
But wants he would bring down
Stalin's government
in the name of
Marxist principles!
This would mean civil war.
That would defeat us.
Look at your Spanish!
yes
It was not the fascist
who owns us, but the Trotskyists!
And now, with the fascists
over the Europe ...
It might happen again.
-I know of this.
"But you do not know is Trotsky.
Trotksy is still has
certain power ...
even he is alone, persuades
people all over the world.
Look at his guards:
They might have been college boys
Sweden, Germany.
It will not persuade me.
Not like the police, the press.
Trotksy was once the most popular man
in Russia.
He is equal to Lenin.
But forget it now.
But you don't have to do it.
Its your choice.
Well  Anyway,
we should have a federal think.
He is not the only one.
I also know persuade.
And I will not be alone.
There are some things to handle.
For these hands.
Go through here.
And I'm not important.
now shot?
you could just sitdown?
You are using my
try.
For God sake, you men!
You men!
I do not understand.
And they all seem to be playing.
I think there is something going on
, somewhere ...
Behing my back,
and no one will tells me about.
What is it?
You don't seems to be  interested
in living.
Why does man not
closer to the horns?
-He 's scared?
-He doesn't get scared.
He does.
They do not leave the
oxes being killed ...
they take them out, treat them
and put them back again.
Why only bind
for the oxes?
What do you like it?
Blood?
-Shut up.
What?
-I have never seen people ...
"Go away!
What?
Its stupid, if you want to see
bullfighting, look!
You have never seen people
having so much fun!
Jacques!
damn to your oxes!
Why not learn
about things? The reality?
You think fighting since
committees, reviews ...
and let the world rot,
for your own sport.
I will not,I will not
I be different.
Jacques!
-I am not Jacques!
I know.
-you know nothing!
This can not be decided now.
Seventeen years after the event ...
Whether or not the deaths in Kromstadt,
which will my responsibility ...
be justified
by history or not.
I been was fotological.
correct or not."
The civil war is not a
school for human behavior.
Idealists and pacifists always
blame revolution for excesses.
But the excesses bring from
nature of the revolution ...
Which is, in itself,
an excess history.
Those who wish to do so they
reject the revolution.
I do not reject.
-They haven't found?
-No.
And how is your family, Sheldon?
This is not the time, for my friends
and idealists who have left ...
to exsumed double their
amount of moral if you could heard
the same way
a man, feare ...
present double the amount of its
normal perspiration.
I do not let him trust you,
Sheldon.
Sheldon ...
Otto, I mean, Otto.
I trust that I will earn
my place in history ...
Beside Lincoln, the
American Civil War.
History has
different measures.
The slave owner used
his cunning and violence ...
to chain the slaves ...
and the slaves used cunning and
violence to break chains.
Only contemptible eunuchs,
would say they are equal
before a court
morality.
Only contemptible eunuchs
would say that they are equal.
before a court
morality.
-You can repeat the final?
"History has different measures ...
The slave used
cunning and violence ... "
Not after!
"Okay?
-All right.
And the slaves used cunning and
violence to break chains.
Only contemptible eunuchs
would say that they are equal.
before a court
of morality.
"All means are acceptable,
to lead to the true libration
of mankind. "
-Are mandatory.
"They are only acceptable if they lead
the unity of the worker. "
Or help them fight
against oppression.
Therefore, not all
means are acceptable.
You still hav'nt found
the leader of the attack?
Sealed doors, shutters
windows, new balconies.
It will come as
easily next time.
We live in a submarine.
With my faithful periscope: Natasha.
No more money
my books in France, is not it?
Oh, France.
None of this, or what,
but understanding.
"Of course, all with
purpose of order ...
-Nazi conquest of Europe. "
-Before Hitler was defeated ...
There are many in
Europe who will be viped out.
Great tragedies of our times
are working for us.
We are all exiles now
Marguerita.
I am very grateful for having
Sieve France taken in time.
-Sieva miss you.
-perhaps less than me.
Let's drink a Sieve.
A future revolutionary.
We hope..
You know why Catarina,
the Great, died?
In his laboratory.
Reading encyclopedias.
I love it!
Sheldon?
Anyway,
we all love you
and not Trotksy.
He is an extraordinary man.
i think you have to see him.
He may need you.
Probably has a lot
people that flatters.
If you want an excuse,
for going in
can say is
visiting Rosmonds.
They will leaving soon?
yes
-How are they going?
-By Vera Cruz.
Well, I can go to Vera Cruz.
I could take them.
Would you?
But I thought you did not want to meet
Trotsky .
-I am not frieghten.
what you have been?
I want to ...
What?
For the same reason that it felt to
my loss ...
to take part in
great events.
my past now cuffs
me off from chances of action.
I am reduced to interpreting events
and trying to foresee their future course.
Lev?
Where's the food?
"I've had our food.
The food for the rabbits.
suppose to come today.
-What day is today?
-Sunday.
Sunday? in mexico.
We've all fattened
for the table.
It's so hot here.
It's like being drowned.
Fools!
Monkeys!
I'll give you something.
I'll bring soda.
Want to come in?
Why not?
I take it over from you.
Take a snap through there.
Will be nice.
you have  builting some building.
Sure.
That's good.
like these?
-What are they?
"Lucky Strike."
No, I prefer these Mexicans.
Thank you.
-What do you do?
-Import and export.
What, for God sake?
I need the faces
of the poor.you Know?
I be a nice communist
who will mixes up with you?
Well, there is one thing for sure,
you are not trying to get in.
You are about the only person in this
demn town that is'nt.
But I admire him, you know?
might be able to help.
Put him in touch
with one or two ...
This must have cost
quiet a lot.
In war times.
You know, I could be useful.
No politics.
too much talking politics.
Like a woman.
The old man like that.
I'll tell him.
Yeah you tell him.
Who was there to say that Trotsky
was hated only by Stalin?
Trotksy was hated
millions ...
of all nationalities,
all over the world.
We convinced of his
traitor's role.
Trotksy: encounter-revolutionary.
and Enemy of the working class.
If he have to die, or
be killed, I would personaly be pleased.
This does not mean
I would kill him...
or cause him to be killed.
The Mexican Communist Party does not
gives orders for person to be killed.
Trotksy is a political ,
not a personal enemy.
We shall open enemy doctrine .
acts of personnel terrorism .
However, if the evidence
that you have,before is true ...
If indeed I did helped in preparation for
the Trotksy revenge...
then you have every right
to make the logical assumption ...
I might been involved,in
the assassination attempt.
Okay, take a hold up now, Jim.
To be uninitiated it may
seem incomprehensible ...
that Stalin plea to the first
exile me...
and then should attemt to kill me,
abroad.
Tighten.
Tighten a little more
It may seem incomprehensible  ...
that Stalin plea to the first
exile me...
and then should attemt to kill me,
abroad.
I got it, Ed
would have been simpler,
give me a shot in Moscow ...
like so many others.
I'm Peter, a friend and
companion of Trotksy.
I am informed that Stalin sevral
times admitted ...
that my exile role was a  ...
It is a tombstone.
Jim, a man
come with a plate.
Have you checked the plate?
no i havn't checked any damn plate.
Who the hell are you?
He says he is Peter, come
fix a plate.
Jim, my  security chief in
New York. he is new.
He says he is a friend of Valdez.
I am Sam, the miniapalos Union.
"joined the rmy,
see the world. "
Who said you
could come in here any way?
He does not may like,to seeing
any body today.
Workman he is a friend..
What that?
The old man does not stop him
to see him.
All are welcome.
What else does he got?
IN MEMORY OF ROBERT SHELDON
MURDERED BY STALIN
Come!
The repetition of the attack
is inevitable. In what form?
Possibly once again, in the form
a pure terrorist attack ...
wher along with machine guns or bombs.
Look good.
Still alive.
By the permission of Stalin.
It is the desire of some.
I can understand that.
Health, vitality, strength, life.
I am death wish of your
modern religions.
I can lucky today.
I have get some money today
from Life Magazine.
When our friends?

Who?
-Gita and her husband.
-Later .
it is a the lion's den.
-Stop it.
doing my job.
See the animals understand.
They have premonitions.
I do'nt like you
talking like that.
Why? because I said
I was lucky?
Art is one of the ways which
man finds his support in the world.
No one has much chance
enter here ...
what is this noise.
-How are you?
-Welcome.
This alarm is very loud.
I have a little button
in my room now.
If i press it, I summons
legions of helpers.
I was so sad,
with what happened.
How wonderful!
You are wonderful.
Looks like a battleship!
Now no one can get in.
no one.
I can't believe
you're going.
All good things
start to an end.
Well,we'll see you in Berlin
Alfredo.
In the Nazi-Soviet State?
Not you coming?
-Just for a day?
-A counter-revolutionary?
I hear our friends
are outraged ...
About the Nazi-Soviet pact.
I think he come to kidnap me.
I think is understandable?
And my dear friend,i find it childish to deny
the Soviet Union the Title of Workers State .
Hysteria and Marxism are
absolutely irreconcilable.
They want to take revenge on Stalin.
Trotsky one Trotskyism,
without Trotsky.
I'm Sorry, I must work,
I can not come with you.
-Thank your friend for asking.
Are you sure he wants to take us?
Will the Stock Exchange
manage without you?
Yes
Why did'nt he come in?

-Is shy? from us?
Jacques!
-You call him Jacques?
He is Fred.
Fred Jacson. Jacques!
Jacques, come here.
He is shy.
He is been working to meet you .
-How do you do?

you're well-guarded.
Its Sieva he takes up the attention most
of my guards.
-I heard about our little trouble?
-Yes.
They wouldn't try the same,
thing twice.
Is a man-informed.
I think so.
Guita told me you're not
interested in politics.
I think the policy a rival.
Gita, he says
politics have its rival.
No, you are.
me.. Old men are dangerous.
If they are old enough.
"She does not agree with me.
-I agree with you.
Come on.
yes yes...
Come and see me after
you come back from Vera Cruz.
Goodbye.
"Au-revoir."
-Goodbye.
He won't talk about politics.
Should be more careful,
Comrade Trotksy.
Yes
can not, without disgust
and horror ...
read the poems and novels,
or look at pictures and sculptures ...
in which officers, armed
pen, brush or chisel ...
supervised by officers,
armed with revolvers ...
glorify the great leaders
and genius.
Officers armed
pen, brush or chisel ...
supervised by officers,
armed with guns ...
glorify the great leaders
to e geniuses ...
in which there is
the slightest ...
of genius or scope.
The art of the Age of Stalin
will remain ...
the most strongest expression,
steep decline ...
Of proletariat revolution .
-What are you doing?
-Writing.
-What?
-An article.
43 years,
my conscious life ...
I have been a revolutionary.
And for 42 of those years, i have fought under
the banner of Marxism.
If I were to begin again i would,
try to avoid this or that mistakes ...
but the main course of my
life would remain the same.
I should die a proletarian revolutionary
the  ...
a Marxist ...
a dialectical materialist ...
and consequently
an irreconcilable atheist.
The nature of my illness
is such, as I understand ...
that the end must come suddenly
probably through a brain hemorrhage.
If, however, I should be threatened
with a lasting disability  ...
then, I reserve
the right to determine ...
for my self the time of my own death.
This suicide
if such a term is appropriate ...
Will not any sanse reflect
despair ...
or helplessness
or holessness.
Whatever the circumstances
I should die utterly believing
in the communist future.
Natasha just come from the window,
from the courtyard ...
And opened it wider, so that the air may enter
more freely into my room.
I can see a bright stripe of green,
under the wall ...
and sunlight everywhere.
In addition to the happiness of being a
fighter for the cause socialism  ...
fate has given me the happiness
to be the husband of Natasha.
She has been
inexhaustible ...
tenderness,
love and magnanimity.
Life is beautiful ...
That future generations
get rid of all ...
evil
violence and oppression ...
and enjoy it...
fully.
Sorry. Lev Davidovich
