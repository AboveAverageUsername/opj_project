Multi Christmas lights,
under water tree,
What can I say?
We're a cautionary tale.
So that fact that you
apparently purchased,
And illegal great military fireworks,
and set it up in your home,
And nothing to do with huh?
I could have been
a contributing factor.
What about this?
That's was nearest form of light.
You're gonna get a knock
my pennies, mister.
A real knock.
Alright, let's go.
Hey kids.
What do you...
Where are you going? Huh?
Hey, Allison.
What's going on?

Kelly, what're you doing?
Tring to sell at least this part
for the Christmas for the kids.
What? What?
Wait. No. You're leaving?
You'll leave...
Oh, come on, it's not that bad.
It's not that bad.
Most of the smoke damage
was confine to the family room.
And on the bright side,
Hey, look,
You always hated that wallpaper.
Now the high pressures have completely
rips it off the walls.
We're gonna go stay in the motel
with TN and Twains.
Come on, Kelly.
Don't do that.
Don't let that...
thatjerk ruin our Christmas.
The only jerk ruining Christmas
around here is you.
Me?
Yeah.
Me?
I'm trying to save Christmas.
Really?
What is your favourite
Christmas memory?
Well, you know what it is.
I was 7 years old.
My dad and I moved to Alabama.
And... on Christmas morning we woke up
and sat on the kitchen floor.
Ate french fries
and drink chocolate milk.
Yeah. Exactly.
It wasn't planned.
It wasn't organized.
Nobody had to enter
into their blackberry.
Itjust happened.
Our family is so busy.
We have to plan things out.
No. You.
You are the busy one.
You said that your kids need Christmas
more than you ever know.
What they need gonna ever is you.
Carter wanted
to go Christmas shopping with you.
And he wanted to cut down that tree
with you.
And Madison more...
Madison's a teenage girl,
So she just pretty much ignore you.
But...
If you've been paying attention,
you would've seen it.
She just want you to know that
she's not a little girl anymore.
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, that's the massive thing
that's I'm pretty clear.
She just don't get it.
Christmas tradition are borned
in those little...
Chocolate milk and french fries moments.
And you can't control it.
We don't fit in the tiny little boxes
on your Christmas calendar.
Oh, don't.
What do I eat?
Wait, Kelly, don't. Wait.
Oh, Steve.
What happened to your house?
Did you have a fire?
Wait. Wait.
Are you telling me that
you're not even home last night?
No.
Tia and the girls
went to thier favourite motel,
I sent whole night
throwing little pebbles on their window,
And try to get them to talk to me.
You miss the whole...
That's nothing.
That's nothing.
It's like
the kids probably left it down here.
Last night.
It's just wire that...
Ah, I knew it.
You've been stealing my power.
Borrowing.
Look, it's an extension cord,
It goes both ways.
I was gonna shoot it right back
to you after the whole day.
It's fine. Fine. You win.
You win the skating,
the lights, the tress,
You've been twist up of
the whole time.
But you know what?
You're so of screw up.
And that doesn't change
because you...
You put some lights on the roof.
Hey, pal.
You're gonna be spending
Christmas alone.
Just like the rest of us
screw ups.
How do you like that?
Um...
I see you taking down all the lights.
Oh, you notice.
What you some kind of genius?
Apparently not.
I can't do it, buddy.
I can't spend Christmas without them.
Tell me about it.
This is awful.
It's killing me.
Hey, you know, Tia.
She's so stubborn.
She won't even talk to me.
I tried everything.
Maybe not everything.
Girls, come over here and
help us decorate the tree.
Mum, you're hanging the bulls
from the mini bar
And breaks the guy's bumper of a car.
Part of me for not being
in the Christmas spirit,
we're trying to make
the best of it, honey.
Yeah, you girls pick those books down
and get your butts over here.
Are you reading?
I'm waiting to consent.
Another thing he gave to us.
It's really good.
Yeah, that's not giving me
a high cute thing.
Maybe I should go to
lost school or something.
Hey, mum. Look.
Carter, get back here.
Come on. Carter, ger back here,
you little fart.
Mum, I'm going after
the busy guy. I gotta go.
Carter!
It likes a pet. Let's do it and go!
Mum, look at this, mum!
Mum, all these ways. We dance slight.
I beg you to let me do the end.
I can tell right away.
You've no feelings for starches.
Your3D sound is very bad.
What do you expect me to do?
The 3D sound and the feast of the corn...
We thought maybe you'll be...
hungry.
Tia.
You thought some lights and a TV dinner
would make up for all the crap
that I have...
Is that what I think it is?
Well, we don't have time
to do with turkey.
So we'd need a few things
from your cook book.
I got you this little pre-christmas gift.
I miss you so much, man.
Oh gosh, I could afford it.
I'd do ever for it.
Let's just say we're not going
to use our credit cards
for the rest of our lives.
You think it's easy?
Kelly, I'm so sorry. It's just that
everything got so...
You go along thinking you're
doing all the right things
for the right reasons and then...
One day you'd blow up your house.
You know, the curse that is
somewhere along the way
Things get outta hand.
To seem like your whole life
has gotten so louded.
The only thing you're gonna hear
was an empty house.
You're right.
You're right, and you're right
to the eve.
You were here to stand.
You all, you're alright to leave.
But I'm so glad you're back.
So I can date now?
Several... during war time... No!
But, you're growing up so...
I guess I have to get used to that.
Mr Hall, I take that you're right.
Yeah, I thought it'd be better.
Yeah, you better go and work it.
Yeah, might have.
I bet they kinda see our house
from space.
We never know.
(Car Horning)
Then again, maybe it will.
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.
You all have to go home.
There's no lights tonight.
Yo, but there will be.
Buddy, what happens?
I don't know.
Well, I told them Buddy was
a little short of lights.
And maybe they'd like
to come and help up.
How many people did you call?
You've no idea how bad
that I said in this town.
MTV has said that there's someone
down into the scoring our Buddy's life.
They don't know it took them down.
Which is why we're gonna put them backup.
Well, you just gonna stand there
you're gonna help me do this thing.
Hey, keep those torch lights on too.
Those are good too.
Hey, thanks for coming.
And you too, you guys.
Oh, beautiful. Good to see you.
Steve, you're doing that's my job.
You got a future in this.
Happy Holiday, everyone.
Suchin Pak coming to you live from
clover down Massachusetts.
Well, apparently the whole town
has come out
to see Buddy Hall, a local car salesman
to achieve the impossible.
He's putting the Christmas like
this place in his front yard
that can hopefully beat
Steve from Space.
Now the folks on my earth have been
monitoring this situation live.
Guys, thanks so much for spending
your holiday plans on that.
Hat's not a trouble at all. Actuall, this funny vessel's mum sto
when they were eating the biscuits.
So, we just... we just have a laugh.
Oh, good time. Good time.
Didn't they do it?! They're gonna
turn on the lights.
Alright, it looks like the moment
has finally arrived.
Come on, let's do this.
This is available. Come on.
Put your hand on it. Ready?
Alright, Buddy. Everybody ready?
Yeah.
I will count to 3.
1, 2, 3.
Oh!
You keep the works so hard and
you could be so disappointed.
I'm gonna go to get some candles.
Okay. Alright. I need plate.
Why don't you put on my phone?
#Holy night
#The stars are brightly shining...
Hey, dad.
I wonder it'd be great if we could do
this every Christmas.
What do you think?
Yeah.
Yeah, we can do some in tradition
around here.

I think maybe you could ask yourjob
back and then we could stay here.
Yeah, I like it too.
You do?
I'll get my job back.
I'll get the job back.
