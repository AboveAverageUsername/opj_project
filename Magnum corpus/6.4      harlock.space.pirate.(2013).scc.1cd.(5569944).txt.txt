U dalekoj buducnosti ili mozda bas dalekoj proslosti...Ljudska rasa se rasirila sirom galaksije, stvarajuci kolonije na dalekim planetama.Nihova populacija se sirila, njihov broj se prosirio na bilione.Ali resorsi su se potrosili, bela kuga je zavladala, i vreme ljudi je mozda doslo krajuRevolucija je pocela  za povratak kuci na zemlju.Ali planeta ne moze podrzati povratak mnogihVeliki rat za pravo povratka je poceo, poznat kao

I tako je nastala Parlamentarna struktura, "Gaia Koalicija", da privede rat kraju.Gaia koalicija je nazvala zemlju "svetim mestom" gde nikom nije bilo dozvoljeno da udje.Planeta je postala nesto zabranjeno, iako je stanovnistvo planete izumiralo.Ali tu je bio, covek koji se odupirao...i Nastavljao po celom svemiru.Svemirski pitat, besmrtik poslednjeg soja, u nedostojnom brodu federacije.Trazen Gaia koalicije, kod S-00999Njegovo ime je-Mzim ovu omladinu...
osecam da jedva cekaju da umres.
To je sigurno.
Ovaj grad je njesra
A i planeta je gotova.
Nije planeta, nego mi ljudi.
Ako nista bar sam ja gotov...
Brod sa emigrantima...
OVA vibracija, nije sigurno...?
Borbeni!
Mi smo gotovi,
Ostavi to mladjim momcima?
To je Arkadia.
Brze! pozuri! da ne ode!
Univerzum je tako velik
A covecanstvo tako malo...
Ali sa malim trackom slave
I tako pocinje velicanstveni trenutak,
Sto nije tako prosto.
Solarni sistem...
ili ide u zaborav
ili uci u nas nedogled
Mi vec znamo...
Ljudi su ocajno sami.
Culi smo da trazite posadu! Zaposlite nas!
Treba nam samo jedan.
Zasto si ovde?
 Zbog slave!
Pare!
Sloboda
Kako se zoves?
Yama
Samo nemoj da zaboravis tu rec
To je moto broda
Spremni za polazak!
Samo napred
Neka se KeJ postara za novajliju.
Zasto ja?
Ti si preuzela odgovornost.
Covecanstvo izumire
Pozuri i hodaj!
Cak ici i u napred je beznacajno
Nista se ne menja
nikako ...
Nestavi napred
nepriljatelski senzori su pronadjeni
MX201 je nasao rastuci izvor energije
Upozorenje!
Objekat se priblizava.
Prvelikom brzinom
120 sekundi pre udara
Detektovano prisustvo crne materije
To je cetvrti brod u Crnoj senci Arkadia!
Kapetane Harlok
Preuzecu komandu.
Kapetan naredjuje. svi na polozaje
Svi odmah!
Hej! skoni mi se sa puta!
Ti patrolni brodovi se priblizavaju...
Izvinite me

Znam sta radim.
e, cekaj,
sta to radis?

auto pilot iskljucen
kao da smo na zetvi.
Paznaja, Kapetan govori!
Sada cemo otkaciti unijin brod.
Aktivirajte crnu materiju!
sacekajte dalje komande.
Razumem!
culi ste, startuj sistem crne materije!
Prijavljeno je da je  MX patrolni brod,
Imao kontakt Arkadijom.
Agent F111,
Moras nastaviti po planu.
Taj brod...
Ce uskoro biti nas.
taj kliminalac nas terorise godinama.
100 godina potojimo i on nas nece zaustaviti.
Mora biti zaustavljen.
Gaia flota ce sve uraditi da to zavrsi.
Mozes li to?
Da gospodine.
Ezra,
Glavni komadanti su zadovoljni tobom.
Cast mi je gospodine.
Cekacemo na dobre vesti.
Njegov mladji brat je agent?
Mora da se dokaze koaliciji
nije tako tesko sluziti gaia floti
sta moze da krene po zlu?
jednog dana put pod noge
sreca isto moze biti nagrada
Nami
Zasto, Ezra?
Zasto je dat zadatak Jami?
VErujem mu.
On je savrsen za ovo.
Sastanak uskoro pocinje
Razumem.
ne interesuje me vojska
zelim da budem kao moja majka, samo posmatrac
Nesrecom,
Arkadija nema sistem samopopravke
taj deo je otkazao skroz
Van nase granice
Energija crne materije je neiscrpna
Nabavljanje potrebstina je tezak posao
Ovaj brod je sve sto nam treba.
koja energija crne materije?
Ta...
pre sto godina za vreme rata
Vanzemaljska civilizacija zvana Srbende...
Usavrsila je tu cudesnu masinu
ne znam na koji sistem radi
Samo su srbende znale da upravljaju sa njom
Ona je zadnja od srba.
Jedina koja je imala kontakt sa ljudima
Komunikacija ce biti teska
Mogu li da vas pitam nesto, Yatarane?
Naravno.
Jel kapetan stvarno ima preko sto godina ?
I heroji stare...
I nastavljalju istrazivati univerzum
Mnogo ih je sa dosijeom
Ljudi kao ti.
Ja...
Razocaran sam.
vratiti se onome sto je ostalo od zemlje.
Coveciji zivot je sekunda
Kad se rodi u ovo doba
mozes naterati coveka da radi sta hoces
u redu sam?
vibracije ce biti prijavljene
nema nsta sto se ne moze iskoristiti jos
sve u redu, nema problema...
dobro sta je poenta...
Prijatelji
sin...

Ti si ovde.

svi to zele.
i to je to?
Hocu da se dokazem.
gde to idemo?
cekaj i videces.
Koristi kamufkazu.
Dimensional Oscillation Warhead...
So this thing can provide all the energy we need.
Pretty neat isn't it?
Set coordinates of latitude 32 degrees 7 minutes
Longitude 126 degrees 4 minutes
Jim Dahl High Lands, east of the Wye valley at the southern end. Mark, please
Coordinates confirmed
Descending now.
We're initiating the task now.
Watch out for corrosive gases.
These are corrosive gases for detonation.
We need to complete this in one hour.
Just follow me.
Kane is best for this environment.
They are very useful here
Some biologists studied their special abilities.
What are they?
They can survive the gases without side-effects.
That's amazing.
That's why we start over.
Start over?
Regardless of where we look in the universe.
Aside from Earth...
They don't let their fellow humans be identified as their own kind
Everyone wants to go home
However, due to the Gaia Coalition the Earth became "a sacred land"
No-one is permitted to enter.
Going back to Earth is not gonna be easy.
Everyone said that humanity will soon come to an end.
Humanity is scattered everywhere in the universe.
Like a resurgence of species.
At least the last time
Did not want to do in their own lives
Option One,
Go back to the distant past...
The early days of human life
But how?
The Junction Point will unlock the harness of time
Where is it?
Somewhere in this universe
there's a place where time gaps are connected
free from the shackles of causality,
The universe from a continuous cycle of time.
Freedom.
But it needs a large amount of energy,
We need to close the Gap in the universe...
The one that is untied
That is...
If we deployed it in the universe...
2 million vibration bombs would detonate simultaneously.
It would unlock the "time of the end point"
Well, I acted like a captain.
The purpose of these bombs,
I still don't understand it
What if what you just said proves wrong...
everyone might be in danger.
I trust the Captain's decision.
though I don't really agree with his goals.
But we need to trust him.
What's going on?
I've never felt this before
Hurry! Get back!
That's not a rock formation but a Strata Serpent!
Oh, crap
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
Let me go , I want to go back
Don't be a fool, do you want to die?
It was my fault it fell in
There are corrosive gases in there.
You will also get involved in it
What about him?
Sometimes you have all the bad luck.
No way!
Captain.
They're withered, also the trees.
These species are not ready for Yama
These flowers can only bloom on Earth.
Mars is not suitable for mother's dream.
Yama
Stop it!
Brother!
Brother
Don't come over
Don't come
You're like this...
Tell me brother
What should I do?
Be my legs
take my place,
Walking, running in the battlefield
That is your...
Retribution
Captain you're heading to the steam geysers!
The Strata Serpent is active.
I need the Dimensional Oscillation Warhead to be in manual mode
You noticed it, didn't you?
As long as you're on the Arcadia, you're my crew.
That idea was stupid.
I'm not here just to join your crew,
My mission is to kill you!
Is this what you want to do?
The likelihood of survival is less than one ten thousandth of the task
Even if you succeed no one will praise you.
Only a fool would follow such orders.
You're on your own now.
Why's there been no contact yet?
There's no signal on any of the radio frequencies.
We can't confirm if they're still alive.
Why did the Captain have to get involved?
We would do the same in his place.
Trust in him.
Captain,
If you die...
I'm not willingly doing this,
I'm not...
Freedom
You said that when you boarded the Arcadia.
That is...
If what you say is true,
Fight against the shackles that bind you
If that doesn't kill me,
Do it again.
Maybe you can kill me.
I wanted to give you 2 or 3 punches...
But forget it.
What matters is that you returned home safely.
Fight against the shackles that bind you...
So, now we've managed to deploy a couple of the bombs,
We can finally go to on our next target.
0 degrees galactic latitude...
Humanity's Home.
Earth
Earth
Earth
Earth
The Arcadia is heading towards Earth's solar system,
And is now underway
Your Fleet has not contacted you.
Communications are interrupted.
Don't let them get close to the Earth.
Please allow us to use the "Kaleido Star System"
I will destroy the Arcadia myself.
"Kaleido Star System"?
Using collapsed neutron star material needs concentrated light energy.
a resource contolled by the government.
However, Harlock's Dimensional Oscillation Warheads can destroy worlds
His warheads need Junction Points.
which are not readily available.
Using the "Kaleido Star System" will ensure our victory.
The last time it destroyed everything.
Soldiers engaged in a never-ending war?
Your Lordship what's your decision?
The use of the "Kaleido Star System" is permitted.
Use all means to stop him.
Even if it's the best idea we've got it'll disrupt communications
I'm always prepared with battleplans
Like intending to abandon him?
How can you do this?
Gaia Coalition Command
Order to all warships of the Gaia Fleet
Entire Fleet, make ready to sail
Repeat, entire Fleet, make ready to sail
Unlock all warships
All ships, set systems ready for departure
Once Fleet co-ordinates received
Gejian Fleet, begin departure
45 minutes in the high-speed optical furnace. Re-fuelling completed.
"Oceanus". Configuration coordinate positioning now completed.
I was Fleet Commander Lu Wali's aide
According to the orders of Commander Ezra
The whole Gejian Fleet is to go into Jump
and then the battle begins
Waiting for your order
We will now engage the Arcadia.
Prepare for battle!!
Roger
Fleet Gejian has verified their coordinate links
Large number of asteriods spotted outside the area.
Begin Jump
My friends,
This is the final voyage of your journey
Confused?
I don't understand.
Red Alert! Enemy fleet approaching!
Most of the enemy ships are in front with a distance of about 36,000km
The asteroid debris should have been a good line of defense
How did they come from the rear?
They traveled here at sub-light speed.
A nasty trick.
Do we engage them?
Affirmative.
Let's give them a warm welcome.
Understand.
Dark Matter increasing to maximum output
Broad cannons ready.
Deploying turrets in active mode
It's really quite a grand welcome.
Arcadia's position still registering as ahead
They're heading towards the asteriod debris.
We're ready to force a breakthrough
They've activated the Dark Matter Shield
Guns are now in range of the Arcadia
We're awaiting your order
Wait...
Just a little more...
Brother
Now!
Fleet, fire at will!
The warships are shelling each other.  We're losing ships!
The target is nowhere to be found!
Hold your fire!
We have an emergency situation
A hologram?
A clever plan...
Arcadia spotted heading for Saturn
Commander
2nd Fleet, use Jump to get there
Ships within a radius of 7400km, a total of 136 enemy units
Very close
Were not safe yet
The enemy did a stupid thing.
Yama
Incoming transmission from Arcadia.
Using Gaia Fleet's access code.
Connected.
Brother
You're still alive
Please back off your Fleet.
Harlock's mission is not to destroy the Universe.
His plans go far beyond what you think.
Just listen to me.
Is that all you can say?
I'm very disappointed.
Disconnect.
Brother
Transport the "Kaleido Star System".
The collapsed neutron star,
Is converted into a powerful light source.
As long as it maintains its massive photon energy output then,
the Arcadia won't have a chance.
2nd Fleet 84-93
Flank the Arcadia on both sides
Use light to dispel darkness.
This will be a huge battle all over again
A powerful gravitational field has appeared outside the Fleet
What?
It's huge
I can't give you an estimate
Critical light
Irradiate!
Debris increasing...
Raising shields to maximum output
Photon light gradually in cool down.
Alert! Incoming debris impact!
Intense electromagnetic interference, cannot activate remote sensors
Approximately 2 minutes to reboot.
Report target's status.
Using full telephoto global scan and spectroscopic scan
Arcadia is nowhere to be found!
Disappeared?
No trace found.
Was it still a holographic projection?
How?
They were very close to the target zone.
Arcadia detected above!
What?
The battleships are too slow to turn around in time.
Heavy cruiser "Nei Lede" completely destroyed
"Ares" also suffered heavy damage
Close the gap between the warships. Immediate action
Gravitational perturbations from the Arcadia have changed
It's heading here...
The Arcadia is here
Yama
97% of the Fleet warships have suffered major damage
Including the "Oceanus", only 17 ships are functioning
Try to hold on
Brother, it's useless to resist
Gaia Fleet's flagship looks very 'inspiring'
You need to abandon it
The "Oceanus" will be used to hold captives
Inform the Gaia Coalition that we have hostages
Good job.
Thanks to you, brother
You lured Joint Fleet Operations according to what I've told you
I'm only doing this for her
It's Nami
Keep her out of this
I want to take a gamble.
Humans can start over again
Thus, we have to...
Start over?
You don't understand anything
We're about to enter the Earth's field of protection
After a hundred years,
We return to our home planet
As a Junction Point in the Earth,
Here we can start over.
How do we install the Dimensional Oscillation Warhead on the Earth?
Earth is not meant to be blown.
The Captain will decide what to do.
Just trust in him.
Harlock is deceiving you guys.
When we enter the field of the inviolability
You'll see what I mean.
What's that?
A hologram. It's a holographic projection...
That means...
This...
Harlock committed a great sin
The blue surface is actually a holographic projection satellite illusion?
Captain
A hundred years ago,
Humans were scattered throughout the universe
and the Earth was the centre of a return to war
"The Homecoming War"
Tired of tragic human conflicts
The Gaia Coalition wanted to end the war
The Earth is our "holy land"
Regardless of what people do, this planet cannot be violated
Then, the Earth was guarded by the Gaia Fleet
Solar Federation Officer Captain Harlock was on board the battlecruiser "Death Shadow"
Harlock?
The Death Shadow was equipped with the Dark Matter Energy fuelling their warships
It was simply an armada
Planning to resurrect the lost alien civilizations
Harlock met Toshiro, a former Solar Federation Officer
They became good friends.
We told him the impending doom of our race, he wanted to save it.
We agreed to preserve our heritage
Harlock continued to defend the Earth
But the Gaia Coalition is giving special treatment to immigrant politicians.
That was the exchange for peace
Beautiful words can not end the war
But,
This man launched a revolt
and the Earth is the only shrine
It convinced Harlock to start fighting
He hated Gaia Coalition's betrayal
Toshiro!
So the Gaia Coalition turned against him.
Toshiro
Harlock was cornered.
He threatened to use the Dark Matter Energy
If Dark Matter Energy covered the Earth, then...
the Earth would truly be inviolable
That's how dangerous this thing is
It had to be prevented...
But it didn't happen as Harlock expected.
Dark Matter Energy converted the earth itself
The Earth was mercilessly devoured
And everything ended.
Everyone is gone,
But...
The man rose up
Not the same Harlock that we knew.
The ship had changed, transformed into a cursed pirate warship
By the end of the 5th year of war
The Gaia Coalition was pursuing him
and then Harlock disappeared
That purpose...
With the extinction of the Nibelung race throughout the worlds...
the Gaia Coalition would have come to an end.
That man...
Could not bear the burden and wanted to end all evil
Yama
What would you do?
What will become of the universe?
This infinitely large bubble called the universe...
A space node will act like a cork
If you pull the plug,
Everything will return to nothing,
Then be reborn again
So this is it!
No other way
Humans,
After all, the history of the universe appears only in a quick moment.
Whether or not, in the sense that it exists,
There still exists hope,
Which can't simply be annihilated
I fear for the time
people will again target the Earth
The home planet that gave birth to all.
Back to that era of ignorance
which contains infinite possibilities...
But that Earth is useless now.
Doing it all over.
Earth is all we had.
But it gave me a cursed ship
It awarded me for immortality.
But that doesn't compsenate for those I lost
It's not your fault!
If only,
We could bring back the dead
Then all will be well in the world.
Kei
The restoration of Humanity...
How?
Harlock
Don't carry the burden by yourself
We are here to help you.
Miime
What is this?
We're moving away from the Earth
Who's doing this?
My friends...
You're betraying me now?
The "Oceanus'" engines are under way
They are in the engine room!
All the prisoners have escaped!
How?
Fast Report
Emergency compartment closed!
The captives are armed with weapons!
Don't let them enter the bridge!
You!
Kei said it before
Mediocrity is better to die...
Everyone is the same
Maybe someone looking forward to the end all of this
But,
So, is this your answer?
Probably...
You are immortal
Not all things can be killed
This cursed body is all that remains
Space Criminal Code S-OO999
Harlock
Has violated the Article 62, terrorizing and bringing terror in the universe,
You're under arrest.
Breaking news has been received,
Gaia Coalition has an announcement.
The 100-year-old fugitive who hindered the peace agreement,
Space Pirate Captain Harlock and his crew of 40 people,
have been arrested by the Gaia Fleet.
You are now in charge of the Central Command.
Brother
Where's Nami?
Stay away from her.
Why is he still looking for you?
Forget it.
I already knew.
Your heart belongs only to Yama
You know nothing.
The way you respond to me...
You want to eliminate hatred?
Don't say something nice!
Look at this
In my own way,
I've done this just for you
I regretted that day,
Why him?
Now you're aware of this
Your pain is not Yama's fault
I...
always loved Yama, your brother
This can't be
I wanted to eliminate your hatred
That's enough! Don't say it!
This needs to end!
Stop it!
I lied to you
I'm sorry, Ezra
Nami...
You're my favorite
I know that.
It is most likely you
Fool...
Fool!
Fool! Fool!
FOOL!
It's Nami's
Use this to communicate with her
A virus invaded her network
It seems
Her life support system malfunctioned
It's a pity
This can't be...
Ezra what did you do!
Look, Yama
This is the only planet where flowers grow
Your mother's flower.
Turned out strong. it blooms beautifully
I've tried to persuade Ezra,
To let me handle the greenhouse cultivation.
I hope you will look after these flowers too.
Even if you don't like it.
No matter how hard,
Embrace your own pain.
If possible,
break through it
And also,
Ezra has been always at my side
His gentleness made ??me feel at ease.
I chose Ezra.
So don't blame yourself.
Some day, if you meet that important person,
remember me.
We are family.
You look very weak.
As expected.
This afternoon,
You will be executed.
Your source of immortality,
The Dark Matter Energy has failed you this time.
The curse you have been given will be removed.
It's futile.
What's your goal?
Could it be you want to re-do it again?
Everybody knows that's not possible.
I have to rely on others
In that case...
No matter who it is...
Good luck with that...
Freedom
Today,
Soon, the universe's Space Pirate Captain Harlock and his crew,
will accept the merciful gift of the death rituals of Gaia
The communications network between galaxies, live from the Gaia Coalition, will broadcast the event.
By now most of the Elders have taken their offical positions
High Supreme Court of Gaia
Order and peace
Order and peace
Our Home planet
Mother Earth
Gaia
who scattered her children throughout this universe
shines forever
Her children sleep
Until that day
Even if...
It's as fantastic as...
Their nonsense speeches are just a waste
We're just puppets to him
You guys already know it
What did you say?!
I have a plan.
What is it?
Obviously we have no place on this planet,
only on the pirate ship.
There's this problem,
What is it?
The Captain doesn't care if we live or die.
You're just like Yama
You're worse!
You're not qualified to complain!
Like you, I'm also
desperate to explain the Captain's objectives
Execution will commence
Guard ship to main exit
Repeat
Guard ship to main exit
Hey, we've been ordered to fall back
What's with that guy?
Commence field collapse
Commence Singularity, maintain barriers
Osmotic field on, quantum gravity diverse state maintained
Spatial collapse rate rising to predetermined level
Spatial collapse rate has risen to critical point
Reduce pressure
Breakthrough properties will begin shortly
Execution will start in
10 seconds
Pressure units have exploded!
All readings are off scale!
Dark Matter Energy released!
Get out!
What are you doing ?
I was wrong
Right now?!
Not only the Gaia Coalition is wrong
Harlock, everyone is wrong
Go down to Earth, you'll understand what I mean.
There's something I need you to see.
Why do we believe in this guy?
I'll tell you after this.
The guards will soon come
Let the ship escape
Hey, do you believe in him?
Stay here and you'll die
Come
I hate this
Switch to the screen inside the ship
Yes!
How is this possible?
Rebellion...
It was a hindered execution
Quickly terminate the broadcast!
Dispose them at once!
I understand.
Space squadron!
Obliterate all "Arcadia" crew members!
I'm not going to run anymore!
We need your help to escape the ship
Captain, fight it!
You said this ship is unable to move
Hurry!
Stand up Captain!
You may indeed have destroyed mankind's Home planet,
But you gave us shelter
That's the ship
There is no other place for us.
Harlock.
Please take a look.
This flower is
Earth's hope
Hey, how the...
There are signs Earth is regenerating
Nothing has ended, this is the beginning.
Even if we destroy the flower...
Fertilitize the world
No matter how many times you try to revive it,
Even humans can have hope
Repeat the event...
Forever
This is...
Freedom
My crew...
The Dark Matter Energy is continuing to increase
We're unable to absorb it
Where did the ship go?
In the direction it's taken...
...it's heading for Earth?
Mobilize all forces in the solar system
Prevent the "Arcadia" from going near the Earth!
What's the status of the "Oceanus"?
Repairs are not yet completed,
But it can get under way
Yes, sir!
Amazing, this ship moves by itself...
The coordinates of the Earth?
Could it be the "End Point"?
Yattaran
The Gaia Coalition is communicating over the galaxy networks
Hyperspace communications should be able to communicate, simultaneously throughout the universe
From now on the ship will be fighting against the strength of the Earth's satellite hologram
n order to reveal the truth to the whole universe.
Yama
Convey to the people,
The true face of the Earth
I never expected this...
Prepare the ship for combat!
I've lost count again
Our goal is the hologram satellite
Ignore them.
Yattaran, it's not good!
It's not that simple
They're removing the hologram satellite
Don't let them succeed!
Their central hull armour is critical!
Yattaran!
Alright then,
Come come come come come!!!
Linking to Gaia Coalition galactic communications network
Success!
Yama...
We can't avoid it!
This is the "Arcadia"
To all the people from around the universe...
Don't look away
See it with your eyes
The Gaia Coalition wants to hide the truth
The true face of the Earth
Because of past wars...
The beautiful planet was turned into this
Stop the broadcast!
But...
do not despair.
Earth is still alive
The land of the dead has regained new life
This kind of life is extremely fragile
But we must nurture it
In repeating the cycle,
Don't just rely on dreams.
Don't be afraid to accept the truth.
We can take our first real step.
We are not alone.
Even if our race is dead
Life will continue to grow.
Look in front of you.
Our last hope
All the life
In this thing
is there forever!
That's really stupid!
In this situation the order of the universe will collapse
Stop that "Arcadia" as soon as possible!
Do not panic.
The use of the "Jovian Blaster" is permitted.
"Jovian Blaster"?
For the sake of the "The Homecoming War",
complete your mission using this ultimate weapon
But...
The "Arcadia" is in the Earth's orbit
Earth will...
That sacred place is
No longer inhabitable.
We need to consider making it a sacrfice.
Please wait! Your Lordship!
Order the Fleet to fall back, Ezra.
Hostile ships retreating...
I don't get it.
That Gaia Fleet guy
Wants to give up?
One ship approaching...
The "Oceanus"!
Ezra
The ship is prepared to withstand any shock!
Why is this happening?
The enemy has grappled the ship!
Is it charged yet?
They'll pay for this!
Kei, are you alright?
This is not your style at the moment...
Yattaran!
I'm not running away anymore!
Ezra, where are you?
Get out of my way!
Rail loop electromagnetic poles on boot
"Jovian Blaster's" rotation speed increasing
Situation report update
Centrifugal-free transition to the excited state of atmospheric plasma
"Jovian Blaster" charged at 60%
Rotation rate still rising
Jupiter will gradually deform...
180 seconds before critical output achieved
"Oceanus" and "Arcadia" must keep each other busy
Proceeding...
Never mind
I wish we had more to spare
"Do not despair"?
You're now a saviour, Yama ?
Where are you Ezra?
You couldn't even save the woman you love.
You? Save mankind? What a joke.
I've got you now.
You are so naive
With your mother's flower,
In this situation you haven't any hope!
But the flower...
bloomed!
You're too late!
If not for you, Nami would not be dead!
That test beam,
was shot from Jupiter
"Arcadia", along with the Earth will be destroyed
You...
Captain, please go
Miime has been able to
protect the Earth.
She's doing this for a long time.
We can't completely control it.
The results from the test firing look excellent.
To end "The Homecoming War"
this is our only way.
Resetting almost complete!
The second plasma energy level now at 95%
approaching target value
Preparing to open the force field!
Hyperspace tracking locking on to the target
Targeting "Arcadia"
Automatic tracking complete
This one is the last,
There are enough worlds for us
After all, our life is not yet ended.
Harlock
This is...
Sorry Miime
For you...
It's alright.
I feel your sufferings.
Just continue doing what you believe in.
Even if there's a price to pay.
This is the only way to save mankind.
This can't be.
What happened?
They changed the course of the beam
Preventing it from hitting the Earth.
"Oceanus"
Ezra
Deflecting the beam from hitting the Earth
Instead it hit the "Arcadia"
Why?
I wanted to see
Nami's flowers
They're really beautiful
Brother
Brother!
While the Earth is recovering,
the Government will once again take all the glory.
"The Homecoming War" will happen again.
Using this will prevent that from happening.
Dark Matter Energy will be released.
Many will die.
You know it.
This world is Nami and Ezra's inheritance
Is that so?
If the Union makes mistakes again,
I will not hesitate to bring them...
Curse and terror
Repeating the cycle again.
As long as humans unite
There will be hope and freedom
This should continue to exist,
Forever...
This is the Planetary Joint Army
Place yourself by the bridge
You are advised to surrender
All survivors leave the ship
Quickly disarm yourselves.
If you refuse to surrender,
We will resume our attack
Harlock was right in believing in you.
The "Arcadia" will rise again...
The "Arcadia"!
Full sail!
Human's recessionThere is nowhere to go forwardAll is changedThe man will continue his legacyIn order to bring hope and freedom
