after suffering a wrist injury.
There's also Lt. Shin Yoo-hwa,
who scored highest marks
in biochemical warfare,
and microbiology in Germany.
Written and directed by GU MOSalute!
Sorry for bringing you
in during your training.
Sit.
Begin right away, major.
Yes, sir.
6 am on the 14th, a search
party was ambushed.
It took place in Sector 6031km
from Southern Limit Line.
Autopsy photos, it is presumed that...
Who do you think did it?
I can't... tell for sure yet.
With talk of a potential summit,
a clash in the DMZ will be a headache.
I want you to lead a special
detail to find out.
We've already selected your team.
Lt. Shin is the deputy?
That feels good.
Lt. Shin.
You're the best.
That was great work.
Really? You drank all that?
Go wash it.
I don't disrespect Lt. Shin,
but an experienced NCO
should take the role, sir.
You two went through tactical training,
and Mt. Gari infil mission.
This is not even main
mission, what's with you?
But if we're entering DMZ, we should...
What.
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
It's not fair that I got sidelined
because of this damn cast.
When do you remove it?
Whenever I want.
That's enough camo paint on your lips.
No bachelors in sight.
It looks like you got blood on it.
Near Civilian Control Line,dozens of dead chickens were discovered.According to the locals, as

on any given day.Defense Ministry has yet

Looks like chicken's on
our menu for a week.
Shift change.
Lt. Shin, I'm off.
Oops, this is yours. Sorry.
Later, Lee Hyun-suk.
It's Sgt. Yoo.
Come in.
Yes, sir.
Salu...
What?
I thought I was in the wrong room.
How's your skin trouble?
I was feeling sweet tooth, thanks for this.
What's this?
Make-up, of course.
Isn't that for chicks?
Lt. Shin.
Yes, sir.
Something going on?
Salute!
It's the list of members for the detail.
Briefing at HQ, 5 pm.
Are you injured?
Sir?
Sir.
Sgt. Han, did something happen in S603?
Who knows, let's head inside.
How was the field training?
No more shop talk.
Hey, Sgt. Han!
Salute!
Sure.
Sgt. Yoo, what brings you here?
Special detail.
Cpt. Jo's?
You too?
Am I bringing down class?
I'm used to it, Sgt. Han.
Who's the deputy?
Don't know.
I heard Master Sgt. Park is also selected.
The Grim Reaper?
So he's the deputy...
Let's find out.
Then I'm the junior?
Yup.
Hey, kiddo.
Pvt. Lee Jong-hui!
Have you seen a boar?
One stared through me during a drill,
but my swift kick...
I've been looking all over.
You must report to HQ for S603 detail ASAP.
Private, do your best, you'll be fine.
What are you talking about?
It's you, petty officer.
Me?
Yes.
I'm not falling for that again.
I did my duty.
Take care!
That chump...
Kiddo, I'll read this order form for you.
Mission Order Name: PO Roh Il-kwonWe've just crossed S883.
Let's introduce ourselves.
I'm Lt. Shin Yoo-hwa, deputy
chief of this detail.
Sgt. Han Seung-ho from
sector 3 infil squad.
Good to see you.
I'm in Sgt. Yoo's year, please be at ease.
I serve with Lt. Shin, Sgt.
Yoo of sniper squad.
Staff Sgt. Gu Yoon-gil from sector 3.
I heard you were 1st in
ATT drill, am I correct?
Yes, ma'am.
And you?
Salute!
Salute!
Salute!
Salute!
Shin Yoo-hwa...
Colonel.
Come in.
We have no idea what happened in 603,
or why the entire search party was killed.
We must uncover the truth
and eliminate the threat.
We deploy at 0600, when
GP 426's shift ends,
until next patrol unit reports at 0600.
Exactly 24 hours.
If we're entering DMZ,
what's our rules of engagement?
We must avoid skirmish, so
ROE is limited at best.
And as such, minimize your gear.
Check the gear.
Yes, sir!
Salute!
This is a covert op, so
light-weight loadout,
and silencers are mandatory.
Sgt. Yoo.
Yes, ma'am.
Add M18 smoke grenade to the list.
The smoke grenade?
Prepare it.
Any other required gear, ma'am?
That is all.
Yes, ma'am.
For this detail,
remove all insignias and unit badges.
Assemble at staging area,
0500 tomorrow, dismissed.
Yes, sweetie.
A gun?!
Salute!
Sweetie, girls should have ballet...
Okay, I'll head home early,
so have dinner with granny.
Salute!
Sir, please head out early.
I'll prep the loadout fit for the mission.
Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Where can I buy realistic replica guns?
Sir?
No, I don't...
She wants a gun...
My daughter...
I'm off, prep properly.
Yes sir!
Salute!
Salute!
I did not expect that from him.
Kiddo.
How long till your discharge?
20 days, sir.
Only 20 days left, but you volunteered?
Sir?
We got a hero.
That's not it.
I was the chief's radioman during training,
I guess I was assigned because of it.
Assigned, eh?
How old are you?
25, sir.
That means...
he's older than you.
Stay frosty.
Let's go.
Okay, I'm off.
Kiddo, no mistakes.
Salute!
They've been briefed.
I will not disappoint you for selecting
me...
I did not select you.
You weren't my choice.
You're not fit for this detail.
No prior DMZ experience.
Shin, it's not too late to bail.
I'll see you at the staging area!
Salute!
Cpt. Jo was an elite since he was a cadet,
so I understand fully why
he was picked to lead.
But why overlook Sgt. Park and
assign you as his deputy?
Hey!
You called me out to tell me that?
Lieutenant, this is live combat.
Frankly, what can a woman do in there?
You can't do much, and it's bug haven.
I washed this today.
Your birthday's in 2 days,
I got you a present...
That sass of hers...
Lt. Shin!
Come with me!
0508 hoursIs everything here?
Yes, Sgt. Yoo.
You have exactly 24 hours
to complete this mission.

trouble, it's top class.

So you're asking me to
check the radio signal...
Salute!
Between war room and admin
HQ, but why should I?!
I'm sorry, sir. At once!
Why am I doing petty chores?

This op may need to be
covered up on my end.
That's right, commander.
Lt. Choi, it's the
Milltary Demarcation Line.

It's quite eerie here.

Yoo, follow me.
I'll debrief when everyone
reports back, over.
We were thorough, but we found nothing.
No sign of hostiles.
Chief, it was the North for sure.
We must tread carefully.
It's floating grass from the swamp.
We must investigate.
See? It was on.
As we expected, there was a detour.But they're in pursuit of the target.At current situation,we can't disregard the fact
that all team may perish.
Yes, don't worry sir.We're on a tight schedule, you
can't just jump into a swamp.
Master Sergeant...
Chief!
Bleeding occurred within the hour.
Sign of being dragged.

Don't touch!
One of the bodies is Lee
from the search party.
Resume pursuit, flank the swamp.
Chief!
Move!
Chief!
Sir!
2 of those bodies are
from the search party.
Isn't finding them our primary objective?
Mission objective remains the same.
We evac after rescuing Han
and eliminating the target.
Potential biochemical target was sighted.
Rescuing Han is our priority, move!
Even if they find the deserted bunker,
we sealed it tight back in 2000.
Yes, don't worry, commander.
Why are you here, asshole!
How did you get in here!
I crawled in.
Since when? What did you hear?
What's all this?
Do you send in your men
knowing that they'll die?
Tell me!
Son of a bitch!
Pull him out!
Let go of me!
Let go!
Lt. Shin, can you hear me?!
Evac now! You'll die there!MS2 bateriophage, you'll die, pull out now!
The colonel is...
Do you copy?
Chief!
I heard an order for evac, and a gunshot.
What? Radio in.
Nest, nest...
No signal.
Chief, the sample from the swamp
is showing positive reaction to nervine.
It's a confirmation of mutation.
Tell us what's really going on here.
Regardless of the mutation,
and the war room gunshot,
our primary objective is
to eliminate the target,
and evac with Sgt. Han.
Was I excluded
from any necessary intel?
What?
The target we're pursuing may not be human.
Something unimaginable...
That does not change our main objective.
No, which is why I'm bringing this up.
What the hell is going on?!
I didn't come here just to die,
tell us everything you know.
If you're scared, evac to the GP gate!
4 o'clock, source of the blast.
Move.
11 hours until the end of missionChief, a bunker sighted at 3 o'clock.
Radio!

Sir, comm signal is dropping.
Check team comm too.
2-1, 2-1.
There's radio interference
surrounding this area.
Get off comm.
Our target and Han are
likely inside the bunker
considering all circumstances.
We'll move in and eliminate.
Chief.
We must stay on our recon route, sir.
There's no actionable intel
that the target is inside.
Attention.
State your opinions.
If you wish to evac, you
have my permission.
I'll take the heat.
How can we leave Han behind!
Let's do it.
Like he said, let's get Han
and kill everything in there.
Park and I will take point,
deputy and Roh take the flank.
Rest of you cover the rear.
Chief.
Please put Roh on rear
and I'll take his place.
Yoo, are you okay?
Sure, no problem.
They're entering the bunker that
Ministry of Defense sealed.
There is a blood trail.
We have to investigate.
Drop your gun.
Now!
Order your team to come out.
Come on out!
Sons of traitors, one slip
and you'll go to hell.
Wanna see them die?!

What's the post-op plan?Biochemical specialist is part of the op,
I'll make sure this doesn't reach you.
Yes, sir.
5 hours until the end of missionColonel! All comms and
video feeds are down.
I'll go in myself.
Have a squad ready.
Yes, sir.
We have to find our men at once!

Look for survivors and secure a radio.
Chief...
