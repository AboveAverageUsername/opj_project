K vragu!
Halo?
Prokleti rakuni.
Sranje!
Tko je tamo?
Ima li koga?
Tatice! Oh!
Prokletstvo Candy!
Koliko puta ti moram reci?
O ne.
Moji tulipani.
Zbilja mi je zao, Clyde.
E sada ce ti tek biti zao!!!
Ne!
O!
Kako si mogao?!
Mi smo zaljubljeni tatice!
Htio me voditi u Novi Meksiko!
O Candy, 
idi u svoju prikolicu.
Ali mi smo zaljubljeni.
Da. Odmah u kuću.
Rekao sam sada, kvragu!
Aah! 
Mrzim te!
Da pa,
to čini nas dvoje.
Prokletstvo Candy!
Dušo? Jesi to ti?
Chupacabra?
Aah! Chupacabra!
Hoćeš li molim te,
dati šansu našem putovanju?
Obećajem, zabaviti ćemo se.
Okej? Ha?
Samo mi društvo, ha?
Loviti ćemo okolo.
Kome pišeš?
Tvojoj curi.
Pozdravlja te.
Pa, ne želim biti davež...
..ali, bi li htio otvoriti prozor..
..ili ugasiti to?
Baš sam dobio ovu majicu
iz praonice.
I htio bih je nositi
više od jednog puta.
Ili napravi to, da
Hvala.
Tom, Jerry je iz New York-a.
Reci mu Jerry.
Da, 
ja sam iz New York-a.
Oh, zbilja?
Šta te dovodi u Texas,
Jerry?
Ah, Jerry je ovdije privremeno.
Samo dok ne riješi neke stvari.
Stvari?
Ah, kakve stvari?
Samo neke stvari,
koje sam trebao riješiti...
...kada sam imao šanse.
Reci, jel nebi bilo udobnije
ako stavimo tu veliku torbu u gepek?
Možda će ti biti lakše
jesti taj kikiriki.
Zapravo Tom,
meni bi bilo udobnije
da staviš tu veliku torbu iza.
Ja se samo zajebavam
sa tobom čovječe!
Tako si napet!
Skoro si upišao gaće Tom.
Ali da ti nikada nije palo na pamet
da diraš tu torbu--
NIKADA
Da li netko želi slatkoga?
Isuse. Šta-jel kolači
imaju fufu u sebi, Lance?
Pa, Mama, tko još kaže "fufu"?
Ja ću uzeti jedan, šefe.
Ne!
Dečki, hajde. Dobro?
Gledajte, 
moramo ići u grad prvo,
a onda se moramo naći sa Clyde.
Tko je kvragu Clyde?
On.. 
On posjeduje Buck Wild ranč.
Pa, 
ja sam sa tobom, šefe.
I koju god životinju ubijemo,
ja ću guliti kožu
jer sam dobar sa nožem
Prokleto dobar.
Clyde --
zvuči super, Craig.
Ehm, zašto ja moram sjediti iza
sa Jeffreyem Dahmer (serijski ubojica)?
Oprostite dečki.
On je obitelj, okej?
I nezna nikoga ovdije
Vjerojatno,
jer ih je ubio sve.
I nagurao ih u svoju veliku torbu.
Zbilja --
jeste vidjeli kako je
dobro pazio na tu torbu?
Tip je ravno iz nekog
filma u kojem je on ubojica.
I šta je to sa kikirikijem?
Kao da radi na novoj protezi.
Okej gledajte,
znam da je malo "napet"?
ali, dajte malo popustite
i samo mu dajte šansu, okej?
Oh, slatko.
Nisam ja za ovo.
Dobar dan, gospodo.
Jel mi se priviđa od nih kolača.
Dobar dan, hm, gospon..
Ima li problema?
Da, zapravo ima.
Parkirao si na mojoj pumpi.
Tvojoj pumpi?
Da,vidiš,
ja sam čovjek što ljudi ovdije
zovu "jebač"
izvan zakona zapravo,
i sa time,
zaslužujem određenu slobodu.
U ovom slučaju,
odabrao sam ovu pumpu kao MOJU pumpu.
I zato vas tražim,
da maknete svoj jebeni kamion.
Hej, Billy Ray!
Jedan se skriva ovdije!
Prestani se skrivati!
Prestani se skrivati!
Prestani se skrivati!
Gledajte gospodo,
Vidim da niste odavdije.
Pa ću vam dopustiti da odete dostojanstveno.
A da?
A šta ako nećemo?
Da,
definitivno su kolači.
Užasno mi je žao gospodo.
Uvijek gubim ključeve,
znate.
Ajmo probati ponovno.
samo malo.
Hej. ne želimo probleme, 
okej?
Pa, izgleda da imamo probleme.
Ovo je glupo.
Jerry, maknuti ćemo se.
Ili možemo ostati
A gosp. Kikiriki ovdije
i njegova grupa "Dixie Chicks"
mogu tankirati negdije drugdije.
Šta se ovdije dešava dečki?
Samo bezopasno
muško razmetanje, shipley.
Aha.
Izgleda kao par mladića
koji obilježavaju svoj teritorij.
I kaže se poručnik Shipley,
Billy ray.
Koliko puta ti to moram reći?
Koja je tvoja priča, sine?
Hej!
Poručnik Teksaškog parka
ti se obraća, dečko.
Lovočuvar Shipley?
Bok. Craig Thompson.
Ma, samo uzimamo benzin,
I onda idemo do našeg
vodiča na Buck Wild ranč.
Idete upoznati Clyde-a?
To je on.
Sranje. Kužim.
Pa, kada ga vidite,
pitajte ga da li je vidio
"Chupacabre" u posljednje vrijeme .
U redu dečki, magla .
I, Billy Ray...
Držim te na oku.
Vjerujem,
da ćemo se sresti ponovno
pisano je.
Šta je "chupacabra"?
Mislim da je rekao
"chalupa."
Rekao je "chupacabra."
To je legendarno stvorenje
glasine su da je nastanjivao
dijelove Amerike.
Ozloglašen chupacabra,
ili "Goat Sucker,"
pije krv svojim žrtvama.
Neki kažu da je samo
pobješnjeli kojot sa šugom.
Drugi se kunu da je čisto zlo.
Kako dovraga ti znaš to sve?
Pa, petljao sam prije sa
Meksikankom farmericom.
Bok.
Jesi ti Clyde?
Jesi ti Clyde
sa Buck Wild ranča?
Hm.
Moje ime je --
Craig Thompson.
Pa, ti si Clyde.
Drago mi je što sam vas upoznao, gospodine .
Lovočuvar,
iz grada --
me zamolio
da vas pitam o, uh, chupacabri?
Sine, jel se ti praviš pametan?
Hm, ne, gospodine.
Je li ti netko rekao
da Buck Wild ranč
prima aplikacije za pametnjakoviće?
Ne, gospodine.
Pa, onda ne govori gluposti
o kojima nemaš pojma.
U redu.
Da, gospodine.
Prati me.
Sve u redu, šefe?
Ajmo da to riješimo.
U redu,
ovo je tvoj vikend za bijeg.
Ja ga zovem "Raj."
Okupite se i slušajte.
Reći ću ovo samo jedanput.
Krevet je za spavanje.
Biljar za igranje.
Televizija za gledanje.
Ima svega 4 kanala,
pet ako se igrate sa antenom.
Raj, malo sutra.
Uuu, udobno je.
Ta tvoja lajava usta,
 dovesti će te u neprilike, sine.
Psst,
hej, dođi ovdije.
Stol za jesti.
Da,
nakon temeljitog čišćenja.
Tiho.
Ovo je kuhinja.
Za kuhanje?
Reci, kako si smislio
ime Buck Wild? Sviđa mi se.
Ako pogledate iza,
primjetiti ćete
roštilj za roštiljanje,
sjedalice za sjedenje,
I  4-x --
I 4x4.
Ima dva rezervara --
Izbrojite ih, jedan, dva --
i čekujem da budu puni 
po vašem odlasku.
Ne želim da itko
hoda gol ovuda, također..
Oh, no, sir.
Uh, ne -
Nema toga ovdije..
U redu, slušajte.
Ovo ovdije je "raj".
Ovo cesta kojom smo došli.
Imate
jedan, dva, tri, četiri,
pet mjesta za lov jelena
na Buck Wild ranču.
Možete loviti na bilo kojem.
Ali nemojte...
...ponoviti ću, nemojte
prelaziti ovu ogradu
Jer je ovo ovdije
mjesto od Billy Ray-a.
A Billy Ray je "jebač".
pa prokletstvo, Candy!
Nismo radili ništa.
Idi u prokleti kamion.
Ne mješaj mi se u život!
Sad.
Ufff!
Jel ti se sviđa Candy?
Hm, Candy se čini jako,
hm...
Slatka.
Prokleti komičari!
Svi vi.
Nepristojni balavci.
Prokleti jadni popišanci!
Pokušajte se ne poubijati međusobno.
Uh.
Netko za slatko?
Halo?
Hej, dušo,šta radiš?
Skidaj majicu.
Idemo u jacuzzi!
Prestani!
Tko je to? Gdje si?
Mike, mi krećemo!
Samo skini majicu!
Šta?
Ne čujem te.
Na fešti sam.
Dušo, sada je 16:30.
Da,znam to, Craig.
Dobro, pa, hm,
toto je cool.
Makni se sa telefona!
Imam drugi poziv.
Nadam se da se ti i dečki
zabavljate na vašem kampiranju.
Hm, lovu.
Aha. Dobro.
Moram ići.
D-dobro. Volim te.
Skidaj se sa telefona, kučko!
Sranje.
Hej,
imaš muinutu?
Naravno prijatelju. Šta je bilo??
Pa, hm...
Vidiš, to...
Lance.
Hej, znaš koji
je tvoj problem?
Brineš se za druge dečke.
Ne opterećuj se, prijatelju 
moj mali. Ovo će biti vraški dobar odmor.
Mislim, ne tako dobar
kao što sam ja isplanirao prošle godine
ali na drugom ili trećem mjestu.
Top 5 -10.
Hvala.
Vidiš,
t-t-to nije zapravo to...
...šta sam htio reći --
Evo i nje!
Sačekaj.
Hej.
Oh, ne,
Dobro sam.
Oh, ne,dovesti ćemo te u crkvu
na vrijeme
ne brini.
Zar to nije super?
Tako mirno.
Samo naše društvo,
jedemo meso...
...oštrimo noževe...
...okupljamo se oko logorske vatre.
Znate,
znam da neki od vas
bi voljeli da smo
otišli na neko drugo mjesto,
ali, hm...
Osjećaj je dobar kada ste svi
ovdije samnom.
Pa, nama je isto drago biti sa tobom
 također, prijatelju.
Iako je vožnja bila malo nezgodna,
ali definitivno
top-10 putovanje.
Imali smo samo
pet ili šest putovanja, Lance.
Začepi, Tom.
Hej, dečki,
Htio bih nešto objaviti.
Lance?
Samo sekunda.
Dobro.
Hm, čuvao sam ovo određeno vrijeme,
i, hm, pa,
u ponedjeljak ujutro --
[ screaming ]
Oh! Našao si si prijatelja, ha druže?
Koji je to kurac?!
Neznam.Udavio sam ga kod smeća.
Makni to od mene,
Lance.
Pa, ovo je --
ovo je nečuveno!
Ma daj Tom..
Prestani biti mali peder.
Znaš šta? Mislim da ću --
da ću ići u krevet.
Dobro, u redu.
Žao mi je, šefe.
Bila je to samo šala.
Daj, nemoj ići.
Ne, umoran sam od vožnje.
Sjedaj!
Pij!
Žao mi je, šefe.
Nastavi,
o čemu si počeo pričati.
Da.
Hm, da, dobro,
Hm, prije ovog...
sa mrtvom životinjom, hm,
Htio sam vam reći dečki
hm, da, pa...
Pitati ću Carlu da se uda za mene.
Žao mi je, Jerry.
Moja greška.
Jel to, 
ono šta ja mislim da je?
Da, Lance, ja --
ja ću pitati Carlu da se uda za mene.
To je predivno, šefe.
Pa čestitam čovječe.
Vas dvoje ste idealni jedno za drugo --
jednostavno -idealni.
Hvala, Lance.
Znaš da ćeš mi biti kum, jelda?
Uh-huh.
Naravno partneru, da.
Pa, hm... mmm.
Znaš, mislim da ću u krevet.
Da, ne volim baš jutro
a znam da ćemo se rano ustati, pa...
Zbilja?
Da, pa se vidimo dečki --
ujutro.
Pa, u redu prijatelju.
Laku noć.
Dobro spavaj.
Tom, jel Lance dobro?
Da je.
Tom?
Gledaj,
neznam je li istina ili ne,
ali me muči 
u posljednje vrijeme,
i mrzim što to kažem
a neznam dali sam u pravu,
ali onda opet
mislim da jesam.
ali opet --
Tom.
Mislim da Lance
spava sa tvojom curom Carlom.
Šta?!
O sranje..
Shh!
Šta to pričaš , Tom?
Okej, jel se sjećaš --
se sjećaš kada sam došao
prije par mjeseci
da donesem one DVD-e --
par njih.
I da kažem samo, "Love Actually"
je super film.
Tom!
Oprosti, hm, pa...
Ti nisi bio doma ali....
On je bio.
Pa šta. Lance stalno dolazi do nas.
Lance i Carla
su dobri prijatelji.
To --
to je predaleko.
To bi mogao biti bilo tko.
To bi mogao biti bilo tko.
Stvarno, Tom? Ha?
Dolaziš mi sa ovim smećem?
Ne, nije kul.
Nije kul, Tom!
Žao mi je, Craig.
Da, ja...
idem u krevet.
Jesi zbilja zadavio tu zvijer?
Jerry: Hej!
Sve u redu, šefe?
Da.
Nietzsche je rekao,
"love is a state in which
a man sees things
most decidedly
as they are not."
Thanks.
What that means
is that women are crazy.
You can't allow them
to twist your reality.
I mean, you've been with this
broad for what, a year?
Maybe two?
Am I right?
Six years actually.
[ Chuckling ]
Six years?!
Really?
Yeah.
All right, so you've been
with this chick for six years
and she's out
bangin' some other guy,
givin' it to him
every night
and then
crawling home to you
where you got to
pick up the sloppy seconds.
The worst part about that
is you don't even know
you're getting
sloppy seconds.
Man, I tell you,
that's like when somebody
puts a hair in your food
or spits in your iced tea.
All right,
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!
Nothing happened, okay?
I don't want to
talk anymore about it.
Look, I know
you're trying to help,
but...I'm fine.
[ Chuckles ]
Aah.
Hey, Craig,
need anything
to help you sleep?
I got a little something
that'll knock you right out.
[ Chuckles ]
I'm sure you do, Jerry.
Hey, Craig,
thanks for
invitin' me along.
[ Chuckles ]
Sure.
[ Injector hisses ]
[ Groans ]
[ Stifled ]
Good night.
[ Crickets chirping ]
[ Mid-tempo music plays ]
[ Door creaks ]
[ Door creaks, closes ]
[ Knife scraping ]
Hey. Candy?
Come out.
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.
Candy?
[ Clatter ]
Candy, is that you?
What the hell?
Do me, Lance.
Okeydokey.
Hey. [ Grunts ]
[ Belt buckle jingles ]
Careful now.
Easy now. Easy.
There's plenty of Lance
to go around.
[ Pants unzip ]
[ Moaning ]
Hey, is everything
all right?
[ Growling ]
C-candy?
[ Grunts ] Wow.
So, you want to
play rough, huh?
[ Growls ]
Wow.
Too rough!
Man.
Wow. Yeah.
Ooh! Oh.
[ Moaning ]
[ Chuckles ]
I-is that blood?
[ Chuckles ]
[ Guttural voice ]
Do me, Lance!
[ Growls ]
Oh, my God!
A-are you okay?
You look sick.
[ Normal voice ]
It's just the sniffles.
[ Guttural voice ]
Do me, Lance!
Yeah, look,
I should probably just go.
Big day tomorrow.
You know how it goes.
Look, now, uh,
I'm no germ freak
but you look like you might be
coming down with something.
[ Laughs ]
[ Clattering ]
M-my health insurance
just lapsed.
Health insurance?
I'm in between jobs
at the moment.
Do me, Lance!
Hey, you know, I think
I've got some cough syrup
back at the --
back at the old cabin.
I'll just --
I'll just go grab you some.
Don't you want
a piece of candy?
Yeah.
[ Growls ]
[ Screams ]
[ Birds chirping ]
[ Indistinct shouting ]
Shit!
[ Grunting ]
[ Glass shatters ]
Wha-cha!
Hoo!
What are you doing,
Jerry?
Training.
Could you maybe train
with a pair of pants on, huh?
I wouldn't want Clyde
to come by --
or anyone else,
for that matter.
Clothes are
too confining, boss.
They interfere with the
spiritual alignment of the body.
I tell you,
if it weren't illegal,
I'd be naked all the time.
Yeah, well it is illegal,
okay?
Even way out here.
Almost done here, boss.
How'd you sleep?
Good.
Uh, good. Good sleep.
You know...
[ Grunts ]
...I was thinkin' a lot
about last night, you know.
Then I started thinking
about how you've been
so good to me lately
and how I'd like to,
uh...
Like to do something --
a little something nice for you.
That's all right, Jerry.
Putting on pants is good enough.
No, no, no, no.
We're cousins --
family.
So I was
thinking about it.
If you want me to,
I can
take care of this for you.
Take care of what,
Jerry?
Look, you're a good man.
You're a damn good man.
You deserve respect.
But I can see that
you're...
A little sensitive,
a little weak.
But that's okay.
So, if you want me to,
I can take care of this
for you.
Look, huntin' accidents
happen all the time, boss.
I can do it real quick.
Lance won't feel a thing.
No! No! Jerry! Jerry!
Boom!
Jerry,
thank you, all right?
Thank you, but it's not
a good idea, all right?
At all. At all.
All right, boss.
Oh, you know,
y-y-you're such a good guy.
Wow.
Oh, hey, tom!
Jerry, do you mind?
I usually just
go shopping with my cousins.
Yeah,
you would, Mary.
Whatever.
Has anyone seen Lance?
He's not inside?
Nope.
That's weird.
Maybe
he went out already.
[ Sighs ]
Let's go, huh?
Deer blinds.
10 minutes.
Put some pants on!
[ Up-tempo music plays ]
[ Gun cocks ]
♪ Morning ♪
♪ morning to the other side ♪
♪ side waiting to see the ♪
[ Toilet flushes ]
What?
When nature calls,
I say hello.
I'll just hold it.
It ain't good
to hold it in.
All right, load up!
[ Indistinct singing ]
Stop!
Is nature calling?
Stop the truck!
[ Dramatic music plays ]
[ Inhales deeply, sighs ]
Here's good.
We're going to
the deer blinds, Jerry.
I don't like to
sit and hide in a blind
like some rat in a hole,
waiting for the onslaught.
No way.
I choose to
take the fight to them.
Offense, not defense,
baby!
You do know
the deer don't have guns, right?
Remember what I told you,
Jerry.
I-I-I don't need you to
take care of anything.
What?
[ Sighs ]
What was that about?
[ Gun cocks ]
Did you call Carla?
Please, tom, whisper.
We're hunting.
Did you call Carla?
No. I texted her.
And?
She didn't text back.
Yeah. [ Clicks tongue ]
She's probably too busy
texting Lance.
Don't be an asshole, tom.
Fine,
but I want you to know
I wouldn't lie to you about
something like this, Craig.
I don't think
you're lying.
I just -I don't
think you know what
you saw, all right?
Lance wouldn't do that,
and neither would Carla.
Oh, no?
Well, Lance is a slut.
And you know what? Before
the two of you started
dating, so was Carla.
You take that back, tom!
Why? You know it's true.
And you know I love Carla.
She's the only girl I know
who could pull off a perm.
But let's face it.
Before the two of you started
dating she had a reputation.
Craig! No!
Shh!
Don't be an idiot, tom.
Sorry.
Your cousin has me on edge.
My face is breaking out
all over the place. I'm
not built for this.
Are you gonna
kill something?
Yes, dumbass.
It's called hunting,
not bird watching.
Fine.
Just let me know
so I can cover my ears.
And I like birds.
Oh, I know you do,
tom.
[ Sighs ]
Look, I'm not trying to
ruin your weekend
or screw up
your relationship with Carla.
But if you're gonna ask
her to spend the rest of
her life with you,
I feel
you should at least know.
If I'm wrong, then
we can laugh about it later.
But if I'm right,
you're gonna thank me
for helping you avoid one of
the biggest mistakes of --
[ deer cries ]
Asshole!
Oh! Oh! Great.
Now my ears are ringing.
I better not have
permanent hearing damage.
Ow.
[ Growling ]
Are deer
supposed to sound like that?
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
What? What is it?
I shot Clyde!
What?!
Aah!
He's alive.
Help me.
Ohh!
Ew!
[ Growls ]
Clyde, can you hear me?
Look,
I'm so, so sorry, sir.
Tom, help me.
Uh, I don't know.
What's wrong with him?
W-w-what do you mean
what's wrong? He's been shot!
Obviously, Craig! But is
all that supposed to happen?
Gee, tom,
I don't know, all right?
I've never shot anybody
before, okay?!
Well, you don't have to
get snippy!
I just don't know, okay?
I'm scared, all right?!
I'm just scared!
Tom,
will you just calm down?
I need you to
come over here.
Okay? We need to get him
into the back of the truck.
We're gonna take him
to the hospital, all right?
Oh, he smells like shit.
Lift with the legs, okay?
[ Straining ]
One, two, three.
[ Growls ]
[ Gunshot ]
We don't
tell nobody about this.
Are you
out of your mind?!
He is out of his mind!
And I told you that
from the beginning! I said it!
I said this guy
is gonna kill someone!
And now we're fucked
because he's dead!
He's a fucking dead man!
[ Gunshot ]
NowAah!
Give me that!
Come on.
Oh!
I'm an accessory
to murder!
That's it!
My life is over!
I'm going to jail
and it's fine for him --
he's probably
gonna end up there anyway!
Oh!
He's still movin'!
How many guns do you have?
Stop it, boss!
Come on, I got to
put one in his head!
No! It's enough!
Aah!
Aah!
We don't have much time,
boss!
What?
Clyde turned.
There will be others.
[ Sniffing ]
What the hell?
[ Flies buzzing ]
That's the same deer
I saw in my scope.
Did Clyde do that?
They'll come for us.
What?
Zombies.
[ Dramatic music swells ]
Get ready, boys.
It's about to get buck wild.
Everyone get in the truck.
What are we gonna do?
Just get in the truck!
 Country music plays[ Siren wails ]
Oh, great.
[ Music stops ]
Maybe he's seen Lance.
Lance is dead, baby.
What?!
Everyone shut up!
All right?
I'll handle this.
[ Sighs ]
Good afternoon, officer.
[ Light laughter ]
Shipley: You know,
I heard a bunch of shots
go off a minute ago.
Sounded like
bagh-fucking-dad.
We ain't done nothin.
Sir, we --
sorry about that.
We -we just wanted to
make sure that, uh,
th-that we got him.
[ Laughs ]
Yeah, I love
this huntin' thing!
Well, you know,
you only got to put one in 'em,
as long as you
put it in the right spot.
[ Laughter ]
Whew!
Did you tag 'im?
Tag 'im?
Did you tag 'im?
Did you put a damn tag
in your deer's ear
to make it legal,
dipshit?
Oh! Oh, oh, d-did we --
did we tag him
t-to make it legal?
[ Laughs ]
Oh, yeah.
No, no, sure, yeah.
No, we tagged him.
Yeah! Yeah! Tagged him twice
just to be sure.
Tagged it.
We ain't done nothin'.
Kindly step from
your vehicle, gentlemen.
Boys,
we got
a little sayin' out here
goes a little somethin'
like this.
If somethin' stinks,
chances are you're probably
standin' in shit.
And guess what I smell,
boys?
Shit?
Circle gets
the fucking square.
I smell shit.
Well, that's probably 'cause
you're standing in it.
[ Laughs ]
[ Cows mooing ]
[ Flies buzzing ]
Damn it!
Oh, you think
this is funny, huh?
Well, let me see your load!
Wait. Load?
Your damn deer!
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Don't you need, like,
a warrant or something?
Yeah! Yeah!
A search warrant!
I'm not checking for
a bag of marijuana here.
I'm checking your load.
Now step aside, son.
O-okay, okay.
Uh, but th-there's
something you should know.
Playtime's over, dipshit.
Let's see what you got
under the tarp.
[ Groans ]
We ain't done nothin'.
[ Injector hisses ]
What the hell
are you doing?!
Our goose was cooked, boss.
I had no other choice.
You killed him?!
He killed him, Craig!
Easy, twinkle toes. He's just
gonna take a little siesta.
What happens
when he wakes up, Jerry, huh?
Have you thought of that?
Did you fucking think of that?!
We'll be long gone by then,
or dead.
Just help me with his feet.
Come on, we got to get
him back in his truck.
Do it yourself.
[ Grunts ]
[ Ominous music plays ]
Where's the body?
I told you.
You got to destroy the brain.
[ Ringing ]
Lance:
Hey there, heartbreaker.
I can't
come to the phone right now.
I'm on
some bullshit camping trip.
But go ahead
and leave a message
and I just might
get back to you.
[ Beep]
Lance, where the hell
are you, man, huh?
I need you to come back to
the lodge, okay? Like, asap!
We're in a lot of trouble.
I'll explain later --
at least, I think I can.
It's kind of weird.
I need you to come back
to the lodge, all right?
And also...
[ Sighs ]
...I need to
ask you something.
Okay, it's something I heard.
I don't even think
you'd do something like this.
I don't even know
how to ask, but, uh...
Are you --
are you sleeping with Carla?
Female voice:
To erase and re-record,press "3."Shit.
To continue recordingwhere you left off, press "4."[ Beep ]
At the tone, please --[ beep ]
[ Sighs ]
Lance, uh, it's Craig.
Come back to the lodge asap.
Thank you.
[ Beep ]
Are you sure
you don't want to go with us?
And become an accessory
to any more murders?
No. I think
I'm fine on my own. Thanks.
All right, just meet us
back here in an hour.
And call us
if you find him.
Thanks again
for the awesome weekend, Craig.
Top 10 for sure.
Damn it!
[ Coyote howls ]
Whatcha see, boss?
Come on.
[ Engine shuts off ]
All right, wait here.
[ Gun cocks ]
And put that away!
Are you sure, boss?
Yes.
[ Wind howling ]
[ Clatter ]
Hello?
Lance?
Are you here, buddy?
[ Clatter ]
[ Clatter ]
Lance?
[ Clatter ]
Hey!
Aah! Holy shit!
Sorry, boss.
I thought I told you
to wait in the truck.
I couldn't let you
go in alone.
I found
Lance's jacket outside.
Do you have a light?
Where did you get --
never mind.
Hey...
I think
we found your friend.
Lance,
is that you, buddy?
[ Growls ]
What's wrong with him?
It kind of looks like
the guy you shot, huh, boss?
Wait. What do you --
what do you mean the guy I shot?
The old-timer -Clyde.
No, I know what you're
talking about, all right,
 accidentallyshot him, okay?
You're the one that
turned him into Swiss cheese!
I had to.
He was a zombie.
And he'd be dead right
now if you let me put
one into his head.
Isn't any of this starting to
click with you, boss?
I mean, look at him.
That's no good.
[ Both screaming ]
Aah!
[ Growls ]
Still convinced
he ain't a zombie, boss?
Th-that's just stupid,
all right?! I mean,
h-he's just sick.
You know the bug
that's going around.
Clyde! Clyde probably
gave it to him.
Bug?
Oh, yeah, yeah, these are
definitely flu-like symptoms.
Look at him!
[ Growling ]
You want me to
prove it to you?
No! No!
All right, then what do you
want to do with him, huh?
Take him to dinner?
Look at him!
We're gonna take him into town
to a hospital.
Oh, yeah,
that's a good idea.
We'll take the zombie
to the hospital,
and then he'll be back
boning your girlfriend
in no time!
Be sure to tag 'im.
God, I really hate you.
Did you remember to
read him a bedtime story?
Don't you dare
shoot him, Jerry.
I'll do what needs doin'
when the time comes.
That's the difference
between the two of us.
Man: I can't believe
what you did last night.
I wouldn't tell anybody
if it was me.
[ Laughter ]
Man #2: Okay, guys.
You all be quiet.
You need to keep
those cucumbers to yourself.
Cucumbers.
[ Laughs ]
You have to learn
how to put this stuff on.
Clyde?
Is that you?
[ Growls ]
Hey, Clyde.
Seen any chupacabras lately?
[ Laughter ]
[ Growls ]
[ Screaming ]
[ Door creaks ]
Tom?
Tom, are you here?
We found Lance!
All right,
where do you want him?
Bathroom.
Ah, shit.
All right.
Christ on a bike.
All right. Okay.
[ Scoffs ]
[ Bag unzips ]
[ Sniffs ]
What?
This is pathetic.
What, Jerry? Huh?
That I help my friends out?
Look, I don't know how they
do it on the east coast, okay,
but down here we don't
shoot our friends when
they get inconvenient.
This isn't "the godfather!"
Hey!
You're goddamn right
this ain't
'cause Michael corleone
would do what he had to
do, all right?
He killed his own brother
for the good of the family,
for God's sake!
Oh, yeah, and he
was wracked with guilt
for the third film, all right,
and never the same!
It was a despicable thing
to do!
Enough!
I will not have you
talking about Michael this way
and the difficult decisions
that he had to make, all right?
He was a man!
A man!
He was a character
in a fucking movie!
It's not just a fucking
movie! It's a goddamn
epic trilogy!
Yes, with one of the worst
endings in cinema history,
all right?
[ Laughs ]
Andy Garcia?
Are you fucking kidding me?!
Take it back!
Never!
Take it back!
Aah!
Aah!
[ Both grunting ]
Ha ha!
Take it back!
Yeah! Take it back!
Never! Never!
Take it back!
No! Never!
[ Cellphone ringing ]
Get off me!
Get off me!
It could be tom.
It could be tom.
[ Both panting ]
To-aah!
It's tom.
Tom?
Tom, we found Lance!
We --
where are you?
Tom:
[ Speaking indistinctly ]
Tom?
T-tom,
I can't hear you.
Help!
[ Pulsating tone ]
Tom? To--
shit!
[ Door opens ]
Where are you going?
To find your faggoty friend.
He may still be alive.
If I were you, I'd shoot
the zombie in the bathroom.
Michael corleone
would've done it in the barn.
[ Door closes ]
[ Country music plays ]
[ Vehicle approaches ]
Damn it.
Hold on a minute.
On hold, lemon pie.
Holy hell.
Can I get you anything else,

Now,
let's try this again.
What were you doing
on my property?
I told you, I didn't know
I was on your property.
Everything out here
looks the same!
Aah!
Do I look like a fool
to you?
No!
He's lyin',
Billy ray.
Really, murph?
H-he's lying?
He just said
he didn't think I was a fool.
I'll let you think
on that one.
Look!
I'm sorry for trespassing.
I promise, I had no idea!
Please, just let me go.
Or at least let me
put some pants on.
The floor is cold.
I'm afraid
it's just not that easy.
You see, I'm what
the locals around here
refer to as a badass.
Now, if I just
allowed you to leave
without
suffering the consequences,
well, that might
soil a reputation
I've worked so tirelessly
to maintain.
You understand?
So, that's a no
to the pants then?
Hm.
Hey! Let's give 'em
a spankin'!
What?! No!

I will be participating in
the barbaric ritual
of hunting this weekend,

someone will
get back to you shortly.
Oh, God.

Tom! It's Craig, all right?
Where the hell are you?
Okay, we found Lance.
All right, he's sick --
okay, very sick.
[ Sighs ] Look,
Jerry's out looking for you.
I'm don't know
if that's such a good idea.
I just -I need you to give me
a call back asap, all right?
And change your voicemail.
"Someone will be
getting back to you?"
I mean, that just sounds gay.
I mean, it's stupid.
[ Sighs ] To hell with it.
It's gay, okay?
And that's okay because
if you're gay, then I'm cool,
so just come out with it,
you know?
I mean, t-that is

No, Jerry!

of my gentlemen's club?!
I am a badass!
Oh, from where I'm sitting,
it looks like
you just want
some ass...Bad.
How dare you
speak so to me?!
You will learn humility.
You're never gonna
get away with this, boss.
Sheriff o'Connor,
how are you this evening?
 GunshotSo you see, we've already
gotten away with it.
And as long as that bloody
game warden keeps his distance,
we will continue
getting away with it.

I really wonder where he
is right now. You know, it's

Hey, uh, I think there's
some trash bags in the back seat

get a little chilly.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, and don't worry.
I, uh, I won't tell anybody
about the ass raping.
Ass raping?
[ Laughs ]
There wasn't
any fucking ass raping!
I was ridden around like a pony
and spanked.
That's it!
Yeah.
Whatever you say, boss.

Aah!
Oh. [ Laughs ]
Whoo!
Oh. Whoa.

are you guys?
Carla: Craig?
Carla!
What's going on?
Hey, well, uh, yeah,
th-th-that's
kind of a tough one.
Say, how are things
where you are?
What do you mean?
I mean, uh,
are people trying to
bite each other?
Bite each other?
Attacking --
trying to
maim or kill really.
What are you talking about,
Craig?
Never mind.
...no fucking panthers.[ Laughs ]
You're at
another party again, huh?
Do not start with me.
Yes, I'm at another party.
Look, your text message
said you had to talk about
something important.
Was that biting thing it?
Oh, no.
Look, I need to
ask you something, all right?
It's something
that I heard about you...
Lance: [ Laughs ]
...and Lance.
Uh, look, Craig,
I-I-I can't really hear you.
I can't talk right
now. We're gonna talk
later, okay? Bye.
[ Beep ]
Are you
sleeping with Lance?
[ Laughs ]
[ TV chatter ]
Fuck that!It was him!I came here to hunt!Lance?
Are you
sleeping with Carla?
I know. I know.
Crazy, right?
It's just that tom said
he saw you with Carla,
and the way you acted
when I showed you the ring...
I don't know.
I just get the feeling
that Carla's not happy.
Maybe I'm just insecure.
Lie back, Craig.
What?
On the couch.
Get comfortable.
You said something intriguing
just now, Craig.
I did?
Yes, Craig, you did.
You said
you were feeling insecure.
Well, yeah.
I mean, I guess so.
[ Sighs ] I just get the feeling
I'm not good enough.
Were you breast-fed, Craig?
What?
Did your mother
breast-feed you?
Lance,
you're acting weird.
[ Guttural voice ]
Just answer the question!
No.
Well,
studies have shown that
when a child, specifically
a male, is not breast-fed,
they oftentimes
lose their sense of security,
which usually
translates into
a dissociation
with the opposite sex.
Insecurity, Craig.
All right, Lance,
you're acting weird.
Craig, it's my belief that
Carla's not the issue,
or some nasty rumor.
It's your mother, Craig.
My mother?
[ Guttural voice ]
Yes, Craig! Your mother!
I'm not so sure about --
[ Normal voice ]
Think about it.
Carla loves you.
She'd never betray your trust.
It's been five years.
Six years.
[ Guttural voice ]
Six years.
[ Normal voice ]
Now, these feelings,
these insecurities
you're experiencing
are a direct result of the
essential motherly attention
that you were deprived of
as an infant.
Maybe you're right.
My mother never cut
off the crust off on my
peanut butter sandwiches,
and she knew
I liked them that way.
Bingo.
Thanks for talking,
Lance.
Any time, buddy boy.
[ Bell rings ]
You're seriously
gonna do this right now?
Hey, when nature calls,
I say hello.
Just hold it!
Eh, ain't good
to keep it inside.
[ Sighs ] Shit.
[ Gun cocks ]
Back in a jiff.
I'm wearing a trash bag,
for Christ's sake.
You look good in black.
Oh. Well, thank you.
Idiot.

Ah!
[ Humming ]
Ow!
Yes!
What the hell?!
Oh!
You're not a zombie?
What are you
talkin' about, boy?
I'm so sorry, it was just
weird the way you were
standing there
just staring at me like that.
You're wearin' a garbage-bag
dress and I'm the weirdo?
Way to stereotype,
a-hole.
What? No.
And it's not a dress --
more like a robe or a wrap.
[ Growls ]
Anyway, I didn't
mean it that way.

You sure did.
With a crucifix no less.
That's kind of poetic.
Congrats.
Hey, you all right,
boss?
He didn't try to rape you
or anything, did he?
No, Jerry.
All right, it's just...
Well,
you're naked again,
and being a priest and all,
I thought maybe --
thank you
for pointing that out, Jerry.
No problem, boss.
Ahh.
[ Slaps back ]
Good work.

I didn't mean to do it.

Great trip, Craig.
I killed him.
I killed my best friend.
Not yet.
You got to destroy the brain.
Here, take my shotgun.
No!
Get that away from me!
It was an accident.
Well,
look at it this way.
At least you got your
girlfriend's vagina back, huh?
He didn't do that!
He told me so!
You will be missed,

Hello?

Uh-huh.
Hey, so, I got a really weird
call from Craig earlier.
I think he might be
on to us. Has he said
anything to you?
No.
Good.
Oh, maybe I'm just
being a little paranoid.
He's such a weirdo.
Anyway, I can't wait
for you to come back.

go a little buck wild.

out of here.
That's a good idea,

they could drive.

[ Gun cocks ]
Get to the truck.
[ Engine sputters ]
What the hell?!
What is it?
We're out of gas.
We just had a full tank
this morning.
We were just at
a gas station, Jerry.
You didn't think to
fill up?
You were
at a gas station?
I forgot to
look at the gas gauge.
I'm -I'm sorry, boss.
[ As Jerry ]
I'm sorry, boss!
I'm sorry, boss!
[ Normal voice ]
How can you not look
at the gas gauge?!
It's right beside
the speedometer!
'Cause I never
look at the speedometer.
I'm gonna kill you!
All right! All right!
Tom! Tom!
Hey, look! Stop!
Stop! Just stop!
We're just gonna have to
make a stand
here at the ranch house.
Remember the alamo?
Everyone was slaughtered
at the alamo, Craig.
That's not the point, tom,
all right?
This is where we fight.
This is where they die!
Huh?!
"300"? The movie?
[ Growling ]
[ Glass shatters ]
Nice turtleneck, tom.
Fuck off, Craig.
What if we just
hold out until morning?
They can't be
exposed to sunlight, right?
Jerry: Those aren't
vampires, tom.
They're gonna be out there
until we put a bullet
into every one
of their pretty little heads.
Well, we're screwed.
How much ammo
do we have, Jerry?
Ammo?
Oh, I got your ammo.
Gentlemen,
choose your weapons.
Wow. There are
all sorts of felonies in there.
Good work, Jerry.
[ Glass shatters ]
This place
isn't gonna hold much longer.
I know. I wish we could
get that damn truck to start.
I'm sorry about that,
boss.
W-wait. Wait a sec.
Aren't there a couple of
gas cans out back for the 4x4?
Remember? Clyde said
"one, two, count 'em."
Hey! That's right!
There are!
If we could
get that gas into Craig's truck,
we could
get the hell out of here!
That's beautiful, baby.
That's fucking beautiful!
I love you, tom!
I fucking love you!
Okay, calm down.
All right,
it's gonna be tough.
They're everywhere.
But if it's the only way...
...it's time to
get buck wild.
Buck wild, baby.
Buck wild.
All: Buck wild!
Jerry:

Oh, God of war,
we pray to you in this,
our darkest hour.

we will leave here as men.
[ Inhales deeply ]
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done...
All:
On earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day
our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those
who trespassed against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom,
the power,
and the glory forever and ever.
Amen.
L'Chaim.
Play ball.
So, who's
going out there?
I'll go.
No, no, no.
I'll go.
The gas thing
was my fault.
Don't you want a gun?
Nah. I got to improve
my blade skills.
Besides,
swords don't run out of bullets.

They're coming in!
Stay here.
Use the shotgun.
Let Jerry back in,
but keep them out.
We need that gas.
Uh, really quickly...
[ Voice cracking ]
How many bullets do I have
and where is the safety
on this thing?
I know
you can do this, tom.
Hold them off.
Shit balls.
[ Zombies growling ]
Aah!
[ Whimpers ]
Come on! Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on!
Yes!
Shit!
Yes!
Yeah, baby!
[ Growls ]
Oh, shit.
[ Screaming ]
[ Glass shatters ]
Tom: [ Screaming ]
[ Door handle jiggling ]
Come on,
open the door!
Ride me!
Ride me like a pony!
You --
[ screaming ]
I'm coming for you,
boss!
Aah!
[ Panting ]
Is that a fish?
Yeah.
[ Thud ]
I found it
in the freezer.
Well, you're definitely
getting the award
for best kill
and most improved.
[ Laughs ]
Thanks, Jerry.
Craig: Aah!
Craig!
Aah! What took you guys
so long?
Tom had to play
a little game of "go fish."
What?
Never mind. Bad joke.
We got the gas.
Only one tank though --
I got blind-sided.
That should be
good enough.
We got to
make a break for the truck.
I got this.
Tom! Tom,
help me with the door!
[ Screaming ]
This is it!
Aah!
This is it, Craig!
I got you!
I got you, buddy!
Jerry!
[ Both scream ]
Shoot!
What the hell, man?!
[ Zombie groans ]
I'm sorry, boss!
My aim is all off tonight.
I can usually make those.
Can you ever forgive me?
That's perfectly all right,
Jerry.
I accepted that you were
probably gonna kill me.
Great trip, Craig.
Top 10...For sure.
Is he dead?!
Nah.
Nah,
it's just a flesh wound.
Probably just
passed out.
[ Glass shatters ]
[ Zombie growls ]
[ Screaming ]
Tom!
Aah!
[ Fabric rips ]
My turtleneck!
No!
Now he's dead.
[ Crash ]
[ Gunfire ]
Only the dead have seen
the end of war, boss.
That's Plato.
Thanks, Jerry.
I spilled
most of the gas, boss!
That's all right.
I guess this is it!
Goodbye, buddy!
See you on the other side,
brother!
[ Gunfire stops ]
[ Shells clatter ]
Shipley:
All right, assholes!Come out with your hands up.It's time to pay the Piper.
That's our ride!
Let's get out of here!
Get your asses
out here now!
[ Zombies growling ]
What the hell?
[ Gun cocks ]
Shit.
This is for tom.
Shots fired! We got shots fired
at buck wild ranch!
Damn it, Shirley!
Come on in!
Craig! Duck!
Yeah!
Suck on that,
you British hillbilly banana!
[ Laughs ]
Eh? Eh?
You thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?
Yahtzee.
This is it!
[ Radio chatter ]
[ Screaming ]
What in the holy hell
is going on here?
You two fags get out of
the truck right now!
You're under arrest!
We didn't do nothin'!
Please, sir,
we'll explain later.
We got to go now!
I'm calling the shots!
I'm calling the shots!
We didn't do nothin'!
Please, sir,
we got to go now!
Get out!
Aah!
Shit!
He's got the keys!
What?!
Shit.
[ Screaming ]
We're not gettin' them back,
neither.
You know how to do that?
I'm from New York.
[ Laughs ]
Don't leave me.
I'm sorry.
[ Engine turns over ]
Ah! [ Laughs ]
Here we go!
Whoo!
[ Sighs ]
[ Ring clinks ]
[ Sighs ]
Hey, man, I, uh --
I want to apologize for
telling you that I hated you
yesterday.
Ah. Water under
the bridge, boss.
Thanks again
for inviting me along.
Top-10 trip.
And, uh, for the record,
I do like
"the godfather" trilogy.
Thanks a lot, man.
That really
means a lot, man.
[ Bang ]
[ Tires screech ]
What the hell was that?
[ Ominous music plays ]
[ Car doors close ]
Craig: It's a buck.
It's a good,
clean kill, too.
Sure would be a shame
to waste him.
Make sure you tag 'im.
[ Both laugh ]
Hey, Jerry?
Yeah, boss?
W-w-what did --
what did you do anyway in --
in New York?
Uh, just had a handful
of unpaid parking tickets.
[ Laughs ]
[ Laughs ] Yeah.
And I might've
killed this guy, too, though.
But it was an accident.
It was a misunderstanding,
really.
[ Laughs ]
I'm just messin' with you,
boss!
[ Both laughing ]
