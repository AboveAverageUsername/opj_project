What women need
is the same as what men need,
and that's the Marxist conception
in their consciousness.
Which would,
if accepted by both men and women,
destroy all anomalies in human society
that inhibit the progress and
the unity of the people,
good life, happiness, and idyll.
I've had some bad luck with women.
In the past fifteen years,
I have encountered around
twelve to thirteen thousand free girls,
namely divorcees and widows.
They've all turned me down,
telling me: "back off, you piece of shit,
you swine, you bastard..."
That's incredible!
If they all spat on me at the same time,
these twelve to thirteen thousand,
I would be covered in saliva as high as
Chicago's tallest skyscraper.
To build socialism, one needs socialists.
And to get socialists...
it is essential...
that I get permission...
from parliament...
by a parliamentary decision...
for one thousand girls, 20 to
25 years old, in Hotel Yugoslavia.
Which means five thousand socialists
in five years.
Because there's no socialism
without socialists.
As soon as they are born...
Namely, as soon as they're five years old,
The CapitalThis would achieve socialism...
and stabilise society.
Hotel Yugoslavia has to be promptly
turned into a Marxist institute.
The first in the world
for creating socialists.
I think if I found myself on some
other planet, outside of this one,
and had such a number
of socialists with me,
I would send an ultimatum from space
that everyone must subjugate
to socialism and Marxism
or be destroyed.
I, Cebic Stanoje,
Marxist fanatic,
metalworker of the European class,
posses this item on my head:
A beret of the proletarians from Broadway.
On my back, an English-licenced blazer.
A German-licenced sweater.
A Yugoslavian shirt.
A Yugoslavian undershirt.
Belgian-licenced trousers.
Yugoslavian underpants.
Yugoslavian socks.
artilleryThis is "alles kapital" for socialism!
Dammit...
I would paint all of this red...
and walls, and houses,
and roofs, and trees,
and lampposts, and factories,
and people, and suits, and horses, and...
roads!
I would paint it all red!
Even women's...
eyelashes.
With the colour red, not...
the colour of rot,
as they're colouring themselves today.
And we, the men, are disgusted by it.
So foreigners could see that they've
come to a red, workers' state.
Long live the greatest giants of work,
of European and world roads,
namely truck drivers,
the greatest humanists.
Three times "Thank You!"
Merci beaucoup, Danke schön, grazie,

Merci beaucoup, hvala!Bitte schön, Herr, ich Yugoslave,

KOLT 15 GAP
Keine Arbeit, keine Geld.I'm a metalworker of the European class,
a Marxist, Lenin's emissary,
who besides searching for a job...
is also on a Marxist mission
in every factory I pass through.
For the past twenty years, or namely,
for the past twenty-five years,
it hasn't hurt
to have had someone like me around,
someone who's going against system.
And I'm confronting the state
only because...
after seeing 150 factories
throughout Yugoslavia,
I've concluded that those working
the hardest get the lowest pay.
When I see all that,
I can't and I won't...
and don't have any reason,
on principle,
to work.
Not even in my dreams!
I was taught in Second Military School
not to work for exploiters.
No matter where they come from.
So...
as a Marxist...
who fights exploiters...
how could I work for
and aid the exploiters?
Do you remember, Pa, when we were
sleeping here from 1941 to 1945?
Of course...
Here were the cows,
and we slept over there.
That means...
we were sharing fifty-fifty,
we and the cows.
Do you remember how I left
this stable in 1946,
to learn a craft?
Do you remember how I got approval
from the Ministry of Defence?
To go to a military-industrial school?
Yes...
Yes...
Do you know...
Do you remember when you crushed
my head against that wall,
because I went to the partisans?
You must remember!
He wasn't even fifteen years old yet.
And I already had one son who
had joined the partisans.
That's why...
I had to...
Everyone was naked, barefoot...
I was searching...
To earn some money...
But you see...
He also never made any money...
What now...?
I came from a village,
probably looking like a bum
who barely knew how to write.
Here I received my first baptisms.
My first introduction to civilisation.
Here they poured
so much into my head...
Almost like with a funnel.
So, I retained everything
and it remained in my head.
Stuck as a fly to a glue trap.
Marxism, socialism...
Theoretically...
And it seems to me
they put in my head...
the entire communist society.
While learning my craft,
I was being poisoned
for three years.
Poured, poured into my head...
Then another three years,
in the Yugoslav People's Army.
Then, for two years, I was pouring it
into the head of another man.
Then, I was chief of a communist youth
organization, for a year...
This is how one ends up
who doesn't have Marxism on his mind!
Here I was, correctly explicating
the party line of Marxism
and government.
Although I was a good worker,
a good repairman,
I realised that it wasn't worth it.
I realised what it's all about and what
they want to do with an honest man.
Just when I think about them...
Almost every day, I think about
suing the state for discrimination,
for discrepancy between education
and later practice in production.
Marxism is... Leninism
of the period of imperialism
and workers' revolution.
The workers' class...
of the world,
together with Marx, has expelled God
from human society
and in that way has become
the gravedigger of capitalism.
Which means that Marxism is
the fucker of capitalism!
I'm a Marxist fanatic.
Which means...
I'm excessively interested in it.
But... I don't want...
Namely, I don't regret...
being this way
because it's my pride and glory
and I would give my life for it!
I'm a blind practitioner of Marxism
and this is my honour
as a Yugoslav metalworker!
Unemployed for four years,
I spend my time here
at the railway and bus station.
I get warmed up...
And I follow... the motion.
If someone's hand creeps
into someone else's pocket...
I stop him, I catch him, et cetera.
Because...
I've been to 150 factories,
where I've seen people work hard
to make a living.
And they need to be
protected by someone.
So I...
found myself doing this
following the appeal
of the Federal Secretary
in 1967.
I joined the fight
against societal evil,
did my civic duty
in accordance with the law,
and plus...
spontaneously helped the government.
But...
I get a lot of interference in all this
from the police!
Now I'm doing "KOLT 15 GAP",
which stands for:
"Collect waste, lick dishes,
15 years, actively or passively."
It means exactly that
in five different languages.
I do this because I've been without a job
for 4 and a half years, namely 5 years.
Tried to work as a carrier,
they wouldn't let me.
I cannot work in a coal mine.
And I cannot become a criminal
because I have on my mind:
Marx, Engels, Lenin,
Tito and Che Guevara.
For 20 years, 95 percent of the time
I didn't have anywhere to sleep.
Working or not working,
it was always the same.
During my trial work in 180 factories,
in Yugoslavia and nine other countries,
I had to sleep
at railway stations, in waggons, parks,
on benches, or in the best case
in worker's barracks, elevators, on
doormats, in phone booths,
basements and public toilets.
I propose to the state
and the state organs
to erase me from the registration list
for ID card and place of residence,
and everything else that my
consciousness has overcome.
I'm ashamed when I hear
about official documents.
I can live without state, police,
courts, jails, and army.
To me, all of that is dead...
If I were president,
I would abolish parliament,
I would abolish the federation
and the republic,
I would leave the state
on a municipal level,
I would build gallows
in the periphery of every town...
Every town would have gallows...
and if someone steals, he'll be hanged.
I would also build
a public speaking platform,
so 20 million Yugoslavs could
say what they think.
Certainly...
20 million know better
than 200 politicians,
and we wouldn't need
stabilisation of society.
I would leave the police
on a municipal level,
cut the army in half,
and from their budgets,
all municipalities
would send some percentage
to army headquarters...
that would continue
to function and to protect
the state from
foreigners...
Doing all that,
abolishing the federation
and the republic,
means I would abolish myself in the end.
I'm Cebic.

for a long time?
Ten years.

I'm a worker too...
It's a low salary!
I'm a worker too, unemployed...

Do you know who he is?
I wouldn't know...
No...
Okay, cheers!
I'm from a village. I wouldn't know...

and I get bonuses.
How much, for example,
with bonuses?
About 90 thousand, 100...
Okay, fine. Cheers!
Could you answer some questions?
I'm a metalworker too but unemployed.
Him, him, him!
Ask him!
Brother, I'm a metalworker,
maybe you are too?
Can you tell me...
Are you satisfied with your salary?
So-so...
What? So, so.
It means: not really...
And have you heard of Marx?
Yes.
Who was he?
Go, Macedonian, go!
Go to hell!
Hm...
You mean... I mean in a few sentences.
Who was he?
He was a famous Russian...
Who was...
We also act by him...
A-ha...

of the working class?
Of the working class of all the nations.
Yes, of the world's working class.
Have you heard of Marx?
What?
Have you heard of Marx?
But of course. In school.

How to say it...
He was a man who...

of a socialist concept.

Are you satisfied with that?
No.
What are you doing here?
What do you want here?
Are you crazy?
You cannot film here!
You need a permit!
A thousand times in this odyssey
of a life of mine, I thought
about grabbing a submachine gun
and climbing up a pole at Terazije...
That is to say if I was ready to die...
And then I would say everything
that has been in my heart for 20 years...
in my honest, noble and humane life,
because as a Marxist,
I'm a humanist above all...
Six years ago, I was in Valjevo,
at the social welfare office,
asking for minimal help,
as an unemployed person,
and they knew me as a longtime worker
who travels and often changes jobs,
and only demands what he is entitled to.
So they decided to bring in a psychiatrist.
They probably assumed I was smart.
The psychiatrist performed a detailed
examination and said to the official...
that I was smarter than the official, the
psychiatrist, and the one who'd sent me.
He said: "Tell the one who sent you
to go fuck himself!"
"Because..."
"Say..."
"that the smart one told the smart ones
that the smart one is smart."
So I left the examination,
and I left Valjevo,
and stayed in Belgrade as a smart one,
to continue my search for a job...
