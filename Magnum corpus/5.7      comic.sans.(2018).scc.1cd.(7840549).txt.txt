00: 00: 34,680 -> 00: 00: 36,680
Hello.
Hello.
00: 00: 42,760 -> 00: 00: 45,320
Two more, if you love.
00: 00: 45,400 -> 00: 00: 47,480
Thanks.
00: 00: 50,760 -> 00: 00: 53,320
What?
00: 00: 53,400 -> 00: 00: 56,880
Nothing.
It's strange to see you.
00: 00: 58,640 -> 00: 01: 02,920
 Another man unravels her hair,

00: 01: 06,360 -> 00: 01: 09,360
Please do not.
Why?
00: 01: 10,920 -> 00: 01: 12,600
Say what's new?
00: 01: 12,680 -> 00: 01: 16,200
I read your new show
has gone great.
00: 01: 16,280 -> 00: 01: 20,680
Yes, it is true. In Lisbon
I showed the poster for which he posed.
00: 01: 20,760 -> 00: 01: 23,520
I know, I understand. Congratulations!
00: 01: 27,040 -> 00: 01: 32,360
Besides ... Lucas took a prize
for cat food.
00: 01: 32,440 -> 00: 01: 35,960
"Mustaches," with ears.
I remembered.
00: 01: 36,040 -> 00: 01: 38,640
The other day we were
of the presentation in Ljubljana.
00: 01: 38,720 -> 00: 01: 40,720
You are still mired at work.
00: 01: 43,680 -> 00: 01: 45,320
Are you annoying?
00: 01: 45,400 -> 00: 01: 49,400
No, but do not, please.
"Apparently, you are not uncomfortable.
00: 01: 49,480 -> 00: 01: 52,800
Why did not he call once,
ever since I left you?
00: 01: 56,680 -> 00: 01: 58,680
I was affected.
00: 02: 00,040 -> 00: 02: 03,000
He dropped me at the busiest moment,
I worked like a madman.
00: 02: 03,080 -> 00: 02: 05,520
He is always "the busiest" for you.
00: 02: 05,600 -> 00: 02: 07,600
Whatever.
00: 02: 08,600 -> 00: 02: 10,400
You did not want, you did not call.
00: 02: 10,480 -> 00: 02: 13,000
Apologize,
that I'm overloaded?
00: 02: 13,080 -> 00: 02: 14,480
Of course not.
00: 02: 14,560 -> 00: 02: 19,360
You need a wretch,
to devote you fully,
00: 02: 19,440 -> 00: 02: 22,080
to do whatever you want,
00: 02: 22,160 -> 00: 02: 25,440
not to think with who you are,
when you travel ...
00: 02: 25,520 -> 00: 02: 27,840
Are you still releasing the same record?
00: 02: 27,920 -> 00: 02: 29,920
No, no.
00: 02: 41,120 -> 00: 02: 44,920
So he left me because I am
and women like me.
00: 02: 45,000 -> 00: 02: 46,560
You want me a whisper?
00: 02: 46,640 -> 00: 02: 49,160
Enjoy bachelor life.
00: 02: 49,240 -> 00: 02: 53,120
You can do whatever you want.
Your father will be proud of you.
00: 02: 54,120 -> 00: 02: 58,080
What does my father have in common?
You are the same. You both are ...
00: 03: 02,200 -> 00: 03: 04,360
Do not, do not kiss me!
00: 03: 08,440 -> 00: 03: 10,600
Honey ...
00: 03: 10,680 -> 00: 03: 12,680
Excuse me I did not call you.
00: 03: 14,040 -> 00: 03: 17,400
I know the job is
the dumbest excuse.
00: 03: 17,480 -> 00: 03: 19,480
Listen.
00: 03: 22,240 -> 00: 03: 24,280
I love you.
00: 03: 24,360 -> 00: 03: 26,360
Really.
00: 03: 27,200 -> 00: 03: 30,840
I was an idiot, I could not say it,
and now...
00: 03: 30,920 -> 00: 03: 34,280
And until tomorrow I tell you,
that I love you and I miss you,
00: 03: 34,360 -> 00: 03: 36,760
I do not know how to prove you.
00: 03: 40,920 -> 00: 03: 43,600
I rushed.
00: 03: 43,680 -> 00: 03: 45,080
I can not sleep.
00: 03: 45,160 -> 00: 03: 47,840
I get drunk every night.
00: 03: 47,920 -> 00: 03: 50,080
I get drugs, I do not eat.
00: 03: 58,720 -> 00: 04: 00,680
Without you I am nothing.
00: 04: 02,040 -> 00: 04: 05,600
It is too late.
Not true!
00: 04: 05,680 -> 00: 04: 06,920
It's not late.
00: 04: 07,000 -> 00: 04: 09,280
You never told me you loved me.
00: 04: 29,520 -> 00: 04: 31,000
I missed you so much.
00: 04: 31,080 -> 00: 04: 33,080
And you of me.
00: 04: 51,000 -> 00: 04: 56,200
ERROR SCRIPT
00: 04: 59,400 -> 00: 05: 02,480
Be blessed, O God,
Almighty Father,
00: 05: 02,600 -> 00: 05: 06,640
You who sent us His son,
to save us.
00: 05: 06,720 -> 00: 05: 08,720
Be blessed, God.
00: 05: 08,800 -> 00: 05: 13,400
Blessed be You, One Sons,
You who descended among men,
00: 05: 13,480 -> 00: 05: 15,440
to treat our disabilities.
00: 05: 15,520 -> 00: 05: 17,200
Be blessed, God.
00: 05: 17,280 -> 00: 05: 19,520
Blessed be, Holy Spirit,
Comforter,
00: 05: 19,600 -> 00: 05: 23,720
You who continually support us
in our weakness.
00: 05: 23,800 -> 00: 05: 29,120
Your obedient Rabbi,
our sister will be anointed.
00: 05: 29,200 -> 00: 05: 33,600
Be relieved of her pain,
strength in its weakness.
00: 05: 33,680 -> 00: 05: 36,560
In the name of Father and Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
00: 05: 37,800 -> 00: 05: 41,880
Let him with his unceasing mercy
00: 05: 41,960 -> 00: 05: 45,080
May the Lord help you with mercy
of the Holy Spirit.
00: 05: 46,160 -> 00: 05: 50,800
Deliver you from sin
and look merciful to you.
00: 05: 50,880 -> 00: 05: 52,880
Amen.
00: 08: 36,480 -> 00: 08: 38,960
Hello.
 Hello, son. 00: 08: 39,040 -> 00: 08: 41,360
Excuse me, I did not call.
00: 08: 41,440 -> 00: 08: 44,040
 There is nothing. Did I wake you up? 00: 08: 44,120 -> 00: 08: 46,440
No, I'm already drinking coffee. Say?
00: 08: 46,520 -> 00: 08: 48,920
 Getting ready, I'm going to Vis. 00: 08: 49,000 -> 00: 08: 51,160
Do you find the gallery?
00: 08: 51,240 -> 00: 08: 55,440
 It was not the plan, but it is necessary

00: 08: 55,520 -> 00: 08: 57,680
 Aunt Mattha died.  00: 08: 57,760 -> 00: 09: 01,760
Which?
 Aunt Matia, do not you remember her? 00: 09: 01,840 -> 00: 09: 04,600
Yes, I can not think of anything.
 00: 09: 04,680 -> 00: 09: 07,800
 Being small,

00: 09: 07,880 -> 00: 09: 09,680
 The house with herbs. 00: 09: 09,760 -> 00: 09: 13,240
 Anyway.

00: 09: 13,320 -> 00: 09: 15,320
 And everything around the will. 00: 09: 15,400 -> 00: 09: 17,960
Are you expecting something?
00: 09: 18,040 -> 00: 09: 20,440
 I do not know. 00: 09: 20,520 -> 00: 09: 22,480
Did she have children, heirs?
00: 09: 22,560 -> 00: 09: 24,840
 No. It was quite special. 00: 09: 24,920 -> 00: 09: 29,840
 That's why I'm calling you.

00: 09: 29,920 -> 00: 09: 31,360
 At least for the will.  00: 09: 31,440 -> 00: 09: 35,760
I can not, I have no time.
I'm working on a project, I'm going to Ljubljana.
00: 09: 35,840 -> 00: 09: 38,000
I'll see, I'll call you.
00: 09: 38,880 -> 00: 09: 40,680
 Okay, son, come on. 00: 09: 40,760 -> 00: 09: 42,760
Bye.
00: 10: 03,040 -> 00: 10: 05,440
 I love you. 00: 10: 23,120 -> 00: 10: 25,160
Do you want more schnapps?
00: 10: 25,240 -> 00: 10: 27,240
No, thank you, I ate.
00: 10: 29,440 -> 00: 10: 31,520
What's happening?
00: 10: 31,600 -> 00: 10: 34,640
What to do?
I'm just not hungry.
00: 10: 34,720 -> 00: 10: 36,480
Did your father call you?
00: 10: 36,560 -> 00: 10: 38,040
For that grandmother, the dead.
00: 10: 38,120 -> 00: 10: 40,800
"Grandma"!
And do not you remember Aunt Matia?
00: 10: 40,880 -> 00: 10: 42,680
I do not remember.
00: 10: 42,760 -> 00: 10: 44,680
You have to go with him.
00: 10: 44,760 -> 00: 10: 46,480
I can not, I told him.
00: 10: 46,560 -> 00: 10: 49,200
If it is necessary for the will,
I will take the plane.
00: 10: 49,280 -> 00: 10: 52,640
You could help him
for the funeral.
00: 10: 52,720 -> 00: 10: 55,600
As a man grow old, everything is weighing.
00: 10: 55,680 -> 00: 11: 00,440
Do I pity him?
"Past, past, your father is!"
00: 11: 01,400 -> 00: 11: 03,560
You will be glad to go with him.
00: 11: 04,560 -> 00: 11: 06,560
I can not, I do not have time.
00: 11: 08,120 -> 00: 11: 12,960
Do not you want another schnitzel?
No thanks! I'm not hungry.
00: 11: 16,040 -> 00: 11: 17,280
What happened?
00: 11: 17,360 -> 00: 11: 20,960
Nothing, what happened?
I'm not hungry.
00: 11: 21,040 -> 00: 11: 23,200
Are you with Marina?
00: 11: 23,280 -> 00: 11: 25,680
You were.
00: 11: 25,760 -> 00: 11: 27,960
Yes, we met yesterday.
00: 11: 28,040 -> 00: 11: 31,160
And what?
Nothing.
00: 11: 31,240 -> 00: 11: 33,480
I just told her that I ...
00: 11: 33,560 -> 00: 11: 36,680
That I love her that I miss,
that I only think about it.
00: 11: 36,760 -> 00: 11: 38,520
It is still pulling,
00: 11: 38,600 -> 00: 11: 41,640
but he touches me,
talks about my lovely hands ...
00: 11: 41,720 -> 00: 11: 44,280
For the first time, you're nice to her, normal.
00: 11: 44,360 -> 00: 11: 47,200
No, he still loves me!
What are you kidding?
00: 11: 48,040 -> 00: 11: 50,200
He may love you, but ...
00: 11: 52,000 -> 00: 11: 54,080
A big manipulator.
00: 11: 54,160 -> 00: 11: 57,760
Are you gossiping with me?
You see I'm fucked up and you're working on me.
00: 11: 57,840 -> 00: 11: 59,960
I only tell you your opinion.
00: 12: 00,040 -> 00: 12: 02,720
Or do you want fake calming?
00: 12: 02,800 -> 00: 12: 05,120
I thought you liked Marina.
00: 12: 05,200 -> 00: 12: 08,040
When did I say anything else?
I like her but ...
00: 12: 09,480 -> 00: 12: 11,760
I do not understand it.
00: 12: 11,840 -> 00: 12: 13,440
Which?
00: 12: 13,520 -> 00: 12: 15,920
Well see ...
00: 12: 16,000 -> 00: 12: 18,000
Say what happened?
00: 12: 19,400 -> 00: 12: 20,600
Nothing.
00: 12: 20,680 -> 00: 12: 25,080
He talked I was with the chick
at the exhibition in Rome.
00: 12: 25,160 -> 00: 12: 26,200
Is not it like that?
00: 12: 26,280 -> 00: 12: 30,800
For another I speak to you -
I'm annoyed that he does not trust me.
00: 12: 30,880 -> 00: 12: 34,680
You see! You are irritated,
that he does not believe your lies.
00: 12: 34,760 -> 00: 12: 39,400
In general, I told her that ...
00: 12: 39,480 -> 00: 12: 43,400
That I love her, and she, "Why not me
did he say it while we were together? "
00: 12: 43,480 -> 00: 12: 47,360
Here at! He was not nice to her, it was.
Then what?
00: 12: 48,240 -> 00: 12: 50,160
We pressed and ...
00: 12: 50,240 -> 00: 12: 52,040
And ye went unto you.
00: 12: 52,120 -> 00: 12: 56,600
Yes, in Bulgaria. We slept together,
she was very passionate, wonderful.
00: 12: 56,680 -> 00: 12: 59,800
Essentially -
how did she behave in the morning?
00: 12: 59,880 -> 00: 13: 01,800
How would I know? Normally.
 00: 13: 01,880 -> 00: 13: 05,040
Actually, I do not know,
when I woke up, she had gone.
00: 13: 05,120 -> 00: 13: 07,120
Clearly.
00: 13: 07,200 -> 00: 13: 08,680
What is clear?
00: 13: 08,760 -> 00: 13: 11,960
You find it normal
to leave while you sleep?
00: 13: 12,040 -> 00: 13: 13,680
It's strange for me.
00: 13: 13,760 -> 00: 13: 16,960
Everything is fine.
I released her essays in the morning.
00: 13: 17,040 -> 00: 13: 18,560
Is Jesse? What?
00: 13: 18,640 -> 00: 13: 20,640
That I love her, such things.
00: 13: 22,040 -> 00: 13: 23,400
She said what?
00: 13: 23,480 -> 00: 13: 25,480
Nothing for now.
 00: 13: 25,560 -> 00: 13: 27,520
He'll answer for sure.
00: 13: 27,600 -> 00: 13: 30,280
She did not recall.
00: 13: 30,360 -> 00: 13: 32,160
Will answer.
00: 13: 32,240 -> 00: 13: 35,760
How suddenly
so did you start to be with her?
00: 13: 35,840 -> 00: 13: 38,160
What are you suggesting?
00: 13: 38,240 -> 00: 13: 40,880
As you leave,
you did not care much.
00: 13: 40,960 -> 00: 13: 44,720
Apparently I needed time
to understand that ...
00: 13: 44,800 -> 00: 13: 47,680
It is the love of my life.
00: 13: 47,760 -> 00: 13: 49,720
And for Barbara he was talking like that.
00: 13: 49,800 -> 00: 13: 52,960
That's how it was.
And there I fucked things up.
00: 13: 53,040 -> 00: 13: 56,480
It is important now that I do not mistaken again.
Marina will call.
00: 13: 56,560 -> 00: 14: 00,000
She loves me.
It was yesterday.
00: 14: 06,400 -> 00: 14: 08,400
Everything is fine.
00: 15: 02,840 -> 00: 15: 04,680
Good morning.
00: 15: 04,760 -> 00: 15: 06,760
Good morning.
Put the belt.
00: 15: 13,880 -> 00: 15: 16,560
 Is everything all right?

00: 15: 16,640 -> 00: 15: 19,600
 Call now. I will die! 00: 15: 27,240 -> 00: 15: 29,680
Alan? Are we going?
One moment.
00: 15: 31,040 -> 00: 15: 32,840
Come on.
00: 15: 32,920 -> 00: 15: 34,920
Here it is.
00: 15: 40,120 -> 00: 15: 44,280
Back to frame,
in which the duplicate voice enters.
00: 15: 44,360 -> 00: 15: 48,160
The frame the cat eats
our product
00: 15: 48,240 -> 00: 15: 50,280
from a bowl marked "Mustache".
00: 15: 50,360 -> 00: 15: 53,120
Wider than the previous one.
The actor speaks.
00: 15: 53,200 -> 00: 15: 56,000
I will try Slovenian.
I will try.
00: 15: 56,080 -> 00: 15: 59,120
"For your dearest creatures
select Mustache -
 00: 15: 59,200 -> 00: 16: 03,040
cat food, cooked
exclusively from local products,
00: 16: 03,120 -> 00: 16: 05,680
without preservatives and additives. "
00: 16: 08,560 -> 00: 16: 10,480
All right.
00: 16: 10,560 -> 00: 16: 12,560
Goodbye?
00: 16: 18,440 -> 00: 16: 20,440
Star, what do you think?
00: 16: 23,400 -> 00: 16: 25,320
What I? I make the pack.
00: 16: 25,400 -> 00: 16: 27,720
I know, so Lucas got the job.
00: 16: 28,640 -> 00: 16: 30,680
It's with the outside contractors.
00: 16: 35,320 -> 00: 16: 38,800
Do you ask about the ad?
I'm interested in your opinion.
00: 16: 40,040 -> 00: 16: 41,880
She is good.
00: 16: 41,960 -> 00: 16: 43,960
Is that what you say?
 00: 16: 44,000 -> 00: 16: 46,160
It's great.
00: 16: 46,240 -> 00: 16: 50,640
Perhaps the end is a bit sloppy -
with the father and son.
00: 16: 50,720 -> 00: 16: 52,360
I did not understand?
00: 16: 52,440 -> 00: 16: 55,640
I mean,
that sounds a little pathetic ...
00: 16: 55,720 -> 00: 16: 57,720
I'm not sure.
00: 16: 59,640 -> 00: 17: 02,160
All right.
00: 17: 02,240 -> 00: 17: 05,920
Come tomorrow at 7.30 am
With a new proposal.
00: 17: 06,000 -> 00: 17: 08,200
If you want, we'll remove that with ...
00: 17: 08,280 -> 00: 17: 12,920
I will not offer anything to Mr Turk,
in which I'm not sure.
00: 17: 14,560 -> 00: 17: 16,880
All right.
Next. The packaging.
00: 17: 22,040 -> 00: 17: 23,800
That's it. Perfect.
00: 17: 23,880 -> 00: 17: 25,840
I told you, Alan is the best.
00: 17: 25,920 -> 00: 17: 27,920
Wonderful!
00: 17: 28,960 -> 00: 17: 31,120
Maybe only ...
00: 17: 31,200 -> 00: 17: 35,440
The declaration is
in too small a font ... May.
00: 17: 35,480 -> 00: 17: 38,520
This is not a problem at all.
Moment.
00: 17: 38,600 -> 00: 17: 42,200
It's perfect, but you want it
a little more perfect?
00: 17: 42,280 -> 00: 17: 44,280
Would you explain?
00: 17: 45,240 -> 00: 17: 47,080
I do not need to explain.
00: 17: 47,160 -> 00: 17: 49,160
Or can not you?
00: 17: 52,240 -> 00: 17: 53,600
Ah, Mr. Turk!
00: 17: 53,680 -> 00: 17: 55,960
Hello, Mr Turk, how are you today?
00: 17: 56,040 -> 00: 17: 57,560
 Hello, team, how are you? 00: 17: 57,640 -> 00: 18: 01,480
Good day.
Here we are Lucas and the team from Zagreb.
00: 18: 01,560 -> 00: 18: 03,080
I'll see you tomorrow, right?
00: 18: 03,160 -> 00: 18: 06,440
 Install the son of the boat

00: 18: 06,520 -> 00: 18: 08,480
Great!
Until recently!
 00: 18: 08,560 -> 00: 18: 12,440
 Lucas, if I'm late, leave me

00: 18: 12,520 -> 00: 18: 16,480
The daughter arrives specially
from Belgrade with a bottle for you!
00: 18: 16,560 -> 00: 18: 18,960
 I just wanted to hear,

00: 18: 19,040 -> 00: 18: 22,200
 and that we have the best

00: 18: 22,280 -> 00: 18: 24,760
Do not doubt us.
Naturally.
00: 18: 24,840 -> 00: 18: 28,680
 Act now, I leave you.

00: 18: 28,760 -> 00: 18: 31,000
Bye.
Until recently!
00: 18: 31,080 -> 00: 18: 32,840
Goodbye.
00: 18: 32,920 -> 00: 18: 34,320
You're right.
00: 18: 34,400 -> 00: 18: 36,960
The packaging is fine.
00: 18: 37,040 -> 00: 18: 39,440
Not the clip. Tomorrow 7.30 am
00: 18: 39,520 -> 00: 18: 42,200
At the desk waiting for me
three new options.
00: 18: 43,160 -> 00: 18: 46,400
Tomorrow is the celebration in Zagreb.
00: 18: 46,480 -> 00: 18: 49,120
I know, I can not wait.
00: 19: 17,360 -> 00: 19: 19,360
Stop it.
What?
00: 19: 20,480 -> 00: 19: 22,480
Where did he go? Hey!
00: 19: 41,080 -> 00: 19: 43,640
Good day.
I'll call back.
00: 19: 43,720 -> 00: 19: 46,600
Good day.
How can I help you?
00: 19: 50,040 -> 00: 19: 52,200
What is the price of this one?
00: 19: 57,720 -> 00: 20: 00,200
Are you okay?
00: 20: 00,280 -> 00: 20: 02,280
Yes.
00: 20: 03,120 -> 00: 20: 05,120
I will be de.
00: 20: 21,720 -> 00: 20: 23,720
 I called you, the little one. 00: 20: 26,560 -> 00: 20: 28,560
 You are gone.  00: 20: 31,840 -> 00: 20: 35,640
 I never understood

00: 20: 35,720 -> 00: 20: 38,920
 or I wanted to look for you. 00: 20: 42,480 -> 00: 20: 44,800
 Little ... 00: 20: 44,880 -> 00: 20: 48,400
 My little one. 00: 20: 48,520 -> 00: 20: 51,960
 My love, and so far I love you. 00: 20: 54,040 -> 00: 20: 56,640
 Today and forever,  00: 20: 56,720 -> 00: 20: 59,640
 always and forever. 00: 20: 59,720 -> 00: 21: 01,640
 And in the spring, 00: 21: 01,720 -> 00: 21: 05,920
 Just come to me.  00: 21: 06,000 -> 00: 21: 09,520
 Never, never  00: 21: 09,600 -> 00: 21: 11,960
 your eyes were not 00: 21: 12,040 -> 00: 21: 16,840
 as beautiful as then. 00: 21: 18,200 -> 00: 21: 22,760
 You never smiled 00: 21: 24,000 -> 00: 21: 26,600
 as lovely as then, 00: 21: 26,680 -> 00: 21: 28,480
 when it's gone.  00: 21: 28,560 -> 00: 21: 32,480
 Go back, little, 00: 21: 32,560 -> 00: 21: 35,960
 my little one!  00: 21: 36,040 -> 00: 21: 40,800
 My love. I'm the same.  00: 21: 41,880 -> 00: 21: 44,440
 I will love you tomorrow.  00: 21: 44,520 -> 00: 21: 47,200
 I will love you forever, forever. 00: 21: 47,280 -> 00: 21: 49,720
 Even in the spring, 00: 21: 49,800 -> 00: 21: 54,120
 just re-discover 00: 21: 54,200 -> 00: 21: 58,760
 me and you 00: 22: 55,120 -> 00: 22: 59,880
 They accepted the new ad.

00: 23: 19,680 -> 00: 23: 20,800
 Hello. 00: 23: 20,880 -> 00: 23: 22,520
Hello.
00: 23: 22,600 -> 00: 23: 25,120
Where are you?
 Excuse me. 00: 23: 25,200 -> 00: 23: 29,360
 I wanted to call you,

00: 23: 30,280 -> 00: 23: 33,320
Where are you?
 We're drinking coffee with Anna. 00: 23: 34,200 -> 00: 23: 36,040
 We are talking. 00: 23: 36,120 -> 00: 23: 38,120
Can we meet?
00: 23: 39,120 -> 00: 23: 41,120
 I do not know it makes sense. 00: 23: 43,000 -> 00: 23: 45,680
How so? Of course!
00: 23: 45,760 -> 00: 23: 47,680
 Better not. 00: 23: 47,760 -> 00: 23: 49,880
 We told you everything. 00: 23: 49,960 -> 00: 23: 52,200
 I do not see the meaning of meetings. 00: 23: 54,000 -> 00: 23: 56,560
Please.
00: 23: 56,640 -> 00: 23: 58,640
I have a present for you.
00: 24: 17,240 -> 00: 24: 19,240
Hello.
Hello.
00: 24: 21,200 -> 00: 24: 23,800
Do not.
00: 24: 23,880 -> 00: 24: 25,760
Please do not touch me.
00: 24: 25,840 -> 00: 24: 27,760
Why?
00: 24: 27,840 -> 00: 24: 29,840
I told you, it's late.
00: 24: 31,920 -> 00: 24: 34,520
At least sit down somewhere?
I do not want.
 00: 24: 36,440 -> 00: 24: 39,600
I'm going out with a man.
00: 24: 41,040 -> 00: 24: 45,440
I wanted to tell you, but you spoke,
that you love me and ...
00: 24: 45,520 -> 00: 24: 48,080
The memories come alive.
00: 24: 48,160 -> 00: 24: 51,120
I did stupid, sorry.
00: 24: 52,760 -> 00: 24: 54,440
Since when?
00: 24: 54,520 -> 00: 24: 57,160
Around two months.
00: 24: 57,240 -> 00: 24: 59,400
Then we broke up!
00: 25: 00,520 -> 00: 25: 03,160
It may be a month and a half.
00: 25: 04,240 -> 00: 25: 06,240
I do not know.
 00: 25: 09,000 -> 00: 25: 11,280
It started,
while you were with me.
00: 25: 12,760 -> 00: 25: 16,480
There was a year to show me,
that you love me. Do not do it.
00: 25: 17,440 -> 00: 25: 20,800
It would be a lie, if I say,
that I have no feelings but ...
00: 25: 20,880 -> 00: 25: 23,240
That night was a mistake.
00: 25: 24,240 -> 00: 25: 26,840
Excuse me,
that I gave you a false hope.
00: 25: 28,840 -> 00: 25: 30,840
I'm going.
00: 25: 53,480 -> 00: 25: 55,920
We can act with the media
and Zagreb.
00: 25: 56,000 -> 00: 25: 58,480
But leave the coordination
of Slovenia.
00: 25: 58,560 -> 00: 26: 00,760
Knowhauta is important, we have it.
00: 26: 00,840 -> 00: 26: 04,440
Our network can help
on the Croatian market,
00: 26: 04,520 -> 00: 26: 07,160
to consolidate your positions in the region.
00: 26: 10,560 -> 00: 26: 12,760
I want to introduce you
with the star of the team.
00: 26: 12,840 -> 00: 26: 14,840
Moment. Allan!
00: 26: 16,240 -> 00: 26: 18,240
Come to meet you.
00: 26: 21,400 -> 00: 26: 25,040
I'm very pleased, young sir.
My congratulations, great!
00: 26: 25,120 -> 00: 26: 27,600
Great work on the packaging.
00: 26: 27,680 -> 00: 26: 29,360
Great.
With the ears, is not it?
00: 26: 29,440 -> 00: 26: 31,320
Yes, wonderful.
00: 26: 31,400 -> 00: 26: 32,560
Thank you.
00: 26: 32,640 -> 00: 26: 34,760
I was just saying to Mr Turk,
00: 26: 34,840 -> 00: 26: 37,520
that in September
you are invited to Japan.
00: 26: 37,600 -> 00: 26: 39,680
Yes exactly.
00: 26: 41,360 -> 00: 26: 44,040
And my son is busy
with illustration.
00: 26: 44,120 -> 00: 26: 46,120
For fun only.
00: 26: 48,840 -> 00: 26: 51,040
Excuse us,
we have something to discuss.
00: 26: 51,120 -> 00: 26: 53,560
Of course.
Thanks. Come on.
00: 26: 54,720 -> 00: 26: 56,720
Welcome!
00: 27: 07,360 -> 00: 27: 11,520
I know we won this order
thanks to you.
00: 27: 11,600 -> 00: 27: 14,280
And now you are doing demonstrations.
No...
00: 27: 14,360 -> 00: 27: 17,080
Let me finish.
 00: 27: 17,160 -> 00: 27: 21,360
I am aware,
that without you would not go.
00: 27: 21,440 -> 00: 27: 24,120
But most friendly please,
00: 27: 24,200 -> 00: 27: 26,360
let go of a smile.
00: 27: 26,440 -> 00: 27: 28,960
Talk to this ass Turk.
00: 27: 29,040 -> 00: 27: 31,680
Is that fine?
Leave the indulgence to me.
00: 27: 31,760 -> 00: 27: 33,840
But at least respond, smile.
00: 27: 35,040 -> 00: 27: 38,040
Because of me, is that it?
All right.
00: 27: 38,920 -> 00: 27: 40,920
We're going.
00: 28: 00,640 -> 00: 28: 03,320
Hi, Hurts.
Hi, Ace.
00: 28: 03,400 -> 00: 28: 05,400
How much do you want?
Two.
00: 28: 08,320 -> 00: 28: 10,320
Actually three.
00: 28: 25,080 -> 00: 28: 27,080
I was already desperate.
 00: 28: 29,160 -> 00: 28: 31,080
Take it.
 00: 28: 31,160 -> 00: 28: 33,720
You serious?
Take the ring.
00: 28: 33,760 -> 00: 28: 36,640
Are you okay?
Yes simply...
00: 28: 36,720 -> 00: 28: 38,720
Please take it.
00: 28: 47,480 -> 00: 28: 49,480
Thanks.
Wait.
00: 28: 52,640 -> 00: 28: 54,640
Get another one.
00: 29: 00,880 -> 00: 29: 02,880
Get tightened.
00: 29: 20,720 -> 00: 29: 23,160
I constantly repeat:
the client is aware!
00: 29: 23,200 -> 00: 29: 25,120
We bring experience.
 00: 29: 25,160 -> 00: 29: 27,200
Let's say, your vineyards.
00: 29: 27,280 -> 00: 29: 30,760
Invite us to the grape harvest.
Teambuilding will be useful.
 00: 29: 30,840 -> 00: 29: 34,680
Our families
can be a friend.
00: 29: 34,760 -> 00: 29: 39,120
It is no coincidence to say "families".
Become a family.
00: 29: 39,200 -> 00: 29: 42,360
The purpose is not important, but the path to it.
00: 29: 42,440 -> 00: 29: 45,200
Hello.
Hello.
 00: 29: 46,680 -> 00: 29: 49,560
I really wanted it
to meet you.
00: 29: 50,800 -> 00: 29: 54,160
With us?
Is there anyone else?
 00: 29: 55,640 -> 00: 29: 59,560
My dad told me
very nice things for you.
 00: 29: 59,640 -> 00: 30: 01,760
Who is your father?
Lucas.
00: 30: 01,840 -> 00: 30: 05,440
Lucas! You are the daughter of Lucas.
00: 30: 05,480 -> 00: 30: 07,600
Yes.
Great.
00: 30: 07,640 -> 00: 30: 10,640
Allan.
I know. I'm Marina.
00: 30: 10,720 -> 00: 30: 15,360
I came to see my father,
I follow graphic design in Belgrade.
00: 30: 15,440 -> 00: 30: 17,040
What's wrong?
00: 30: 17,120 -> 00: 30: 19,720
Your name is Marina, is not it?
00: 30: 19,800 -> 00: 30: 21,920
You feed me.
00: 30: 40,520 -> 00: 30: 43,120
 Another man took it away from me. 00: 30: 43,200 -> 00: 30: 45,840
 She took my delicate flower. 00: 30: 47,360 -> 00: 30: 52,240
 It does not care

00: 30: 55,920 -> 00: 30: 57,920
Where did he go?
00: 31: 01,480 -> 00: 31: 03,400
 How am I going to live alone?  00: 31: 03,480 -> 00: 31: 06,480
 My soul hurts. 00: 31: 07,320 -> 00: 31: 08,480
What's wrong?
 00: 31: 08,560 -> 00: 31: 10,720
 Another man took it away from me. 00: 31: 10,800 -> 00: 31: 13,640
 She took my delicate flower. Не го е грижа
За г-н Турк, от Лукаснай-нежната.00: 31: 42,520 -> 00: 31: 45,160
 She was my light, 00: 31: 45,240 -> 00: 31: 47,880
 a brilliant river. 00: 31: 59,560 -> 00: 32: 01,560
What, was an idiot?
00: 32: 03,200 -> 00: 32: 05,040
 Another man unravels her hair, 00: 32: 05,120 -> 00: 32: 08,640
 I love her.  00: 32: 10,160 -> 00: 32: 12,200
 How am I going to live alone?  00: 32: 12,240 -> 00: 32: 14,400
 My soul hurts. 00: 32: 17,880 -> 00: 32: 20,240
Come on, bastard! I killed you!
 00: 32: 20,320 -> 00: 32: 21,640
Fuck you.
00: 32: 21,800 -> 00: 32: 23,800
Get out.
00: 32: 35,480 -> 00: 32: 36,800
What next?
00: 32: 36,880 -> 00: 32: 40,560
We will fill out a report,
there will be punishment.
00: 32: 40,640 -> 00: 32: 45,000
We repeat the same thing all night.
00: 32: 45,080 -> 00: 32: 47,720
I'm his mother.
Get in, excuse me.
00: 34: 37,960 -> 00: 34: 39,960
Wake me up the alarm.
00: 35: 01,560 -> 00: 35: 03,560
The rest is set.
00: 35: 15,080 -> 00: 35: 17,080
I'm sorry.
00: 35: 31,600 -> 00: 35: 33,600
It is very tough for me.
00: 35: 35,600 -> 00: 35: 37,840
I'm very sick.
00: 35: 37,920 -> 00: 35: 40,920
Invalid.
Because you love her?
00: 35: 43,960 -> 00: 35: 46,040
Or is he afraid of himself?
00: 35: 47,640 -> 00: 35: 49,640
In what sense?
00: 35: 56,400 -> 00: 35: 58,400
That you will end up like your father.
00: 36: 04,600 -> 00: 36: 06,720
Do not tell Bruno about that.
00: 36: 07,880 -> 00: 36: 09,880
I did not tell him.
00: 36: 11,880 -> 00: 36: 13,880
Go with your father to Vis.
00: 36: 14,920 -> 00: 36: 17,480
Go on today.
00: 36: 17,560 -> 00: 36: 22,280
Bruno leaves in two hours.
And stay there until you're done.
00: 36: 22,360 -> 00: 36: 24,800
Just for that I ask.
But ...
00: 36: 24,880 -> 00: 36: 26,880
I do not accept a denial.
00: 36: 27,800 -> 00: 36: 29,800
Please!
00: 37: 21,120 -> 00: 37: 22,960
Hello.
00: 37: 23,040 -> 00: 37: 24,920
Olele, Alan, what happened?
00: 37: 25,000 -> 00: 37: 27,680
Nothing. Everything is fine.
00: 37: 28,520 -> 00: 37: 32,240
Will you go to Vis?
I'm leaving in 15 minutes.
 00: 37: 33,080 -> 00: 37: 35,360
May I come?
00: 37: 35,440 -> 00: 37: 37,840
Of course. Get in.
00: 37: 37,920 -> 00: 37: 40,840
I wait for it to dry out,
what I do.
00: 37: 40,920 -> 00: 37: 42,880
Look what's going on.
00: 37: 42,960 -> 00: 37: 46,440
Waste moisture on the wall,
just such a blob.
00: 37: 46,520 -> 00: 37: 48,920
I have to cover here.
00: 37: 53,960 -> 00: 37: 56,400
Will there be a place?
The car is crowded.
00: 37: 56,480 -> 00: 37: 59,880
There will be room.
I'll put the pictures back.
00: 37: 59,960 -> 00: 38: 02,360
Do not tighten.
00: 38: 02,440 -> 00: 38: 06,640
We will get through with us,
to take a funeral suit.
00: 38: 06,720 -> 00: 38: 10,320
And that-that ... Cafe.
A coffee maker?
00: 38: 10,400 -> 00: 38: 12,720
Small, portable, pocket.
00: 38: 13,720 -> 00: 38: 16,840
It's a yacht.
"Do you already have a yacht?"
 00: 38: 16,920 -> 00: 38: 18,920
No, that's the coffee maker.
00: 38: 20,440 -> 00: 38: 22,600
Do you like?
00: 38: 22,680 -> 00: 38: 25,000
Look at this.
00: 38: 25,080 -> 00: 38: 27,080
The new toy.
00: 38: 28,520 -> 00: 38: 30,960
Do you get it?
What?
00: 38: 31,040 -> 00: 38: 33,200
The trick is the right tree.
00: 38: 33,280 -> 00: 38: 37,120
To see the fish in it,
to see its shape.
00: 38: 37,200 -> 00: 38: 39,200
I understand.
00: 38: 40,080 -> 00: 38: 42,080
OK.
00: 38: 48,720 -> 00: 38: 50,720
Do you live here?
00: 40: 06,960 -> 00: 40: 08,960
What is this?
00: 40: 10,440 -> 00: 40: 13,680
She said you needed a coffee maker.
00: 40: 14,560 -> 00: 40: 17,800
Yes, but I have a small yacht,
pocket format.
00: 40: 17,880 -> 00: 40: 19,880
Does this come in a pocket?
00: 40: 24,960 -> 00: 40: 26,320
Why did not you wake me up?
00: 40: 26,400 -> 00: 40: 30,520
Why did you tell me what you need -
costume and coffee maker.
00: 40: 30,560 -> 00: 40: 32,080
You have them.
00: 40: 32,160 -> 00: 40: 34,720
And the other?
What else?
00: 40: 34,800 -> 00: 40: 39,920
Costume for the funeral
and a coffee maker that said.
00: 40: 40,000 -> 00: 40: 43,560
I said "a suit,
a coffee maker and this one more. "
00: 40: 43,640 -> 00: 40: 46,080
Other things,
which I use
00: 40: 46,160 -> 00: 40: 48,960
in the rare moments,
when I'm out of the cemetery.
00: 40: 49,040 -> 00: 40: 53,280
Are not they in the backpack?
Which backpack?
00: 40: 53,360 -> 00: 40: 55,320
Have you seen me with a backpack?
00: 40: 57,480 -> 00: 40: 59,480
Fuck him.
00: 41: 01,000 -> 00: 41: 03,000
The top.
 00: 41: 05,240 -> 00: 41: 07,440
Are you okay?
00: 41: 07,520 -> 00: 41: 09,960
Better than ever.
00: 41: 10,800 -> 00: 41: 13,640
I ask more in common.
Is everything alright?
00: 41: 14,920 -> 00: 41: 17,640
Everything is fine.
00: 41: 17,720 -> 00: 41: 20,480
Why?
Just asking.
00: 41: 22,680 -> 00: 41: 25,000
Because of the apartment?
00: 41: 28,080 -> 00: 41: 30,720
I did a party, a little bit we did.
00: 41: 31,880 -> 00: 41: 34,040
Big deal.
 00: 41: 34,160 -> 00: 41: 36,200
You do not know how it is.
00: 41: 37,880 -> 00: 41: 39,880
How's Marina?
00: 41: 40,920 -> 00: 41: 43,000
Magic.
00: 41: 44,600 -> 00: 41: 47,920
Her pallet is a great sweetheart.
00: 41: 48,000 -> 00: 41: 50,800
Jack Russell was your name?
00: 41: 50,880 -> 00: 41: 54,840
Jack Rushell is the breed.
Jack Russell Terrier.
00: 41: 54,920 -> 00: 41: 57,600
And what is it called?
Gytha.
00: 41: 57,680 -> 00: 41: 59,680
True, Gita. How's Gita?
00: 42: 01,160 -> 00: 42: 02,840
Dead.
00: 42: 02,920 -> 00: 42: 04,160
A car overcame it.
00: 42: 04,240 -> 00: 42: 06,720
Seriously? When?
00: 42: 06,800 -> 00: 42: 08,800
Five months ago.
00: 42: 10,000 -> 00: 42: 12,000
True?
 00: 42: 18,400 -> 00: 42: 21,840
I remembered something.
Give that video cable.
00: 42: 23,240 -> 00: 42: 27,560
The adapter is in the compartment below.
00: 42: 28,480 -> 00: 42: 30,480
Put him in here.
 00: 42: 31,320 -> 00: 42: 35,360
What is this?
Charger for mobile, what!
00: 42: 35,440 -> 00: 42: 37,600
The battery has fallen,
I'm still loading it.
00: 42: 37,640 -> 00: 42: 39,800
He had bought a normal charger.
00: 42: 39,920 -> 00: 42: 43,280
Why break money?
I did this in no time.
 00: 42: 45,440 -> 00: 42: 47,480
Or buy a normal phone.
00: 42: 47,560 -> 00: 42: 49,560
Normal, enough.
00: 44: 17,200 -> 00: 44: 18,840
What?
00: 44: 18,920 -> 00: 44: 20,920
Bruno!
00: 44: 21,920 -> 00: 44: 23,680
Eagle.
00: 44: 23,760 -> 00: 44: 26,400
We caught an eel.
00: 44: 26,480 -> 00: 44: 28,480
What are you going to do?
00: 45: 20,560 -> 00: 45: 23,840
Quiet, do not get so heavy.
00: 45: 23,880 -> 00: 45: 26,160
The leg no longer hurts me.
00: 45: 26,240 -> 00: 45: 28,440
Hi, Grandma.
00: 45: 28,520 -> 00: 45: 31,920
What Vis? In the wilderness.
00: 45: 32,000 -> 00: 45: 36,880
My gas is over. Yes, horror.
Send a bottle from the kitchen.
00: 45: 38,240 -> 00: 45: 40,520
Yes, the mail works.
00: 45: 40,640 -> 00: 45: 43,440
You can!
Take the shopping cart.
00: 47: 33,920 -> 00: 47: 36,400
As is the case on the island.
00: 47: 36,440 -> 00: 47: 38,640
We'll fix it somehow.
00: 47: 38,720 -> 00: 47: 41,680
Is this the tax?
No, Alan.
00: 47: 41,760 -> 00: 47: 43,560
Alan? Is that you!
Hello.
00: 47: 43,640 -> 00: 47: 45,680
Has anyone grown you?
00: 47: 45,760 -> 00: 47: 48,640
What kind ...
00: 47: 48,720 -> 00: 47: 51,640
Watch it! Like James Bond.
00: 47: 51,720 -> 00: 47: 54,920
I was not, I fell for a match.
00: 47: 56,400 -> 00: 47: 59,160
You said,
that your leg no longer hurt you?
00: 47: 59,240 -> 00: 48: 01,040
I started again.
00: 48: 01,120 -> 00: 48: 03,800
Kafence?
If possible, espresso.
00: 48: 07,160 -> 00: 48: 09,640
You look good.
00: 48: 09,720 -> 00: 48: 11,640
Why did not you get dressed yet?
00: 48: 11,720 -> 00: 48: 13,920
The funeral is tomorrow.
00: 48: 14,000 -> 00: 48: 15,800
Tomorrow?
Yes.
00: 48: 15,880 -> 00: 48: 19,160
And the other formalities?
Today, at 4 pm
00: 48: 19,240 -> 00: 48: 22,440
Why did we come yesterday?
That's not the case.
00: 48: 22,520 -> 00: 48: 25,880
To arrange the funeral,
to be a priest.
00: 48: 25,960 -> 00: 48: 29,240
See for the vigil.
It's disgusting.
 00: 48: 29,320 -> 00: 48: 33,040
Which?
People still use "comic sanse".
00: 48: 33,120 -> 00: 48: 36,880
Please?
"Comics Sans", the font of the letters.
00: 48: 38,160 -> 00: 48: 39,880
You know?
00: 48: 39,960 -> 00: 48: 41,960
What should I do?
00: 48: 43,200 -> 00: 48: 45,280
I'm going to negotiate the funeral.
00: 48: 45,360 -> 00: 48: 49,080
If you want, talk to the priest.
00: 48: 49,160 -> 00: 48: 52,120
Until the reading of the will
to be ready.
00: 48: 52,200 -> 00: 48: 56,360
Give him a hundred bucks,
he will still think of something.
00: 48: 56,440 -> 00: 48: 58,240
And, then, "no humor," right?
00: 48: 58,320 -> 00: 49: 01,960
Who without humor?
"Comic Sans", in French.
00: 49: 02,040 -> 00: 49: 05,600
Yes, if translated literally.
But it is not.
00: 49: 05,680 -> 00: 49: 08,520
The term is in the field of design.
 00: 49: 08,600 -> 00: 49: 11,640
In the case of fonts, sanny means
without spins,
00: 49: 11,720 -> 00: 49: 14,320
without the decorations of the letters.
00: 49: 14,400 -> 00: 49: 18,160
What have you bothered me about?
No, it's just interesting.
00: 49: 18,240 -> 00: 49: 20,480
Come on. What's happening?
 00: 49: 20,560 -> 00: 49: 23,920
We wondered why you chose it
"comic sanse" for sugar.
00: 49: 24,920 -> 00: 49: 27,040
I'll get you brown.
 00: 49: 30,120 -> 00: 49: 32,320
Do I just go to the church?
00: 49: 32,360 -> 00: 49: 34,880
I barely drew my leg hurts.
00: 49: 34,960 -> 00: 49: 38,240
Take the wheel.
Which wheel?
 00: 49: 38,320 -> 00: 49: 40,800
Do you still keep the wheel?
"It's perfect.
00: 49: 40,880 -> 00: 49: 42,880
So long as you get the hang of him.
00: 49: 46,640 -> 00: 49: 49,800
I do not have a hundred bucks.
"What a hundred kunas?"
00: 49: 49,880 -> 00: 49: 51,520
For the priest.
I have no money.
00: 49: 51,600 -> 00: 49: 54,280
He did not take my wallet.
True.
 00: 49: 54,360 -> 00: 49: 56,720
I'll give you money.
 00: 49: 56,800 -> 00: 49: 59,200
Take, that's all.
00: 50: 00,200 -> 00: 50: 02,720
The last three sacks
Brown sugar.
00: 50: 05,880 -> 00: 50: 08,960
A full car with paintings I drive you.
00: 50: 09,040 -> 00: 50: 11,080
And something new wooden fish.
 00: 50: 11,160 -> 00: 50: 14,320
This is already good.
Hang them up next to Yabuka.
00: 50: 19,360 -> 00: 50: 22,280
You know about Yabuka?
00: 50: 22,360 -> 00: 50: 23,720
What about Yabuka?
00: 50: 23,800 -> 00: 50: 27,000
Bruno leads a woman,
she shows her picture of Yabuka.
00: 50: 27,080 -> 00: 50: 30,280
And what do you say to her, Bruno?
"Yabuka is ..."
00: 50: 30,360 -> 00: 50: 32,640
No, see ...
00: 50: 32,720 -> 00: 50: 34,480
Yabuka is not an island.
 00: 50: 34,560 -> 00: 50: 37,200
It's not an island.
Yabuka does not have a pier.
00: 50: 37,280 -> 00: 50: 39,360
He does not accept shipwrecks.
00: 50: 40,200 -> 00: 50: 44,360
It's hard to get anchor
in its deep waters.
00: 50: 44,440 -> 00: 50: 46,800
In times of oars and sails
00: 50: 46,880 -> 00: 50: 51,280
only the most courageous fishermen,
gifted by nature with curiosity
00: 50: 51,360 -> 00: 50: 54,840
to experience the limits
of human capabilities,
00: 50: 54,920 -> 00: 51: 00,200
have tasted the winter aroma
of the black volcanic apple.
00: 51: 04,520 -> 00: 51: 07,680
You know?
No.
00: 51: 07,760 -> 00: 51: 10,200
It is like the island of Yabuka.
00: 51: 10,280 -> 00: 51: 13,680
That's what I did. But it's a big stupidity.
00: 51: 16,240 -> 00: 51: 18,000
I'm going to the priest.
00: 51: 18,160 -> 00: 51: 20,760
Stay, drink your coffee.
00: 51: 20,840 -> 00: 51: 22,720
Dangerous. Black suit ...
00: 51: 22,800 -> 00: 51: 25,560
There is no joke with him.
"Comic Sans".
00: 51: 25,600 -> 00: 51: 27,600
Please?
No joke.
00: 51: 37,600 -> 00: 51: 40,880
I did not tell him,
but in the morning I saw his ex.
00: 51: 40,960 -> 00: 51: 42,400
Which ex?
00: 51: 42,440 -> 00: 51: 44,440
That Barbara.
00: 53: 05,560 -> 00: 53: 07,560
Barbara!
00: 53: 09,480 -> 00: 53: 11,480
Alan?
 00: 53: 13,920 -> 00: 53: 16,400
What's wrong?
00: 53: 16,480 -> 00: 53: 19,880
I wait for a priest to arrange
Aunt Matia's funeral.
00: 53: 19,960 -> 00: 53: 21,960
What's on your face?
00: 53: 23,560 -> 00: 53: 26,440
Someone bothered a woman,
I intervened.
00: 53: 27,760 -> 00: 53: 29,760
But let him see it!
00: 53: 31,360 -> 00: 53: 34,040
Was she aunt Matia?
00: 53: 34,120 -> 00: 53: 36,840
Yes, but how do you know who it is?
00: 53: 36,920 -> 00: 53: 38,360
How not to know!
00: 53: 38,440 -> 00: 53: 41,280
The grandmother,
where you went as a child.
00: 53: 42,080 -> 00: 53: 44,520
Is the funeral today?
Tomorrow.
00: 53: 45,360 -> 00: 53: 48,120
When I saw the suit and ...
00: 53: 50,400 -> 00: 53: 52,400
Why are you here?
00: 53: 54,000 -> 00: 53: 55,840
We came with my friend.
 00: 53: 55,920 -> 00: 53: 58,560
We roam the islands.
00: 53: 58,640 -> 00: 54: 01,320
And, behold, we are today at Vis.
00: 54: 02,880 -> 00: 54: 04,520
Your boyfriend has a boat.
00: 54: 04,600 -> 00: 54: 06,600
Motorbike.
Motor!
00: 54: 09,480 -> 00: 54: 11,480
His father is.
00: 54: 16,240 -> 00: 54: 18,240
You look great.
00: 54: 19,080 -> 00: 54: 21,120
You also.
00: 54: 21,200 -> 00: 54: 23,240
One such ...
00: 54: 25,000 -> 00: 54: 27,559
Serious.
00: 54: 27,560 -> 00: 54: 30,720
Many years passed ...
00: 54: 33,120 -> 00: 54: 35,040
Five.
Five.
00: 54: 35,120 -> 00: 54: 37,120
Do you have a girlfriend?
00: 54: 37,960 -> 00: 54: 40,880
Yes, I have. Actually ...
00: 54: 40,960 -> 00: 54: 44,160
I have, why?
00: 54: 44,240 -> 00: 54: 47,360
Just asking.
00: 54: 47,440 -> 00: 54: 50,680
And you? Relationship ли е?
00: 54: 54,040 -> 00: 54: 56,040
Well yes.
00: 55: 01,600 -> 00: 55: 04,600
You are ready now, dressed.
00: 55: 05,680 -> 00: 55: 09,320
But we're not one of those marriage services
like in Vegas.
00: 55: 09,400 -> 00: 55: 10,600
You're coming for a wedding, are not you?
00: 55: 10,680 -> 00: 55: 11,960
Yes.
No.
00: 55: 12,040 -> 00: 55: 13,120
Yes.
00: 55: 13,200 -> 00: 55: 15,200
Last yes or no?
00: 55: 16,160 -> 00: 55: 18,960
No, it did come for ...
No.
00: 55: 19,040 -> 00: 55: 21,800
We came to arrange the wedding.
00: 55: 21,880 -> 00: 55: 25,800
Yes, we have already heard, we have negotiated
details, is not it, Barbara?
00: 55: 26,640 -> 00: 55: 28,640
And you are...
00: 55: 30,040 -> 00: 55: 32,040
Peter?
00: 55: 33,600 -> 00: 55: 35,840
No, there is a misunderstanding.
00: 55: 35,920 -> 00: 55: 38,520
That is ...
00: 55: 38,600 -> 00: 55: 41,840
Find out about the funeral.
00: 55: 41,920 -> 00: 55: 44,800
Alan, I'll wait for you outside.
00: 56: 01,960 -> 00: 56: 04,920
Sorry, I could not tell you
and became embarrassed.
00: 56: 04,960 -> 00: 56: 08,040
You forgive.
It was silly on my part.
00: 56: 09,000 -> 00: 56: 11,000
I'm ghostly brave.
00: 56: 21,360 -> 00: 56: 23,680
Is that so?
Омъжваш се.
00: 56: 25,800 -> 00: 56: 29,160
Yes. We have not set the date.
00: 56: 29,240 -> 00: 56: 32,920
We prefer in the spring
or summer, on an island.
00: 56: 33,000 -> 00: 56: 36,400
I know. You've loved Wis since.
00: 56: 36,480 -> 00: 56: 38,040
I hope you are not mad?
00: 56: 38,160 -> 00: 56: 40,960
No, why am I angry?
00: 56: 41,040 -> 00: 56: 43,000
It's wonderful.
00: 56: 43,080 -> 00: 56: 45,560
Why be angry!
00: 56: 45,640 -> 00: 56: 48,200
We also discussed Marina with Vis.
00: 56: 48,280 -> 00: 56: 51,080
Is that your girlfriend?
Yes.
00: 56: 51,160 -> 00: 56: 53,440
Are you engaged?
00: 56: 53,520 -> 00: 56: 56,080
Not yet.
00: 56: 56,160 -> 00: 56: 58,160
But that will happen.
00: 57: 01,560 -> 00: 57: 03,560
How long is the funeral tomorrow?
00: 57: 04,440 -> 00: 57: 07,520
The priest calls us
at the cemetery at 4 pm Why?
00: 57: 07,600 -> 00: 57: 10,760
If we are still here,
to stay for the funeral.
00: 57: 10,840 -> 00: 57: 13,840
If you do not mind.
On the contrary.
00: 57: 13,920 -> 00: 57: 15,920
All right.
00: 57: 17,080 -> 00: 57: 19,600
OK.
00: 57: 19,680 -> 00: 57: 21,680
I'll see you tomorrow.
00: 57: 25,840 -> 00: 57: 28,760
If not earlier, at 4 pm?
00: 57: 30,320 -> 00: 57: 32,320
All right.
00: 57: 53,600 -> 00: 57: 55,040
Say?
00: 57: 55,120 -> 00: 57: 57,760
 Where are you? What's wrong?
00: 57: 57,840 -> 00: 58: 00,840
 Is everything okay? Yes what?
00: 58: 00,920 -> 00: 58: 04,040
 Is it going to ... Yes, we have.
00: 58: 04,120 -> 00: 58: 06,720
 Tomorrow at 16 o'clock at the cemetery. All right.
00: 58: 06,800 -> 00: 58: 08,960
He's done tomorrow at 4 pm
00: 58: 09,040 -> 00: 58: 11,600
Do you know who's on Vis?
00: 58: 11,640 -> 00: 58: 14,320
 I know. Barbara. So you know.
00: 58: 14,440 -> 00: 58: 16,760
 You will come straight

00: 58: 24,040 -> 00: 58: 26,040
Thank you.
00: 59: 42,960 -> 00: 59: 46,800
Do you always paint with an official shirt?
Shit ...
 00: 59: 46,880 -> 00: 59: 49,720
Sorry ...
It is my fault.
00: 59: 52,960 -> 00: 59: 56,360
What happened to your face?
Life.
00: 59: 56,480 -> 01: 00: 00,120
I'm in deep depression.
Allan.
01: 00: 00,200 -> 01: 00: 03,520
Hi, I'm Sophie, nice.
01: 00: 03,600 -> 01: 00: 07,520
Great place.
What is this?
01: 00: 08,600 -> 01: 00: 13,760
It depends what you see on her.
What do you see?
01: 00: 13,800 -> 01: 00: 16,800
Fish.
You're amazed!
01: 00: 16,880 -> 01: 00: 18,880
I would not think.
01: 00: 21,560 -> 01: 00: 23,560
Hello.
Hello.
01: 00: 28,920 -> 01: 00: 31,280
Very interesting pictures.
01: 00: 31,360 -> 01: 00: 32,920
Thanks.
01: 00: 33,000 -> 01: 00: 37,240
Are you the author?
No, my father.
01: 00: 37,320 -> 01: 00: 41,080
I understand. And I see the resemblance.
01: 00: 41,160 -> 01: 00: 45,640
Hope you say it a joke.
Look...
01: 00: 45,720 -> 01: 00: 48,400
Allan.
Where is my upbringing?
01: 00: 48,520 -> 01: 00: 51,240
Anna. And this is my daughter Sophie.
Did you get acquainted?
01: 00: 51,320 -> 01: 00: 53,320
Yes, we met.
01: 00: 55,240 -> 01: 00: 58,520
Can you recommend us?
a nice place for lunch?
01: 00: 58,560 -> 01: 01: 01,800
How long have you been to Vis?
Several days.
01: 01: 01,880 -> 01: 01: 03,880
If we liked it.
01: 01: 05,240 -> 01: 01: 07,360
There are many nice restaurants,
01: 01: 07,440 -> 01: 01: 11,720
but try it
and the restaurant next to us "Papa".
01: 01: 11,800 -> 01: 01: 16,280
Papa is the owner's nickname,
means "father".
01: 01: 16,360 -> 01: 01: 19,160
Tell him he sends you 007.
01: 01: 21,600 -> 01: 01: 25,160
Okay, 007, you're very kind.
At your service.
01: 01: 26,080 -> 01: 01: 28,840
Excuse me, what's on your face?
01: 01: 28,920 -> 01: 01: 32,400
You know how he's in the secret services ...
01: 01: 32,480 -> 01: 01: 34,640
It's super secret.
01: 01: 34,720 -> 01: 01: 37,120
He is in deep depression.
01: 01: 38,240 -> 01: 01: 41,840
All right. Goodbye!
Bye.
01: 01: 47,240 -> 01: 01: 49,200
Please?
 Are not you coming? 01: 01: 49,280 -> 01: 01: 52,720
Where?
For the will 16, 15 am!
01: 01: 52,800 -> 01: 01: 55,400
 Where are you? "To have remembered me!
01: 01: 55,480 -> 01: 01: 58,280
I tried! Close me. Hello ...
01: 02: 36,000 -> 01: 02: 38,000
Run a bit!
01: 02: 41,000 -> 01: 02: 42,640
Excuse me.
01: 02: 42,720 -> 01: 02: 44,720
Come on, we're going.
01: 02: 55,160 -> 01: 02: 59,080
Good day. Excuse us,
while arranging the funeral and ...
01: 03: 00,360 -> 01: 03: 02,400
Good day.
01: 03: 07,600 -> 01: 03: 11,840
That's it. We got together.
We can start.
01: 03: 16,360 -> 01: 03: 20,600
"I, Matia Eva Carusa,
with address "Podpsile" 1,
01: 03: 20,680 -> 01: 03: 24,320
in clear consciousness and free will
01: 03: 24,400 -> 01: 03: 27,600
I make the following testament:
01: 03: 27,680 -> 01: 03: 30,720
20-liter binon with wine leave
01: 03: 30,800 -> 01: 03: 34,320
of nephew Bruno and his son Alan,
01: 03: 34,400 -> 01: 03: 36,320
I hope you enjoy them.
01: 03: 36,400 -> 01: 03: 40,640
Again, I will
family album with photos.
01: 03: 40,720 -> 01: 03: 45,640
Your house, located at
"Podpile" 1, I bequeath
01: 03: 45,720 -> 01: 03: 50,320
of Angel Mardesic,
the love of my life.
01: 03: 54,400 -> 01: 03: 57,600
The will reflects
my last wish,
01: 03: 57,680 -> 01: 04: 00,040
declared in full consciousness. "
01: 04: 17,280 -> 01: 04: 19,840
I understand her.
01: 04: 19,920 -> 01: 04: 22,280
Where to go a small town ...
01: 04: 22,360 -> 01: 04: 24,360
Naturally, they will hide.
01: 04: 26,680 -> 01: 04: 28,680
And I would be hiding.
01: 04: 29,680 -> 01: 04: 33,040
If he had learned ...
Two women!
01: 04: 36,960 -> 01: 04: 40,640
True, now the world has changed.
01: 04: 40,720 -> 01: 04: 42,640
Still...
01: 04: 42,720 -> 01: 04: 45,480
But even today it seems crazy.
01: 04: 46,320 -> 01: 04: 50,560
But imagine it 30 years ago!
No, before 50!
01: 04: 51,920 -> 01: 04: 53,920
One Lord knows how long it is.
01: 04: 58,000 -> 01: 05: 01,880
Watch. Here you are three years old.
01: 05: 01,960 -> 01: 05: 04,160
Is that you?
Yes.
01: 05: 04,240 -> 01: 05: 07,400
No way!
You scratched your father's skin.
01: 05: 07,480 -> 01: 05: 09,480
That much.
01: 05: 13,920 -> 01: 05: 17,720
But how these pictures are
in Aunt Matia's album?
01: 05: 21,640 -> 01: 05: 23,800
Barbara!
Hi, Bruno.
01: 05: 23,880 -> 01: 05: 25,880
Hello dear.
01: 05: 26,840 -> 01: 05: 28,920
Allan told me you had seen me.
01: 05: 30,040 -> 01: 05: 33,320
How are you? How cool you are!
01: 05: 33,400 -> 01: 05: 35,840
You're scary.
You, too!
01: 05: 37,680 -> 01: 05: 39,200
Meet Peter.
01: 05: 39,280 -> 01: 05: 41,160
Hello.
Hello.
01: 05: 41,240 -> 01: 05: 42,280
Peter, huh?
01: 05: 42,360 -> 01: 05: 45,680
Peter. But once we are in Croatia,
maybe Peter.
01: 05: 45,760 -> 01: 05: 50,200
Peter, if that's the name.
I'm Bruno. Come in.
01: 05: 51,520 -> 01: 05: 53,600
Hello, Allan.
Hello.
01: 05: 53,680 -> 01: 05: 55,440
Alan Peter. Meet.
01: 05: 55,520 -> 01: 05: 57,480
What about your Alan?
01: 05: 57,560 -> 01: 05: 59,840
I've listened very much to you.
01: 05: 59,920 -> 01: 06: 03,360
Famous designer.
Or a designer of celebrities?
01: 06: 03,480 -> 01: 06: 05,560
I know something like that.
01: 06: 05,640 -> 01: 06: 09,240
And you are his father?
No, his younger brother.
01: 06: 10,480 -> 01: 06: 13,400
Drink one.
Our wine is divine.
01: 06: 13,480 -> 01: 06: 17,720
No, thank you, we just turned away
to see Peter's Pappe Restaurant.
01: 06: 17,800 -> 01: 06: 21,840
Good job!
Since when we have not seen each other. Sit down!
01: 06: 21,880 -> 01: 06: 25,680
Papa!
Bring two cups.
01: 06: 25,760 -> 01: 06: 28,440
My favorite word!
Hello, Papa.
01: 06: 30,000 -> 01: 06: 31,680
How are you?
How about you?
01: 06: 31,760 -> 01: 06: 34,160
Wonderful. Already. Come on.
01: 06: 34,240 -> 01: 06: 36,040
Peter.
01: 06: 36,120 -> 01: 06: 38,160
Peter?
No, Peter.
01: 06: 38,240 -> 01: 06: 40,560
I'll call you Peter.
01: 06: 40,640 -> 01: 06: 43,120
Are you hungry? I have a specialty!
01: 06: 43,200 -> 01: 06: 45,360
Octopus with nine tentacles.
01: 06: 46,440 -> 01: 06: 50,520
For drinking?
Bruno mentioned some wine.
01: 06: 50,600 -> 01: 06: 53,720
The deceased.
It's great. I'll bring you cups.
01: 06: 56,280 -> 01: 06: 58,160
Aunt Matia's wine?
01: 06: 58,240 -> 01: 07: 01,120
Yes, that's why we came to Vis.
01: 07: 02,040 -> 01: 07: 06,120
Aunt Matia knew
what we love with Alan.
01: 07: 07,120 -> 01: 07: 09,600
Wine is world class.
01: 07: 09,680 -> 01: 07: 13,960
The same Aunt Matia,
where we go to the funeral.
01: 07: 14,040 -> 01: 07: 15,960
My condolences.
01: 07: 16,040 -> 01: 07: 18,240
You will come to the funeral.
01: 07: 18,320 -> 01: 07: 21,920
Peter wanted to
to look for some vines.
01: 07: 22,000 -> 01: 07: 25,680
Are you buying Viscos vineyards?
My father buys.
01: 07: 25,760 -> 01: 07: 28,680
Crab is from money,
I only look at life.
01: 07: 29,760 -> 01: 07: 33,000
Pleasure.
Peter, do not say that.
01: 07: 33,080 -> 01: 07: 36,600
Works for his father,
helps the company.
01: 07: 36,680 -> 01: 07: 39,160
Do any work.
01: 07: 39,240 -> 01: 07: 41,600
Recently illustrated a booklet.
01: 07: 41,680 -> 01: 07: 44,120
It was a charity.
01: 07: 44,240 -> 01: 07: 47,480
It's not my job.
Moment, how's your family?
01: 07: 47,560 -> 01: 07: 49,680
Did you come out of college?
01: 07: 49,760 -> 01: 07: 51,680
It's not my profession.
01: 07: 51,760 -> 01: 07: 54,600
Hobbies rather to have fun.
01: 07: 54,680 -> 01: 07: 57,440
Have fun, you care!
01: 07: 57,480 -> 01: 07: 59,480
Yes, what I care.
01: 08: 01,440 -> 01: 08: 03,200
But you are an artist, are not you?
01: 08: 03,280 -> 01: 08: 05,920
"We"? Is there anyone else?
01: 08: 06,000 -> 01: 08: 07,520
All right, to you.
01: 08: 07,600 -> 01: 08: 11,120
Yes. Here, these are my paintings.
01: 08: 11,200 -> 01: 08: 13,200
All of them.
Great.
01: 08: 13,280 -> 01: 08: 16,560
Your inspiration is mainly Vis.
That's right.
01: 08: 16,640 -> 01: 08: 20,600
And your son is a designer.
Blood is thicker than water.
01: 08: 20,680 -> 01: 08: 22,360
Is not the same.
01: 08: 22,440 -> 01: 08: 25,600
He does not say it is the same, but that ...
01: 08: 25,680 -> 01: 08: 28,720
We are both artists.
In fact, all three.
01: 08: 28,800 -> 01: 08: 31,080
No?
Your paintings are great.
01: 08: 31,160 -> 01: 08: 34,600
Come to the gallery.
It 's close.
01: 08: 34,680 -> 01: 08: 36,800
How long will you stay on Vis?
I do not know.
01: 08: 36,880 -> 01: 08: 39,080
We roam the islands.
01: 08: 39,160 -> 01: 08: 40,520
I do not know.
01: 08: 40,600 -> 01: 08: 43,200
But Vis likes me a lot!
This is the place.
01: 08: 43,280 -> 01: 08: 44,720
No, Barbie?
01: 08: 44,800 -> 01: 08: 47,160
Yes, of course, I do not know.
01: 08: 47,240 -> 01: 08: 49,520
We also wanted to see Korcula.
01: 08: 49,600 -> 01: 08: 52,400
Your father
and does Korcula buy vines?
01: 08: 52,480 -> 01: 08: 55,480
No. We are looking for a wedding venue.
01: 08: 55,560 -> 01: 08: 58,840
I wanted to be Hvar,
but Barbara showed me Vis and ...
01: 08: 58,920 -> 01: 09: 01,680
Wait a minute, but are women?
01: 09: 01,760 -> 01: 09: 03,200
Yes!
01: 09: 03,280 -> 01: 09: 06,000
Barbara, you got a good carp!
01: 09: 08,240 -> 01: 09: 11,480
Congratulations!
Thanks.
01: 09: 11,560 -> 01: 09: 14,800
Congratulations to you too.
For which?
01: 09: 14,880 -> 01: 09: 17,480
About Alan and Marina.
Was that what he called himself?
01: 09: 17,560 -> 01: 09: 19,680
Alan said they were also engaged.
01: 09: 20,880 -> 01: 09: 23,440
No, we ... I said ...
01: 09: 25,000 -> 01: 09: 27,280
Excuse me, I thought ...
01: 09: 27,360 -> 01: 09: 29,360
Was it a surprise?
01: 09: 31,280 -> 01: 09: 34,520
No, but ...
You did not share it. What's happening?
01: 09: 38,680 -> 01: 09: 40,160
Let's make a toast.
01: 09: 40,240 -> 01: 09: 42,760
Exactly. Cheers!
01: 09: 42,840 -> 01: 09: 44,800
Cheers.
"For Peter and Barbara.
01: 09: 44,880 -> 01: 09: 46,960
And for Alan and Marina.
01: 09: 47,040 -> 01: 09: 49,040
Right?
01: 09: 51,120 -> 01: 09: 55,360
Bruno, tell her,
The blue cave is not Vis?
01: 09: 55,440 -> 01: 09: 58,440
No, Bisshevo.
I told you?
01: 09: 58,520 -> 01: 10: 01,560
It's near, you have to ...
01: 10: 01,640 -> 01: 10: 05,200
Take a boat from Commie.
That's right, from Commie.
01: 10: 05,280 -> 01: 10: 07,280
You're my smarty, Barbie!
01: 10: 38,040 -> 01: 10: 43,240
The best terrain was given
for a cemetery in the Old Town.
01: 10: 44,280 -> 01: 10: 47,320
Try this specialty.
01: 10: 47,400 -> 01: 10: 51,320
Octopus on recipe
of a grandmother from Unicorn.
01: 10: 51,400 -> 01: 10: 53,720
As he eavesdrops the recipe,
it crazy me.
01: 10: 53,800 -> 01: 10: 55,640
Nothing against the woman,
01: 10: 55,720 -> 01: 10: 59,680
but without front teeth,
speaks to a dialect of a century ago ...
01: 11: 03,240 -> 01: 11: 05,800
Papake, will you play us something?
01: 11: 07,080 -> 01: 11: 09,080
Alan, your nose bleeds.
01: 11: 11,680 -> 01: 11: 14,960
And can a musical desire?
01: 11: 18,040 -> 01: 11: 20,160
Right now?
01: 11: 20,240 -> 01: 11: 22,680
Better to play a CD or radio.
01: 11: 22,760 -> 01: 11: 25,080
Peter has not heard you.
01: 11: 25,160 -> 01: 11: 27,560
Did not Barbara tell him
how does he play?
01: 11: 27,640 -> 01: 11: 29,680
Magnificently.
It is!
01: 11: 29,760 -> 01: 11: 33,000
Okay, but people are hungry ...
01: 11: 33,080 -> 01: 11: 35,760
It looks delicious.
It's wonderful.
01: 11: 35,840 -> 01: 11: 37,520
Are you going to sing us?
01: 11: 37,600 -> 01: 11: 39,080
Relax.
01: 11: 39,160 -> 01: 11: 41,800
I just want Peter to hear it.
01: 11: 45,560 -> 01: 11: 47,720
So be it, I'll be rolling.
01: 11: 47,800 -> 01: 11: 51,480
Come in, maestro.
Papa, if you have to ...
01: 11: 54,840 -> 01: 11: 58,320
Wait, I said,
that I have a musical desire?
01: 11: 59,800 -> 01: 12: 03,880
"Another Unfolds her Hair".
It's like that ...
01: 12: 07,840 -> 01: 12: 10,440
 As a dream she was, 01: 12: 10,520 -> 01: 12: 12,520
 as a roadside flower. 01: 12: 15,680 -> 01: 12: 18,320
 It was like the brightest day, 01: 12: 18,400 -> 01: 12: 20,560
 as a yellow rose. 01: 12: 23,160 -> 01: 12: 26,120
 But those happy days 01: 12: 26,200 -> 01: 12: 28,680
 They quickly disappeared. 01: 12: 31,280 -> 01: 12: 34,000
 I know never again 01: 12: 34,080 -> 01: 12: 36,560
 will not return. 01: 12: 39,000 -> 01: 12: 41,600
 Another man unravels her hair, 01: 12: 41,680 -> 01: 12: 43,960
 I love her. 01: 12: 46,840 -> 01: 12: 49,560
 How am I going to live alone? 01: 12: 49,640 -> 01: 12: 51,800
 My soul hurts. 01: 12: 54,480 -> 01: 12: 56,960
 Another took it away. 01: 12: 57,040 -> 01: 12: 59,280
 She took my delicate flower. 01: 13: 02,080 -> 01: 13: 07,240
 It does not care

01: 13: 09,080 -> 01: 13: 11,600
Well done!
01: 13: 11,640 -> 01: 13: 14,240
Forgive, do not we interrupt a party?
Do you work?
01: 13: 14,320 -> 01: 13: 17,040
No. This is a private party.
01: 13: 17,120 -> 01: 13: 21,560
No, no, it's open. Come in!
How are you, 007?
01: 13: 21,640 -> 01: 13: 23,680
Glad to see you.
01: 13: 23,760 -> 01: 13: 26,840
Sophie.
Allan. Your nose is better.
01: 13: 26,920 -> 01: 13: 29,320
Yes, it feels better.
01: 13: 29,400 -> 01: 13: 31,600
Come in.
No, we'll go elsewhere.
01: 13: 31,680 -> 01: 13: 34,320
No way.
Sit down with us.
01: 13: 34,400 -> 01: 13: 36,520
Anne?
All right.
01: 13: 36,600 -> 01: 13: 39,040
Hello.
01: 13: 39,920 -> 01: 13: 44,920
This is Ann. And this Sophie.
01: 13: 46,080 -> 01: 13: 48,760
And you are Alan's father, Bruno?
01: 13: 48,840 -> 01: 13: 50,400
Yes, but how do you know?
01: 13: 50,480 -> 01: 13: 53,280
We were in the gallery,
we saw your sails.
01: 13: 53,360 -> 01: 13: 57,400
They are magnificent!
Really? Thank you!
01: 13: 57,480 -> 01: 14: 00,520
But I'm not his father.
01: 14: 00,600 -> 01: 14: 03,040
I'm his younger brother.
01: 14: 04,840 -> 01: 14: 06,560
You have to try this.
01: 14: 06,640 -> 01: 14: 09,200
Papp, give two more plates.
01: 14: 09,280 -> 01: 14: 11,240
I will also bring an auxiliary table.
01: 14: 11,320 -> 01: 14: 15,440
This is Barbara, who marries.
01: 14: 15,520 -> 01: 14: 19,200
Hello.
"And that's Peter, her fiance.
01: 14: 20,480 -> 01: 14: 23,920
There are lots of money.
And a great boat.
01: 14: 25,400 -> 01: 14: 28,600
Do you have a boat?
Congratulations!
01: 14: 28,680 -> 01: 14: 31,240
Is it a festive celebration?
No.
01: 14: 31,320 -> 01: 14: 34,760
Yes! We celebrate.
Papp, give two more cups.
01: 14: 34,840 -> 01: 14: 37,960
Obligently try the wine -
unsurpassed!
01: 14: 39,440 -> 01: 14: 43,680
It's really good.
"Will you marry at Vis?"
01: 14: 43,760 -> 01: 14: 46,160
We think about it.
01: 14: 46,240 -> 01: 14: 48,520
The island is wonderful.
01: 14: 48,600 -> 01: 14: 52,360
I would marry him.
Does anyone know ...
01: 14: 58,520 -> 01: 15: 01,120
Try it.
Cheers!
01: 15: 02,000 -> 01: 15: 04,360
And where are you from?
Denmark.
01: 15: 09,960 -> 01: 15: 11,960
What would you say?
01: 15: 14,200 -> 01: 15: 17,840
Dark wine.
01: 15: 17,920 -> 01: 15: 21,760
Mysterious. There is one...
01: 15: 22,600 -> 01: 15: 24,560
A tantrum.
01: 15: 24,640 -> 01: 15: 27,200
No, nothing bitter!
Just a little bit.
01: 15: 27,280 -> 01: 15: 30,400
Leave it and come with me,
I'll show you something.
01: 15: 30,480 -> 01: 15: 33,680
This is Yabuka.
01: 15: 34,840 -> 01: 15: 37,880
The name means "apple".
Is it a real island?
01: 15: 37,960 -> 01: 15: 41,200
Yes, near Vis,
between Italy and Croatia.
01: 15: 41,280 -> 01: 15: 44,120
But Apple is not an island.
01: 15: 44,200 -> 01: 15: 46,480
In antiquity
only the most courageous fishermen,
01: 15: 46,560 -> 01: 15: 51,320
donated with curiosity to experience
the limits of human capabilities,
01: 15: 51,400 -> 01: 15: 55,160
have tasted the winter aroma
the black ...
01: 15: 56,200 -> 01: 15: 59,160
volcanic apple.
01: 16: 01,040 -> 01: 16: 03,400
Now, did you do it?
Naturally.
01: 16: 03,480 -> 01: 16: 05,800
Or is it the usual replica for download?
01: 16: 05,880 -> 01: 16: 09,560
No, now I figure it out!
I'm joking, I quote verse.
01: 18: 38,760 -> 01: 18: 40,120
 It's very slow. 01: 18: 40,200 -> 01: 18: 43,200
 Forget about my call,

01: 18: 57,400 -> 01: 19: 00,920
What's wrong?
Nothing.
01: 19: 02,720 -> 01: 19: 05,040
Wait.
01: 19: 05,120 -> 01: 19: 08,160
Did we do something last night?
01: 19: 11,760 -> 01: 19: 14,400
Do not you remember?
01: 19: 14,480 -> 01: 19: 17,200
We did. Almost ...
01: 19: 18,880 -> 01: 19: 20,880
I did not pick it up and ...
01: 19: 25,480 -> 01: 19: 27,960
Come on, let's get bigger.
01: 19: 28,040 -> 01: 19: 30,040
No do not.
01: 19: 31,400 -> 01: 19: 33,760
True, a woman is looking for you.
01: 19: 33,840 -> 01: 19: 36,000
I told her you were sleeping.
01: 19: 48,960 -> 01: 19: 51,680
Agent 007 has woken up! Hello!
01: 19: 53,240 -> 01: 19: 55,440
Hi, son, how are you?
01: 20: 02,240 -> 01: 20: 04,200
There is no scope here.
01: 20: 07,400 -> 01: 20: 09,680
Is there a Yabuka?
Yes.
01: 20: 10,920 -> 01: 20: 14,080
Last night he made a big show, Alan.
01: 20: 14,920 -> 01: 20: 17,480
Very sorry!
01: 20: 17,560 -> 01: 20: 20,120
Return us to Vis.
You're not the boss.
01: 20: 20,200 -> 01: 20: 22,280
What's wrong with you?
Where are we going?
01: 20: 22,360 -> 01: 20: 24,400
Apple, you suggested.
01: 20: 24,480 -> 01: 20: 26,280
What happened?
01: 20: 26,360 -> 01: 20: 30,440
Why did you pick it up ?!
What does it catch you?
01: 20: 30,520 -> 01: 20: 33,160
Where are we?
Fuck you!
01: 20: 33,240 -> 01: 20: 36,360
Allan, calm down.
Fuck you! You too.
01: 20: 36,440 -> 01: 20: 38,440
Fuck you!
01: 21: 09,200 -> 01: 21: 12,200
Do you have a phone?
"Where is it?"
01: 21: 13,240 -> 01: 21: 15,840
He fell into the sea. Do you have?
01: 21: 15,920 -> 01: 21: 19,600
Yes. But the battery is probably at zero.
01: 21: 21,920 -> 01: 21: 23,920
Low signal.
01: 21: 27,440 -> 01: 21: 30,360
Please go upstairs,
may be stronger.
01: 21: 31,400 -> 01: 21: 34,520
I can not hurt my leg.
Again?
01: 21: 34,600 -> 01: 21: 37,400
I am confused -
when does it hurt, when does it stop?
01: 21: 37,480 -> 01: 21: 40,840
I hurt because yesterday I fell
from the stupid wheel.
01: 21: 40,920 -> 01: 21: 44,320
Where's the bike?
I do not know. I dropped it somewhere.
01: 21: 44,400 -> 01: 21: 47,240
You tossed my wheel?
"Forget it now.
01: 21: 47,320 -> 01: 21: 49,840
Climb up
and called for help.
01: 21: 49,920 -> 01: 21: 51,920
His mommy ...
01: 21: 52,920 -> 01: 21: 54,920
Damn it.
01: 22: 16,320 -> 01: 22: 19,200
Loves only an Italian operator.
01: 22: 20,160 -> 01: 22: 21,680
Well, what?
01: 22: 21,760 -> 01: 22: 26,000
How to call the Italian police
on a Croatian Island?
01: 22: 30,080 -> 01: 22: 32,840
I do not know. Call Papa.
01: 22: 32,920 -> 01: 22: 35,400
I do not wear the notebook.
Do you know his number?
01: 22: 35,480 -> 01: 22: 39,160
No. What kind of notebook?
With the numbers.
01: 22: 39,240 -> 01: 22: 41,720
Are not you in your phone?
No.
01: 22: 41,800 -> 01: 22: 44,920
It's complicated.
That's why I'm writing in a notebook.
01: 22: 45,000 -> 01: 22: 47,880
Tricky ?! I have no words.
01: 22: 49,240 -> 01: 22: 53,480
Do you know a number?
No, they're in the cell phone.
01: 22: 54,560 -> 01: 22: 56,680
Why do you make it to me?
01: 23: 07,120 -> 01: 23: 09,040
I know a number by heart.
01: 23: 09,120 -> 01: 23: 11,560
Moment.
01: 23: 11,640 -> 01: 23: 13,640
Well, how do you rip now.
01: 23: 16,000 -> 01: 23: 18,000
Dumb Notebooks.
01: 23: 34,800 -> 01: 23: 37,480
Hi, Hartz?
 Hi, wait a minute. 01: 23: 37,560 -> 01: 23: 39,360
Listen...
 I'll call later. 01: 23: 39,440 -> 01: 23: 41,160
For another I'm looking for you!
 Excuse me. 01: 23: 41,240 -> 01: 23: 44,960
Listen!
 Play an essay how much you need. 01: 23: 45,040 -> 01: 23: 47,040
 Bye! No, Hartz, listen to me ...
01: 23: 53,880 -> 01: 23: 55,640
I called a friend.
01: 23: 55,720 -> 01: 23: 57,720
It will not happen.
01: 24: 04,560 -> 01: 24: 07,840
Do you understand,
that no one knows where we are?
01: 24: 07,920 -> 01: 24: 10,360
And am I again guilty?
01: 24: 10,440 -> 01: 24: 14,440
As she knocked the Danish, she was
he said we were at a funeral.
01: 24: 14,520 -> 01: 24: 17,880
I got on the boat for you!
01: 24: 17,960 -> 01: 24: 22,000
Yes, I stretched it, it is true.
But I was worried about you.
01: 24: 22,080 -> 01: 24: 24,080
Did she fuck her, worried about me?
01: 24: 24,160 -> 01: 24: 26,880
Yes. My son is a junkie,
dependent on cocaine.
01: 24: 26,960 -> 01: 24: 28,800
What a junkie, what cocaine!
01: 24: 28,880 -> 01: 24: 32,040
Do not make me a dude. I'm not!
01: 24: 32,120 -> 01: 24: 34,560
I know everyone is snorting.
But it is dangerous.
01: 24: 34,640 -> 01: 24: 37,080
And you snap and clog every day.
01: 24: 37,160 -> 01: 24: 39,760
The grass is different from cocaine!
01: 24: 41,040 -> 01: 24: 44,240
I really worry about you.
I `m not joking.
01: 24: 46,240 -> 01: 24: 48,240
You worry about me, huh?
01: 24: 49,440 -> 01: 24: 51,440
Super.
01: 24: 52,680 -> 01: 24: 54,680
You thought in a timely manner.
01: 24: 56,480 -> 01: 24: 58,480
Do you know me at all?
01: 24: 59,640 -> 01: 25: 03,040
If you worried, you would ask
why home is a hog,
01: 25: 03,120 -> 01: 25: 05,280
why is my mutter broken,
01: 25: 05,360 -> 01: 25: 09,200
why from 15 years old
is dragging on psychiatrists.
01: 25: 14,520 -> 01: 25: 16,520
Was he worried about me then?
01: 25: 18,160 -> 01: 25: 20,160
Then I needed a father.
01: 25: 22,040 -> 01: 25: 24,040
Then I cried for you.
01: 25: 31,120 -> 01: 25: 35,680
If you cared, you would ask
mother why come with you.
01: 25: 35,760 -> 01: 25: 39,920
You would have known that Marina had left me
and I had a nervous crisis.
01: 26: 09,120 -> 01: 26: 11,120
I know another number.
01: 28: 29,040 -> 01: 28: 31,040
I'll change my clothes.
01: 29: 51,360 -> 01: 29: 53,360
Do you love Peter?
01: 29: 54,920 -> 01: 29: 59,320
Of course.
Otherwise, I would not marry him.
01: 30: 00,200 -> 01: 30: 02,480
It is very good.
01: 30: 02,560 -> 01: 30: 06,360
We can not scramble.
I'm pissed, and he gags me:
01: 30: 06,440 -> 01: 30: 08,160
"Do not, dear."
01: 30: 08,240 -> 01: 30: 10,600
And in the morning flowers.
01: 30: 11,840 -> 01: 30: 14,920
He is...
Too ideal even.
01: 30: 18,480 -> 01: 30: 20,480
Marina left me.
01: 30: 23,000 -> 01: 30: 24,680
Why?
01: 30: 24,760 -> 01: 30: 27,080
Well ...
01: 30: 27,160 -> 01: 30: 29,160
You know best.
01: 30: 35,880 -> 01: 30: 37,880
Why did you sleep with me?
01: 30: 39,200 -> 01: 30: 41,680
Because that's us.
01: 30: 41,760 -> 01: 30: 44,360
And that's my thing.
01: 30: 44,440 -> 01: 30: 47,560
I knock, I drink.
01: 30: 48,400 -> 01: 30: 50,880
And I'm getting drunk.
On weekends.
01: 30: 56,040 -> 01: 30: 58,040
Sometimes I do a design.
01: 31: 25,640 -> 01: 31: 28,880
I could not find anything else.
You look decent.
01: 31: 43,480 -> 01: 31: 45,480
Stop with this.
01: 31: 47,240 -> 01: 31: 49,240
Look me in the eyes.
01: 31: 51,840 -> 01: 31: 55,320
Say: "I really love her."
01: 31: 55,400 -> 01: 31: 57,400
Can you say that?
01: 32: 06,640 -> 01: 32: 08,480
I can not.
01: 32: 08,560 -> 01: 32: 10,640
And why did you have a nervous breakdown?
01: 32: 19,280 -> 01: 32: 21,280
From fear.
01: 32: 27,200 -> 01: 32: 29,200
That I will become like you.
01: 32: 40,040 -> 01: 32: 42,040
You know?
01: 32: 49,240 -> 01: 32: 54,320
This is our rapprochement
I find it strange.
01: 32: 54,400 -> 01: 32: 56,760
And why did he move my phone into the sea?
01: 32: 58,560 -> 01: 33: 00,560
Excuse me.
01: 33: 02,240 -> 01: 33: 04,840
My excitement came in more than anything.
01: 33: 14,240 -> 01: 33: 16,240
Are we going?
01: 33: 18,120 -> 01: 33: 21,560
How's your foot?
Like New.
01: 34: 20,200 -> 01: 34: 22,200
My condolences.
01: 34: 36,760 -> 01: 34: 38,760
My condolences.
01: 34: 51,200 -> 01: 34: 53,920
Alan?
01: 34: 54,000 -> 01: 34: 56,000
Is this a "comic sanss"?
01: 34: 56,880 -> 01: 34: 59,000
Please?
01: 34: 59,080 -> 01: 35: 01,920
The tombstone.
Is "comic sanse"?
01: 35: 08,640 -> 01: 35: 10,640
Yes.
01: 35: 45,860 -> 01: 35: 49,860
