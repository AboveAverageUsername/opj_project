Zašto trpimo ovu prokletu klimu?
Mislim, vidi nas.
Džeri ne može da govori.[br]Uh?
Lesli ne èuje.[br]Šta?
Margo ima lice kao crvena kaša.[br]Uæuti!
Majka izgleda kao irska pralja.[br]Ne izgledam.
Avgust je! Treba nam sunce.
Da, dragi.
Imam prijatelja, živi u Grèkoj, na Krfu.
Kaže da je predivno.[br]Zašto se ne spakujemo i odemo?
Ne mogu tek tako da odem. Imamo kuæu ovde.
Prodaæemo je.[br]Ne budi smešan, Lorense.
Džeri treba da se obrazuje.[br]Ne, biæu u redu.
Ne možemo samo da se pokupimo i odemo.[br]To bi bilo ludilo.
Ovo je prièa o vremenu koje sam proveo na Krfu.
U poèetku je to trebalo da bude[br]blago nostalgièan opis
prirodne istorije ostrva,
ali sam napravio strašnu grešku[br]ubacivši u prièu svoju porodicu,
koja je polako preuzela.
Samo uz velike teškoæe[br]i koristeæi prilièno lukavstvo,
sam uspeo da saèuvem malo prostora[br]iskljuèivo za životinje.
Šta je ovo?[br]Larve.
Uskoro æe da postanu bube.
Vidi se po tome što im[br]koža postaje tamnija.
On?[br]Rodžer.
Jako je važno imati psa.[br]
Ja sam pisac.
Ta je prilièno dobra.[br]Proziva razna buržoaska sranja.
Dobro.
Ovo, ne.
To je posteljina.
Roba. Porez.
To je naša posteljina! Smešni èoveèe.
Hajde majko. Izbegavajmo[br]iritantne ljude što je duže moguæe.
Da nije neki praznik?
Nisam baš ovakav doèek oèekivao.
Hajde. Joj! Joj!
Zašto neko nešto ne uradi?
Upomoæ!
Odlazi!
Oèi! Oèi!
Sklonite ih![br]Džeralde, sad.
Pa, svi deluju vrlo pristojno.
Nisu hteli da mi daju toalet-papir.[br]Pst. Nemoj za stolom.
Nisi pogledao dobro.[br]Imaš celu kutiju pored lavaboa.
Margo, dušo.[br]Šta?
Kutija je za papir koji je korišæen.
Ne može da proðe kroz ovdašnju kanalizaciju.
Ugh. Ne.
Koristila sam...
Da. Malo je nehigijenski.
Podseti me da potražim tifusnu groznicu[br]u knjizi na recepciji.
Vrlo emotivne godine.[br]
Mogla bih da pošaljem sredstvo za dezinfekciju[br]u njenu sobu.
Evo ih.
Sigurna sam da imam tifusnu groznicu.
Oseæam se tako...
tifusno.[br]Žao mi je,
ali pokazali ste nam 10 kuæa[br]i nijedna nema kupatilo.
Oh, ne opet.[br]Kupatilo? Šta æe vam kupatilo?
Imate more.
Ali ovo je kolevka civilizacije.[br]Moraju imati kupatila.
Sami æemo naæi mesto.
Er...
Oh. Erm, er...
Taxi.
Mi ne govorimo grèki.
Planiramo da nauèimo.
Ooh. Ow.
Zašto ne uèiniš nešto, Leri?
Šta? Oni se samo ponašaju kao Grci.
Oi!
Treba vam neko ko govori vaš jezik?
Ovi vam dosaðuju?
Ne, ne.[br]Hej!
Dakle, taxi?
Gde hoces idete?
A?
Znas sta? Englezi uvek hoce kupatila.
Imam kupatilo u moja kuca.
Osam godina sam bio u Èikago.
Onda kazem, ''Spiro, zaradio si[br]dovoljno novac.'' I onda se vratim, a?
Donesem ovaj auto sa sobom.
Najbolje auto na ostrvu.
Ne lazem ni rec.
Gledajte gde vozite.
Svi engleski turista traze mene[br]kad doðu na ostrvo.
Da. Znas, erm...
da nisam Grcki...
da, voleo bih da sam Engleski.
Evo. Vila sa kupatila.
Izgledalo je kao da je vila stajala tamo[br]i èekala da stignemo.
Oseæali smo se kao da smo došli kuæi.
Uzeæemo je.
Džeri, da li bi mogao...
Jednom kad je Spiro preuzeo brigu,
zakaèio se za nas kao pijavica[br]i postao deo porodice.
Kao veliki, smeði, ružni anðeo,
nežno je brinuo o nama.
Ah, Lesli, æao. Veliki momak.
Gospo]o Darels. Imate sve?
Gde su stvari od ovih ljudi?[br]One su roba.
Dosli smo da ih uzmemo.[br]Hajde, donesi ih.
Carinski prokletnici, a? Sve ih znam.[br]Hej! Zasto ih otvorio, kuckin sine?
To mi je posao.[br]Posao, a?
Tretiras postene strance kao krijumcare, a?
To ti posao?
Prokletnici misle da poseduju ovo mesto.
Hajde!
Ali, izgledas kao on. Izgledas kao on.
Džeri, ne èaèkaj koleno.[br]Hajde, Jedi svoj kounoupidi.
Hoæeš li da trkneš do moje sobe[br]i doneseš mi cigarete?
Donesi ih sam.[br]To je problem sa ovom porodicom.
Nema solidarnosti, nema obzira prema drugima.[br]Ti nemaš mnogo obzira prema drugima.
Majko, nije trebalo da nas vaspitaš[br]da budemo tako sebièni.
Nikad nisam tako nešto uradila.
Nismo postali sebièni bez ikakvih uputstava.
Hej. Trebalo bi da pazis sta pricas.
Ne zelis da povredis majku.[br]Zašto? Ona nikad ništa nije uradila za nas.
Nemoj da se salis... Nemoj cak ni da se salis na taj nacin.[br]Sasvim je u pravu.
Ona uopšte nije naroèito dobra kao majka.[br]Ne govori to. Ne govori to!
Boga mi, da ja imam ovakvu majku,
ljubio bih joj stope svako jutro do smrti.
Dakle, nastanili smo se u vili,
i svako od nas se smestio[br]i prilagodio okruženju,
na svoj naèin.
Da bih objasnio neka od naših èudnih ponašanja,
oseæam da bi trebalo da naglasim[br]da smo u vreme boravka na Krfu,
svi u porodici bili prilièno mladi.
Osim majke, èije godine nikad nismo znali,
iz prostog razloga[br]jer nije mogla da se seti kad je roðena.
Oh.
Ko je parkirao ovog magarca ovde?
Zašto ga ne pomeriš ako ti smeta, dušo?
Buduæe generacije[br]ne bi trebalo da budu lišene mog rada
zato što sam bio napolju rasterujuæi magarce.[br]Probaj ovo.
Prokletstvo. Šta je to?
Melitzana horiatiki.[br]Zar cornflakes nije stigao?
Leri, dušo,[br]došli smo da probamo nove stvari.
Našao sam pauka krabu.
Ako ga staviš na list druge boje,
promeni boju ako saèekaš dovoljno dugo.
Zašto nosi te èizme[br]po ovoj vruæini?
Zmije.[br]
A džemper?[br]Da ga ne izgubimo.
Vidi, ovo je velika porodica,
ne bi joj škodilo malo proreðivanja.[br]
Za ime Boga!
Mm.[br]Mm.
Hoæe li Lesli to raditi ceo dan?
To mu je hobi, svima nam treba neki hobi.[br]Nije mnogo dobar u drugim stvarima.
O, da, da, svima nam treba hobi.
Uæuti!
Nisam sigurna da je sunèanje u tome[br]pametno.
Taj...kostim ne pokriva mnogo.
Ne budi tako staromodna.
Samo se jednom umire.
Znaš one crne gusenice[br]što sam mislio da su gusenice?
Nisu. To su bubamare koje su se tek izlegle.
Ali izgledaju isto kao gusenice.[br]Hm?
Da!
I one muve o kojima sam ti prièao...
Da?[br]One legu jaja u cveæu,
da bi... Isprièaæu ti kasnije.
Gde ideš?[br]Da istražujem.
Lepo se provedi.
Zna li mama?
Idem da istražujem!
U tim ranim danima istraživanja,[br]Rodžer je bio savršen saputnik za avanturu,
Privržen bez preterivanja,[br]hrabar ali ne i ratoboran,
inteligentan i pun razumevanja[br]za moje nastranosti.
Izvinite.
Znate li kako se piše ''Oprez''?
I ''Tišina''?
Nagaðaæu.
Oh, um...
Ah.
Hvala.[br]
Još se nisu izlegli, Rodžere.
U redu, ali to je to.
Nema više kuænih ljubimaca.
Kakve su mi pege, majko?[br]Fine, dušo, jako si lepa.
Mm, jako tašta.[br]Mamin sin.
Nisam! Zar ne, mama?
To je Ahilova omiljena hrana.
Džeri.
Možeš da skineš džemper.
Izgleda kao loše skuvano pile.
Oh, a jedan od Marginih...
obožavaoca je doneo ovo.
To je stajalo tamo sa razlogom.
Svejedno, pisanje ti je užasno.[br]Treba ti neka vrsta obrazovanja.
Ne! Ne, ne treba.[br]Da, mora da nauèi da pleše.
Ili æe postati jedan od[br]onih odvratnih smetenjaka.
Treba mu dobra osnova u književnosti.
Predlažem Rabelea.[br]Prestar je za Džerija, mislim.
Važno je da shvati seks[br]na pravi naèin.
Ti si opsednut seksom,[br]u sve ga uvlaèiš.
Zdrav život u prirodi je sve što mu treba.[br]Pusanje i plovidba.
Prièaš kao prokleti biskup.
Tako si tvrdoglav![br]Uæuti.
Deco, prestanite.[br]Vidite, treba nam neko ko æe da poduèava Džerija,
ali i podržavati njegovo interesovanje za divljinu.[br]Zašto? To je samo faza kroz koju prolazi.
Faza koja traje od njegove druge godine.[br]Zašto uvek prièate o meni
kao da nisam tu?[br]Moj prijatelj Džordž je još uvek ovde.
On bi mogao da proba da ga poduèava.[br]To je dobra ideja.
Mm-hm.
Um...
Možete li da ponovite pitanje? Još jednom.
Koliko dugo bi šestorica ljudi pravila zid
ako ga njih trojica prave nedelju dana?
Er...
Erm...
U redu. Um...
Ako dva crva
za nedelju dana pojedu osam listova,
koliko dugo bi èetiri crva[br]jela isti broj listova?
Kojih crva?
Bilo kojih!
On jednostavno ne želi da uèi.
Pa, naravno da ne želi, Džordže. Ima 12 godina.
I živi u onome što je za njega[br]ogromna prodavnica slatkiša.
Majko, ima li negde èistog veša?
Er...
Malo glasnije, Margo, dušo,[br]mislim da te nisu èuli u Makedoniji.
Možda bi trebalo da zatvoriš usta[br]pre nego što neki insekt uleti unutra.
Bože, baš si se zacrveneo.[br]Mogli bismo da ispeèemo pogaèu na tebi.
Ah, a-ali... Ona je, um... jako upeèatljiva.
Da. Verovatno je trebalo njoj da[br]navuèem onaj džemper, a ne Džeraldu.
A kad ga veæ pominjem, mislim da je rešenje[br]iskoristiti njegove prednosti, zar ne?
Pa, probao sam.
Znate, koliko je šest kakadua[br]puta sedam kakadua i te stvari.
42 kakadua.
Erm...da.
Oh.
Pa, u svakom sluèaju, erm...hajde da, erm,[br]popustimo još malo, hoæemo li?
I izvedite ganapolje.[br]Nije prirodno da bude unutra.
Kopile!
Kao što vidiš.
Dobro je.
I er, da ne zaboravimo istoriju.
Er, navedi imena Hanibalovih slonova[br]kojima je prešao Alpe.
Bardi.[br]Dobro.
Jespa.
Amito.
Surus.
Domito...
Sextus.
Titus.
Rašljar.
I, današnje lekcije su gotove.
Oèigledno.
Rašljar se pojavljivao relativno èesto
sa novim dodacima mojoj menažeriji.
Žabom, na primer,[br]ili belim golubom sa slomljenom nogom.
Èajni kolutiæ?
Ah.
Mmm.
Ovo je uzbudljiv deo.
Ometen nevoljnim uèenikom,
Džordž se trudio da uèini moje lekcije[br]što je moguæe zanimljivijim.
Dakle, Francuska i Britanska flota[br]su se polako približavale jedna drugoj,
i spremale se za odluèujuæu pomorsku bitku u ratu.
Morski puževi!
Video sam ih u knjizi.
Dobro. Kad je spazio neprijatelja, Nelson je...
Ah![br]
Dobro. Nelson je bio na mostu...
posmatrajuæi ptice svojim teleskopom...
..i pošto ga je o primicanju neprijatelja obavestio[br]prijateljski nastrojeni galebl.
Ne. Nemoj da me pitaš koja vrsta galeba.
Teo.
Hajde.[br]On je uvrnuti ljubitelj prirode kao i ti.
I ekspert za praktièno sve.
Džerald Darel. Dr Teodor Stefanides.
Oh, jako mi je drago da te upoznam.[br]Oh, i Vas.
Ooh! Izvinite.
Zanimljivo.
Morski puž.
# Greensleeves was all my joy
# Greensleeves...
To je stvarno poslednji ljubimac kojeg dobija.
# Greensleeves was my heart of gold
# And who but my lady Greensleeves #
To je bilo za pamæenje.[br]Hvala.
Sviða mi se ovde.
Hoæu da budem sahranjena na Krfu.
Možemo li to sutra?[br]Malo je prohladno napolju.
Pod najveæim èempresom u dvorištu.
Rekla si iza Jani, èobaninove kuæe.
Da. Ali mislim da je to malo[br]nepristupaèno.
Ne želim da ožalošæeni padaju kao muve[br]na pola puta uz brdo.
Zdravo, Spiro. Spiro.
Jesi dobro?
Ne.
Gospoðica Margo je u pitanju.
Šta s njom?
Ona...
Ona ima deèka Turcina.
Šta fali tome? Osim što je Džordž[br]hteo da krene u akciju.
Šteta, Džordži.[br]Šta nije u redu?
Gospoðica Margo sa kopiletom,[br]kuèkinim sinom Turèinom.
Plivaju zajedno.
Je l trudna?[br]
Izvinite.[br]Sigurno æe biti u redu.
Pozvaæemo ga na èaj.
Èaj?
Džeralde, imam poklon za tebe od Dr Tea.
Ko je on, dušo?[br]On je Džordžov prijatelj.
On sve zna.
Jedina osoba koju sam do sad sreo
koja je izgledala da deli moj entuzijazam[br]za zoologiju bio je Teo.
Bio sam jako polaskan[br]što je nauènik priliènog ugleda -
a ovo sam znao po njegovoj bradi -
razgovarao sa mnom kao[br]da znam isto koliko i on.
Ovo je pauk kiklop viridis,
kojeg, erm...[br]kojeg sam uhvatio blizu Govina pre neki dan.
Jedno oko na sred njegove glave!
Neverovatno, zar ne? Zato kiklop.
Kiklop.
Èekaj. Imam predivnu knjigu[br]o Grèkoj mitologiji ovde negde.
Um...
Kupio sam neke insekte.
Pitam se znate li šta su.
Džeri, mislim da æemo se jako lepo slagati.
Oh. Sad, ovo je... Huu.
Ove je jako teško uhvatiti.
Dakle, sad...
Trudnoæa.
Razmišljala sam da prièamo o ovome[br]jer je to...
važna tema i veoma...
divna.
I...
prilièno...
zbunjujuæa.
I èak...
šokantna.
Šta?
Znam sve o tome. Stalno gledam životinje[br]kako se pare i poraðaju se.
Pa, izgledalo mi je malo èudno.
Ovde je kao na porodiljskom odeljenju,[br]mislila sam da moraš znati šta se dešava.
Da, znam.[br]Odlièno.
Mogu li sad da idem?[br]Ne, jer...
mi ljudi smo drugaèiji od životinja.
Mi...
Er, pa, možda...mi previše razmišljamo.
I, erm...
I otkriæeš da je ponekad život,
tvoj život takoðe,
bolan.
Naroèito kad je reè...
o ljubavi.
Pa, pogledaj Džordža. Toliko je razoèaran[br]zbog Margo da je otišao nazad u Englesku.
Zašto nije potražio nekog drugog ovde?
Pa, zato što se oseæa...
beznadežno i...
usamljeno i...treba mu njegova porodica...
Neki jako doteran èovek[br]dolazi stazom.
Bože.
zar veæ?
Stigao je.
Margo nam je prièala toliko o Vama.
Volimo Margo.
Uzmite kolaè.
Vi pišete, zar ne.[br]Da, ja, er...
Uvek oseæam da bih mogao fantastièno da pišem kad bih probao.
Stvarno? Pa, to je dar, zar ne?
On odlièno pliva. Ide jako daleko od obale.
Možda bi voleo da nam pokaže.
Ja sam odlièan plivaè.
Ne znam za strah.
Kada jašem konja,[br]ne oseæam strah jer jašem savršeno.
Mogu da plovim brodom kroz oluju.
Bez straha.
Vidite,
ja nisam plašljiv èovek.
Volela bih kad ne bi stavljao toliko parfema.
Ahil...
Upao je u bunar.
Mislim da je mrtav.[br]Oh.
On je kornjaèa.
Ah.
Šta su one?
Rakljaèe.
Predivno.
Ponekad znam zašto[br]više voliš životinje nego ljude.
Zašto te toliko zanimaju?
One su kao mi, zar ne?
Porodice.
Hoæu da znam kako funkcionišu.
Zamisli da nisu tamo.
Mora li da ih drži na konèiæima?[br]Bolje nego u kutiji.
Hajde da ih kupimo sve.
Danima, vila je bila puna rakljaèa,
koje su nam, kao smaragdi, padale u krila.
Pozvao sam par ljudi[br]na nedelju dana.
Oh, that will be nice.[br]Yeah.
It will be good to have[br]some intelligent and stimulating company.
Oh, I hope they're not too highbrow.[br]Of course they're not. They are charming.
Like me.
Little English lord.
Why do they think we are lords and ladies?[br]Because we act like it.
Tell the Pension Suisse your friends are coming.
No, no. I invited them to stay with us.
How can they possibly stay with us?[br]There's plenty of room.
If Margo and Les sleep on the balcony.[br]What?
That gives you two rooms.[br]You have to write and put them off.
I can't. They're on their way.
Oh, really, you are so thoughtless.[br]Where are they going to sleep?
We'll move into a bigger villa.
We can't afford it. Are you simple?
It's important to live beyond your means,[br]or banks don't respect you.
How many people have you really invited?[br]Eight.
To...twelve.
Well, we are not moving to another villa.
Mother went about settling us in again.
Our neat little house in Bournemouth[br]seemed several lifetimes away.
Inside of...
Ah, Mrs Durrells. This is Lugaretzia.
She, er, she comes with the house.
She has a bad stomach.
Very odd.[br]Well, I'll just...
Oh.
I'm going to kill her.
Put her out of her misery.
Poor woman. She's obviously suffering. What's the matter?
Digestion. She gets these nasty...[br]Don't tell us.
It's her feet now, apparently. Don't say anything,[br]there's no one else available.
Yummy, yummy.
I told you it was a good idea to move.
The furniture could be[br]a little more sturdy, perhaps.
Did I ever tell you about the last opera[br]we had in Corfu?
Er, no.
Oh.
Yes, it was one of those[br]travelling opera companies performing Tosca
with a leading lady who was very, er...
well developed.
Now, in the final act, as you probably know,[br]she throws herself to her death
from the battlements of a castle.
Well, on the first night,
it seems the stagehands had forgotten[br]to put anything for her to land on,
so she fell with a huge crash,
and then proceeded groaning quite loudly,
while her lover was singing about[br]how sad he was that she was dead.
Oh.[br]Shall we help him back on?
No, I think that might put him off.[br]
The lady was, er, very, very upset,[br]understandably,
so the next night, the stagehands made sure
that they put a huge pile of mattresses[br]for her to land on.
But her landing was now so soft and springy,
that when the whole cast was singing away[br]about her tragic death,
she, the lady in question, reappeared,
two or three times above the battlements.
Do you make these up?[br]No.
Nothing ever goes according to plan in Corfu.[br]
Larry's friends.
I think Mother's a bit worried about them.[br]Why?
Not bad, eh? Bleeding enormous.
A little bit quicker with that.
When is lunch?
Yes, it won't be long.
Oh!
Look. A tortoise.
I watched it hatching.[br]Oh, another tortoise. Splendid.
Please go and find Larry.[br]His friends are driving me mad.
Larry!
After weeks of searching,[br]I I found the perfect trees covered...
in exquisite blossom.
I started to paint...
a masterpiece.
When I returned the next day...
I found all the blossom had fallen to the ground.
That's the wind for you.[br]I swore I'd never paint again.
But slowly...
I am recovering my nerves.
And...
And sometime...
I will start to paint again.
Larry!
Out you go, kid. I'm working.
Hommm.
Hommm.
Far from being the ordinary, charming people[br]that Larry had promised,
his friends turned out to be[br]the most extraordinary eccentrics.
It was like observing a whole new species.
Ha, ha.
Larry's too busy mating with Nancy.
Of course there's going to be a war.
That's what dictators do when they're bored[br]with oppressing their own people.
Is Hitler a dictator? I thought he was a painter.
So he can't be all bad.
Painter and decorator.[br]Oh.
Europe is a like a big, fat marrow,
lying in the sun, panting to explode.
Do you bloody poets not make sense[br]on purpose? I mean, what was that?
At least the Italian fascists[br]are spending their money on nice uniforms.
Germany's become a bomb-making factory.
No, that's just to give everybody[br]something to do. It's all about business.
You know nothing. You're Humpty Dumpty.
Ah. Humpty Dumpty. Now thank you.
At last, real poetry. Simple, free of clichés,[br]you could learn from it.
Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall
Now, I mean, that could clearly be about Hitler.
Humpty as Hitler? I don't think that's right.
I think the more accurate analogy[br]there might be some... Hickory Dickory Dock.
Well, if you're going to do mice...[br]Come on, Larry.
It's not like you not to have an opinion.
No, it's not.
We're cut off from the world here.
I suppose we've grown rather fond of[br]our glorious isolation.
Actually, Larry thinks[br]the world's cut off from him,
rather than the other way round.[br]I do now you mention it. Yes, I do.
Fine. But you may wake up and find[br]there's no England to go back to.
Oh, I'm... I'm sure common sense will prevail.
Why? It never does in this family.
You'll find that Hickory Dickory Dock
is the mouse is going up the clock,[br]that's us being...
The mouse being England, used to be...[br]Could you just spit it out?
..now reduced to little mouse.
Tricking its way up the top[br]and that's us being chased.
Oh, God! It's her asthma.
She's allergic to cats.[br]That's the only animal we haven't got.
I'll open the windows.
Please, don't don't open the window.[br]I'm allergic to fresh air.
Could it be bats?[br]I think we've got some of those.
How could it be bats?[br]I don't know.
Just breathe. God.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Just breathe.
Gerry, you're starting to look like a wild animal.
Thanks.
Have you ever stuffed a bat?
No.
It's harder than it looks.
If this works, I'm going to do Larry.
Isn't it enough just to look at them in the wild?
I like having them around me,
making noises,
smelling.
You're right. It's just like a family.
Did you hear the others talking about[br]what's happening in Germany?
Yes.
It seems so safe here.
No, barn owl! Barn owl, no!
No!
Morning.[br]Morning.
What's he doing?[br]The usual.
He was doing it at 2am[br]this morning with a torch.
He says the day shift[br]is totally unlike the night shift.
Just to warn you, the wild and the woolly[br]are stirring indoors,
and I don't mean Gerry's animals.
Larry, you might encourage your friend Mr Miller[br]to experiment with pyjamas.
Henry sees clothes[br]as the last refuge of the bourgeoisie.
Watch this. Three, two...
Good.
Perhaps it's just as well your father didn't live[br]to see how you all turned out.
How extraordinarily insensitive of you.[br]I think you nagged him to death.
We're actually rather well adjusted.
Well, I am.
Oh.
I think I may have over-celebrated[br]the god of wine last night.
Erm...
Larry.
Don't move.
Bloody hell![br]
What are you doing?
It's that boy.[br]Every matchbox in this house is a deathtrap.
Mother, they're coming. Quick, do something!
How did those scorpions get on the table?[br]No, no!
Margo, where are they?
Put the chair down, Leslie.[br]Hit them with a book.
No! No!
No!
Hit them with a book!
Scorpions won't hurt you[br]unless you're clumsy with them.
They kill people, you idiot. They sting you,[br]it's excruciating, and then you die.
What on earth is going on?
Oh, my God, it's scorpions.
Oh, God.
Breathe slowly.[br]Don't have an attack.
I got a nosebleed.[br]It feels like I've got a nosebleed.
Gerry. Look, it's fine.
No! No, he's out of control.[br]He's driven my friends away.
I know. That's such a shame.
Well, what should I do?
Post him back to England in a big package[br]with his head sticking out?
Don't be ridiculous.[br]Don't tell me what to be.
You're my child, not my husband.
You are not driving this...[br]slightly ramshackle vehicle.
You're in the back, being driven.
Eating chocolates.
Well, I think it's about to crash.
Well, we'll see, shall we?
Gerald.
This is Peter.
Hello, Gerald.[br]Hello.
All right, thank you, Mrs Durrell.[br]I'm sure Gerald and I will be just fine.
Right.
Good.
Let me tell you something about me.
I believe in the building blocks of education.
There are no short cuts, there is only repetition,[br]rule learning and hard work.
Let's start with some basic...
mathematics.
Page one, number one.
When you've done that, move on to page 83,[br]work through those.
Hello, I'm Margo.
What a pleasant surprise.
I'd offer to teach you too, only you look like[br]you know everything already.
Can I have a biscuit?[br]No.
Do call out if you need anything.[br]I might just do that.
I say.
She loves being in the garden.
Does she?[br]Mm.
Chatting.
Shall I write a story?
A long story?
Good idea.
''Larry wrestled with the jaguar,
''the animal's incisors...
''inches from the tall, fleshy man's[br]soft, girlish skin.
''Larry glanced over to desperately see
''his brother Gerald having rather more success[br]tackling the massive boa constrictor
''wrapped round his mother's waist[br]like a rope of iron.
''He tore at the creature with a knife,[br]careful not to hurt it.
''Gerald finally sent the constrictor packing,[br]then turned to his older brother,
''who was whimpering with fear,[br]cornered by the jaguar.''
Gerry, your stuffed bat smells even worse[br]than everything else, if that were possible.
Please get rid of it.
Where's Peter?[br]He set me some work.
I'm working very hard.
I think he might be somewhere with Margo.
You can see that this essentially loamy soil
gives way...
..gives way further up the scarp,[br]to a more clay strata
with the characteristic alluvium.[br]Mm-hm.
There are publications on the subject[br]if you're interested.
Baldwin's Dictionary Of Soil[br]gives all types from A to Z,
and all letters in between.
Oh, Larry.
Oh!
I've grabbed it. I've got it.
They never let me win.
Forward. Forward with the Light Brigade.
Hey!
Oh!
Does this remind you of Bournemouth?[br]Not really, Les, no.
Was that a porpoise?
You should buy a costume and come in, Mum.
Ooh, no. Not at my age.
We get all the fun we need from sitting down[br]with a ball of knobbly wool.
Oh, don't be a wimp.
Whoa. Whoa.
When's Margo coming back?
Dunno. Mother took her shopping.
How do you spell scimitar?
You don't expect me to read that drivel[br]when you've finished it.
All right. Stop scribbling. By tomorrow[br]I want you to have written out all your tables.
Eight times.
I'll tell Mummy and big bro you won't work.
They'll have you off to that boarding school in[br]Surrey they've no doubt got lined up for you.
Where's your annoying friend?[br]Gone.
You're not still writing that novel?[br]No.
Birthday list.[br]Thank God.
Two obsessive writers in the family,[br]that's all we need.
What do you want, then?
I've done a list for each person.
And here's yours.
A boat.[br]I'm not allowed to use the Sea Cow.
You could make me one.[br]Do you know how much time that would take?
You know so much about boats.
Oh.
All right.
You should have a birthday party, Gerry.
Small but distinguished gathering,[br]ten people you like best.
Thank you, Larry.[br]Pleasure. I'll get Mother to arrange it.
Not only I, but each family member[br]invited ten people to the party.
Unfortunately, we didn't all invite the same ten.
The result was that Mother,[br]on the eve of the party,
suddenly discovered[br]we were going to have not ten guests, but 50.
Larry suggested the puppies be called[br]Widdle and Puke, and the names stuck.
Hello.
When we gots married, I asked my wife,
''How many childrens you want?''[br]She says two.
I gives her two, vadoom, vadoom.
Then I gets her sewed up.
Uh?
13 years old, uh?
Who would believe it?
Right!
Can we get this over with?
He doesn't like it.[br]I do, I love it.
Get it into the water, so we can go back to bed.
She needs a name before we can launch her.[br]Jolly Roger. Can I go now?
No. Something more interesting.
Arbuckle?
Bootle.
The Bumtrinket.[br]Don't be rude, Larry.
I name this boat the Bootle Bumtrinket.
Told you the mast was too big.
He'll have to go, of course.
Yeah.
Who? Where?
Peter.
He and Margo are obviously...
becoming too fond of each other.
Look, I hardly want him as a relative,
but you can't blame them for wanting to...[br]Yes.
I don't want to hear your current word for it,[br]thank you.
I think it's too short now.
This is so unfair.[br]It's so unfair.
I love him.
You love him. I know.
Love is lovely.
But terrible.
There's no other work[br]for Peter here on the island.
He'll have to go back to Athens.
I'll shoot him if he tries to come back.
A little bit reactionary, perhaps.
You've got to be firm[br]under these circumstances.
Family honour is at stake.
I put the word out. They'll stop him[br]at the docks if he try to get back in.
I have nothing more to say to you,[br]so if I can show you out...
I hate you!
You've destroyed my life.
Margo, darling.[br]I would love you to find someone,
but I fear Peter was not the one.
What do you know?[br]I know how to protect my family.
You do not![br]Yes, I do!
I'm staying in my bedroom.[br]I don't want to see anyone.
Somebody's been pinching things[br]from the Sea Cow.
Not on Corfu. Who?[br]Fishermen, presumably.
I'm worried about Margo.[br]Mmm.
She's been in her room for nearly a week.
She's never refused food before.[br]I saw Gerry with a tray.
Well, yes, she takes it from him.
Perhaps Peter wouldn't have been so bad.
He was appalling.[br]Yes, he was, wasn't he?
He's threatened to come back[br]and snatch Margo away.
Apparently.
Aw.
How romantic.
What's happening?
Margo's done something silly. Where is she?
Margo!
Thank God. I thought[br]you'd done something terrible to yourself.
Someone's shot Peter![br]What's wrong?
Shut up till we know what's happening.
I need to check he's all right.
Come on. Back in.[br]Leave him alone, you cowards!
Burglars.
Where? Get the bloody dogs in.
Everyone, shut up!
I need to check if Peter's all right.[br]What? I wasn't shooting at him!
It was my burglar warning device.
Did you expect nobody would hear?
I'm protecting the family's assets[br]from those fishermen.
In case they were out there.
I I don't even have to get out of bed,[br]you see.
Look. Shall I demonstrate?[br]No!
No, you madman!
They're too far away to get badly hurt.
Animals and explosions all day, bloody great[br]12-gun salutes in the middle of the night.
There's eccentricity. And then there's stupidity!
Do you have to kill quite so many?
You said I was allowed to hunt.
Poor innocent creatures.[br]It's the hunting season.
They expect to be shot.
How is she?
Still sad. Reading poetry.
Who?
Um... Tennyson.[br]Ugh.
How can we jolt her out of this?[br]Don't expect me to help,
I believe in free love.[br]No, you don't, you silly boy.
Why doesn't she stop moping around, disguise[br]herself as a peasant and fly into Peter's arms?
Lugaretzia, that's horrible.[br]I'm so sorry that Roger bit you.
I'd no idea wild boar was so big.
Do be careful.[br]It's perfectly safe.
Unless they charge. You can always vault over it.
Vault over a charging boar?[br]Why not?
Well, do come with me today[br]to the marshes and demonstrate.
I don't profess to be a man of action, Les,
I supply the ideas,[br]it's your job to carry them out.
You always think the things
other people do are simple.[br]They are.
He's right. You never put your suggestions[br]into practice.
Yes. Are you ever going to actually do anything?
Fine.
My honour's at stake.
Prepare me a gun.
I'm going down to the beach. Don't follow me.
I didn't think it was going to be this...dank.
So, trickiest of all is[br]what's called the right and left,
where you make two kills in quick succession[br]first with the right, then the left barrel.
Sounds easy enough.
You might want to load it.
I know.
Agh!
Hold the gun above your head[br]and don't stand up,
or you'll sink. Stay how you are.
No. Now you've choked the bloody barrels!
Would you rather I was sucked under?[br]Yes!
Ooh. Ah.
Get me out of here.[br]Hold the gun out to me.
Forget the gun, save me!
I can't reach you unless you give me[br]the end of the gun.
Working, working, working, working.
Oh.[br]Oh!
I'm going down. I'm going under.
I'm going under.[br]It's Shelley, it's Shelley all over again.
Ooh. Ooh.
Take it.
Oh, God!
Come on.
Ow![br]Oh.
All right?
Oh, yes.
Having a wonderful time.[br]Good.
And on with the hunting.
I don't know what I'll do, Lugaretzia,[br]if Germany...
You want to gather all your children.
Gather them up and shout at everyone else[br]to keep away.
Makes you very selfish.
How did that go?
Oh.
I should ask Larry.
Don't say a word.
Was that fun?
You seem to be missing a shoe.
Did you fall in a bog?
It's rather windy out there.
Margo, dear, I sometimes wonder[br]if you're quite right.
Oh, leave me alone.
Are you back with us now?
Do I look...
windswept and interesting at all?
No, dear.
Larry's really hitting the brandy.
Well, he's in shock, the poor boy.[br]Mm.
# Greensleeves was all my joy... #
No, not the singing.[br]# ..my delight #
Larry.
Now, come on. Stop being a fool[br]and drink this down at once.
You're a horrible old woman.
I'm sure I've seen you somewhere before.
Yes, well.[br]
I'll put that down to the drink.
Not that you're so different when you're sober.
Morning.[br]Mm.
Fire.
Fire![br]Fire!
Fire! Fire![br]Wake up. The house is on fire!
What's going on?
It's not me this time.[br]Larry's on fire!
Larry.
Larry! For heaven's sake, wake up!
Wake up!
The room's on fire!
You all put it out. I've got a bit of a headache.
Pour something on it.
No, no, no! Not brandy, you...[br]
Please use it. I've had enough.
Why did he do that? Are you trying[br]to freeze me to death?
Oh, shut up!
Oh, this is nice. Look.[br]Organdie with puffed sleeves.
Henry's written a filthy book!
Excellent.
Oh, now that is...
Look at that. Telescopic sight.
Bolt-action.[br]Great Aunt Hermione wonders how you are.
Mother, I'm buying a chimpanzee.
No, you're not.[br]
She claims doctors don't hold out[br]much hope for her.
Have they ever?[br]She was doubtful about us rushing to Corfu,
but after their winter,[br]she thinks it wasn't stupid.
A chipmunk, then?[br]-No.
Oh, Lord.[br]What?
Oh, no.
The doctors have advised a warm climate.
She's coming to stay.[br]No!
It's grim enough being shown[br]Lugaretzia's latest suppurating wound,
without having a great aunt[br]dying all over the place.
Write and tell her there's no room.[br]I can't.
I told her what a big villa we have.[br]I've got it.
I've got it. I'll write to her[br]and tell her that you've died.
Larry![br]Larry!
Fine. We'll move to a smaller villa,
which will also force jungle boy[br]to get rid of some of his bloody animals.
They're less trouble than your silly friends.[br]Oh, yes?
You're an animal too. Let's get rid of you first.
It is too big, this house.
The stairs are really tiring.
Children. We are not moving again.
We moved in and the bats[br]that were living there moved out.
As Margot said, typically,
''A change is as good as a feast. ''
I'm sorry we didn't believe you[br]when you said you got seasick, Spiro, dear.
Will you survive?
Excuse me.
Hello. Stop.
I I think...
How you doing, Spiro?
Feeling better?
Yeah.
Perhaps we should have come by car.
I adore this place.
Look away, Margo, dear.
Theo.[br]Hm?
Are you all right?[br]No, I'm fine.
Yes. No, I'm very good.
Look at those gulls flying over.
Yes. Yes.
All the nice gulls love a sailor.
Do you know, I should like to be buried here.
Oh, make up your mind.
I'm afraid I heard on the wireless yesterday[br]that Germany...
Shhh. Stop.
Let's not spoil it.
Oi!
Son of a bitch fish.
The magic of the island had settled over us[br]as gently and clingingly as pollen.
Each day had a tranquillity[br]and timelessness about it.
We wished that it would never end.
Where have you been?[br]How do you mean?
You've been gone for two days.
You knew where I was.[br]No. Where?
Out and about.
Please.
No more long trips.
How will you ever put on shoes again?
And be normal?
Oh, do talk to me. You are not a wild animal.[br]I've given up shoes.
Oh, you're back. What have you brought[br]this time, a woolly mammoth?
Did you feed everyone?[br]Yes.
More or less.
Oh, aren't they sweet?
Gerry, why do you bring all these animals back?
How revolting.
Golly. What's them?[br]Magpies.
Oh, maggenpies, huh?[br]What's you going to do with them bastards?
Magpies, Spiro, magpies.
Maggenpies.
These are maggenpies.
No.
Mag-pies.
Yeah. Maggenpies.
Maaag...
pies.
Maaaggenpies.
What's he brought now?[br]Maggenpies.
Awful thieves, maggenpies,[br]put them back where you found them.
I can't. Their mother won't take them.[br]I'll train them.
It will be all right.[br]I could easily shoot them if you'd like.
No.[br]No, thank you.
Come on, Mum. You know you want to.
No. I've changed my mind.
Too old.
Haven't got a figure for swimming.[br]Don't be ridiculous, woman.
Oh, come on. If not now, when?
I won't be here forever.
Whoa. I'm gonna drown, I'm gonna drown.[br]
All right?[br]You can't wear that.
It looks like it was made in 1920.[br]It was all they had. Sorry.
I should have popped over to Paris.
Mrs Durrell, you look splendid.[br]Thank you.
Don't forget to shake the fish out[br]when you come out of the water.
Shut up! This is my moment[br]and I don't want you spoiling it.
Going in, the creature is going in.[br]
All right.
Ooh.
Ow! Look, get the dog off.
Oh!
Eat up, Roger.
Here. Mrs Durrell, give me your hand.
You're all right. You're all right.
Oh. Ooh. The bum monster.
That hasn't seen the sun for a long time.
Oh, my God.
Don't be embarrassed, I am a doctor.
Although I am off duty at the moment.
Gerry.
Stay back. Stay back.
OK. I...
I'm the king of the ship.[br]You should be proud of yourself.
Not so sure.
Who was it who said, ''If you can control your[br]family, you've gone terribly wrong somewhere''?
Aristotle?
No.
Was it me?
Yes.
My mother steered her vessel[br]full of strange progeny
through the stormy seas of life with great skill.
As Larry rightly pointed out, ''We can be[br]proud of the way we brought her up. ''
Oh, that sodding boy!
And that was that.
No.
I think you're old enough to sort yourselves out.
They've made an awful mess of your papers.
Those bloody birds!
No more wildlife!
Gerald!
Gerald!
Ah.
Here.
Oh.
Theo. What a pleasure.[br]Theo.
I'm afraid I have some bad news, Mrs Durrell.
What's Gerry done?
No, nothing.
I think you should return to England[br]with your family.
Has Larry been annoying people again?
Britain and Greece[br]will shortly be engulfed by war.
If you leave it too late,[br]you'll have grave difficulties getting back.
Can't bear to tell Gerry.
Has Leslie finally shot someone?
We have to leave the island.
Right.
Bad luck, Theo.
You get Gerry's animals to look after.
Yes.
No, I will do it.
Theo.
So sorry, Gerry.
We have to go home.
Agh!
Oh.
Oh, it feels like I say goodbye[br]to my own peoples.
I feels you belong to me.
I'm coming back, Spiro.
Honestly.
You come back, honest?
Goodbye.
Bye.
Bye.[br]Bye-bye, Margo.
I'll miss you.
Hey, hey, hey.
No more shootings for you now, huh?[br]There's a war on.
Oh.
I'm, er...actually staying, Spiro.
Sorry.
Boys.
Goodbye, Lugaretzia.
And, er, good luck with all...
your illnesses.
Right. I've, er...scribbled down[br]some essential reading.
Nothing, you know, too arduous.
But I think...
the most important thing is, um...
Well...
I'm sorry. I don't mean to cry.
Theo!
Don't forget to feed Quasimodo.
And Spiro, you know Aleka likes fresh sardines.
Don't worry.[br]Everything's under control.
What is Aleka?[br]The huge, angry seagull.
You'll need some thick gloves. Good luck.
So when are we coming back?
Soon, Gerry, soon.
After you've had a bit of an education.
So what have I just had?
Erm...
Not sure.
So is it downhill from now on?
Yes, I rather think it is.[br]Shall I fire off a ceremonial ten-gun salute?
No.[br]Absolutely not.
You know what, Gerry?[br]They're all right, your stories.
Not terribly flattering...
but pretty good.
It was nice to be all together.
Yes, it was.
What a rude man.
What?
''Description of passengers:[br]one travelling circus and staff.''
An odd thing to write.
Some people really are peculiar.
Back in England,[br]Mother insisted I went to school,
despite my protestation[br]that I liked being half-educated.
You were so much more surprised at everything[br]when you were ignorant.
